      <title>Uniform bound on common periodic points for families of regular plane polynomial automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two one-dimensional families $f$ and $g$ of regular plane polynomial automorphisms parameterised by an algebraic curve $B$, all defined over some number field $K$, such that one of them is dissipative, we prove that at any parameter $b\in B(\mathbb{C})$, either $f_b$ and $g_b$ share a common iterate, or the number of their common periodic points $\mathrm{Per}(f_b) \cap \mathrm{Per}(g_b)$ is bounded by a uniform constant $D$ (independent of the parameter $b$). We thus extend a result of Mavraki and Schmidt for rational maps to our setting.</description>

      <title>Phonon gap analysis for equilibria of perturbed almost-periodic Frenkel-Kontorova models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For generalized Frenkel-Kontorova models subjected to almost-periodic media, employing both the KAM method and the approach of `anti-integrable' limits, two different types of equilibria are obtained in \cite{an2024kamtheoryalmostperiodicequilibria} and \cite{du2024anti} respectively.
  We study the phonon gap around these equilibria and we find that the KAM equilibria do not have a phonon gap but the equilibria obtained by anti-integrable limits do have.</description>

      <title>Relative Chaos for $C_0$-Semigroups Beyond Topological Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate instability phenomena for linear evolution equations within the framework of $C_0$--semigroups on infinite--dimensional spaces. We show that Devaney chaos, being formulated in purely topological terms, may depend on the choice of topology and therefore fail to capture intrinsic dynamical behavior. To address this issue, we introduce a trajectory--based notion of relative chaos, defined with respect to a reference solution and measured in a fixed, physically meaningful norm. This criterion is independent of topological refinements and is shown to be strictly weaker than classical Devaney chaos. Its relevance is illustrated on boundary--driven reaction--diffusion--transport semigroups.</description>

      <title>Induced dynamics and quasifactors for minimal equicontinuous actions on Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal equicontinuous action of a group $G$ on a Stone space $X$ is called a subodometer. If such a subodometer arises from a group rotation, we refer to it as an odometer. For subodometers $(X,G)$ we show that the hyperspace $\mathcal{H}(X)$ - given by all closed subsets of $X$ and the Vietoris topology - decomposes into subodometers. We show that an infinite subodometer is an odometer if and only if $\mathcal{H}(X)$ decomposes into factors of $(X,G)$.
  Similarly, we consider $\mathcal{M}(X)$, the space of regular Borel probability measures equipped with the weak-* topology. We show that for a subodometer $(X,G)$ also the connected space $\mathcal{M}(X)$ decomposes into subodometers. We prove that an infinite subodometer $(X,G)$ is an odometer if and only if $\mathcal{M}(X)$ decomposes into factors of $(X,G)$. For this, we study different notions of regular recurrence.
  Furthermore, we study the disjointness of minimal actions to subodometers and show that this disjointness can be detected from the pairwise disjointness of finite factors. Using this we prove that a minimal action is disjoint from all subodometers if and only if it has a connected maximal equicontinuous factor.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Bounded Linear Operators on Ordered Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is a concept encountered frequently in the study of ecological and epidemiological models. It is routinely used to determine the stability of an extinction or a disease-free fixed point or steady state. It is well-known that for linear models described by non-negative matrices, the spectral radius of the matrix is always contained in an interval with endpoints $1$ and $R_0$. Here we extend these results to more general cone-preserving bounded linear operators acting on Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Transonic Buffet Modeling via Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transonic flow over aircraft wings, shock-boundary-layer interactions can give rise to transonic buffet, which degrades maneuverability through unsteady aerodynamic loads. Beyond its practical importance, two-dimensional transonic buffet represents a canonical example of a global instability for which reduced-order modeling remains challenging due to nonlinearity, sharp spatial gradients, and the coexistence of an unstable equilibrium with an attracting limit cycle. Commonly, reduced-order models of such phenomena capture nonlinear dynamics only in aerodynamic observables, while prediction of the full flow state is achieved through linear representations valid only near the unstable equilibrium or on the limit cycle.
  In this work, we present a reduced-order model that predicts the nonlinear evolution of the full flow field by exploiting the existence of an attracting two-dimensional invariant manifold. We adapt an existing data-driven framework for identifying invariant manifolds and the associated reduced dynamics, making it suitable for scaling to large-scale CFD applications. The invariant manifold is identified as a graph over its tangent space using an iterative encoder-update and the reduced dynamics are obtained via least-squares regression. A subsequent extended normal-form transformation enables physical interpretability of the model through a modal decomposition of the flow.
  The reduced-order model is identified for transonic buffet over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil, showing that it is possible to achieve this accurately using just a single training trajectory. Validation against independent simulations demonstrates accurate prediction of nonlinear behavior, together with reliable reconstruction of the full flow field, particularly in the late-transient and limit-cycle regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasisymmetric uniformization of a special class of metric surfaces known as paper surfaces, constructed as quotients of planar multipolygons via segment pairings, including infinite Type W identifications. These spaces, which arise naturally in dynamical settings, exhibit conic singularities and complex geometric structure. Our goal is to prove that a broad class of such surfaces satisfies Ahlfors 2-regularity and linear local contractibility, which together ensure the existence of a quasisymmetric parametrization onto the standard 2-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a subfield of the field of rational functions in several indeterminates. We present an algorithm that, given a set of generators of such a subfield, finds a simple generating set. We provide an implementation of the algorithm and show that it improves upon the state of the art both in efficiency and the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of simplified generators through several case studies from different application domains, such as structural parameter identifiability. The main algorithmic novelties include performing only partial Gr\"obner basis computation via sparse interpolation and efficient search for polynomials of a fixed degree in a subfield of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation via model reference adaptation for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address data assimilation for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems via the so-called \emph{model reference adaptive system}. Continuing our theoretical developments in \cite{Tram_Kaltenbacher_2021}, we deliver the first practical implementation of this approach for online parameter identification with time series data. Our semi-implicit scheme couples a modified state equation with a parameter evolution law that is driven by model-data residuals. We demonstrate four benchmark problems of increasing complexity: the Darcy flow, the Fisher-KPP equation, a nonlinear potential equation and finally, an Allen-Cahn type equation. Across all cases, explicit model reference adaptive system construction, verified assumptions and numerically stable reconstructions underline our proposed method as a reliable, versatile tool for data assimilation and real-time inversion.</description>

      <title>Optimal Initialization in Depth: Lyapunov Initialization and Limit Theorems for Deep Leaky ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of effective initialization methods requires an understanding of random neural networks. In this work, a rigorous probabilistic analysis of deep unbiased Leaky ReLU networks is provided. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the logarithm of the norm of network activations, establishing that, as the number of layers increases, their growth is governed by a parameter called the Lyapunov exponent. This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning.</description>

Abstract: We establish a weighted simultaneous Khintchine-type theorem, both convergence and divergence, for all nondegenerate manifolds, which answers a problem posed in [Math. Ann., 337(4):769-796, 2007]. This extends the main results of [Acta Math., 231:1-30, 2023] and [Ann. of Math. (2), 175(1):187-235, 2012] in the weighted set-up. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain a multiplicative Khintchine-type convergence theorem for all nondegenerate manifolds, which is a simultaneous analogue of the celebrated result of Bernik, Kleinbock, and Margulis for dual approximation.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Planar Central Configurations in the $N$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degeneracy of central configurations in the planar $N$-body problem makes their enumeration problem hard and the related dynamics appealing. To truly understand the bifurcations of central configurations, we should work in the FULL configuration space which also facilitates the computer-aided methods. The degeneracy is always intertwined with the symmetry of the system of central configurations which makes the problem subtle. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system, we systematically explore the direct method to single out trivial zero eigenvalues associated with translational, rotational and scaling symmetries, thereby isolating the non-trivial part of the Jacobian to study the degeneracy. Four distinct formulations of degeneracy are presented, each tailored to handle different forms of the system appeared in the literature. The method is applied to such well-known examples as Lagrange's equilateral triangle solutions for arbitrary masses, the square configuration for four equal masses and the equilateral triangle with a central mass revealing specific mass values for which degeneracy occurs. Combining with the interval algorithm, the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configurations for arbitrary mass is also established.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a rotating test body in the Schwarzschild space-time. After reduction, this problem reduces to an analysis of a three-degree-of-freedom. Hamiltonian system whose desired trajectories lie on the invariant manifold described by the Tulczyjew condition. An analysis is made of the fixed points of this system which describe the motion of the test body in a circle. New circular orbits are found for which the orbital angular momentum is not parallel to the angular momentum of the test body. Using a Poincare map, bifurcations of periodic solutions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Feedback control of twisted states in the Kuramoto model on nearest neighbor and complete simple graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study feedback control of twisted states in the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on deterministic nearest neighbor graphs containing complete simple ones when it may have phase-lag. Bifurcations of such twisted solutions in the continuum limit (CL) for the uncontrolled KM defined on nearest neighbor graphs that may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse were discussed very recently by using the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory. In this paper we analyze the stability and bifurcations of twisted solutions in the CL for the KM subjected to feedback control. In particular, it is shown that the twisted solutions exist and can be stabilized not only for nearest neighbor graphs but also for complete simple graphs. Moreover, the CL is shown to suffer bifurcations at which the twisted solution becomes unstable and a stable one-parameter family of modulated or oscillating twisted solutions is born, depending on whether the phase-lag is zero or not. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the feedback controlled KM on deterministic nearest neighbor and complete simple graphs.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theorems for Dynamical Systems with Infinite-Time Horizon Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems establish the expressive capacity of neural network architectures. For dynamical systems, existing results are limited to finite time horizons or systems with a globally stable equilibrium, leaving multistability and limit cycles unaddressed. We prove that Neural ODEs achieve $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness -- trajectories within error $\varepsilon$ except for initial conditions of measure $&lt; \delta$ -- over the \emph{infinite} time horizon $[0,\infty)$ for three target classes: (1) Morse-Smale systems (a structurally stable class) with hyperbolic fixed points, (2) Morse-Smale systems with hyperbolic limit cycles via exact period matching, and (3) systems with normally hyperbolic continuous attractors via discretization. We further establish a temporal generalization bound: $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness implies $L^p$ error $\leq \varepsilon^p + \delta \cdot D^p$ for all $t \geq 0$, bridging topological guarantees to training metrics. These results provide the first universal approximation framework for multistable infinite-horizon dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Beyond specific settings, many multi-agent learning algorithms fail to converge to an equilibrium solution, instead displaying complex, non-stationary behaviours such as recurrent or chaotic orbits. In fact, recent literature suggests that such complex behaviours are likely to occur when the number of agents increases. In this paper, we study Q-learning dynamics in network polymatrix normal-form games where the network structure is drawn from classical random graph models. In particular, we focus on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, which is used to analyze connectivity in distributed systems, and the Stochastic Block model, which generalizes the above by accounting for community structures that naturally arise in multi-agent systems. In each setting, we establish sufficient conditions under which the agents' joint strategies converge to a unique equilibrium. We investigate how this condition depends on the exploration rates, payoff matrices and, crucially, the probabilities of interaction between network agents. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and demonstrate that convergence can be reliably achieved in many-agent systems, provided interactions in the network are controlled.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>

Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>
