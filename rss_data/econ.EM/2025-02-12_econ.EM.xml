      <title>Global Ease of Living Index: a machine learning framework for longitudinal analysis of major economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and quality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and comprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living conditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various socio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts. This transparency and accessibility make our work a valuable resource for ongoing research and policy development in quality-of-life assessment.</description>

      <title>Are Princelings Truly Busted? Evaluating Transaction Discounts in China's Land Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper narrowly replicates Chen and Kung's 2019 paper ($The$ $Quarterly$ $Journal$ $of$ $Economics$ 134(1): 185-226). Inspecting the data reveals that nearly one-third of the transactions (388,903 out of 1,208,621) are perfect duplicates of other rows, excluding the transaction number. Replicating the analysis on the data sans-duplicates yields a slightly smaller but still statistically significant princeling effect, robust across the regression results. Further analysis also reveals that coefficients interpreted as the effect of logarithm of area actually reflect the effect of scaled values of area; this paper also reinterprets and contextualizes these results in light of the true scaled values.</description>

      <title>Cover It Up! Bipartite Graphs Uncover Identifiability in Sparse Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of factor models with sparse loading matrices, little attention has been given to formally address identifiability of these models beyond standard rotation-based identification such as the positive lower triangular constraint. To fill this gap, we present a counting rule on the number of nonzero factor loadings that is sufficient for achieving generic uniqueness of the variance decomposition in the factor representation. This is formalized in the framework of sparse matrix spaces and some classical elements from graph and network theory. Furthermore, we provide a computationally efficient tool for verifying the counting rule. Our methodology is illustrated for real data in the context of post-processing posterior draws in Bayesian sparse factor analysis.</description>

      <title>Correcting Selection Bias in Standardized Test Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10642v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the critical issue of sample selection bias in cross-country comparisons using international assessments such as PISA (Program for International Student Assessment). While PISA is widely used to rank educational performance, its reliance on samples of students still in school at age 15 introduces survival bias, potentially distorting comparisons. To address this, I developed an econometric framework based on a quantile selection model. Under a stochastic dominance assumption, the selection-corrected quantile function is partially identified, with point identification achieved under parametric restrictions on the joint distribution of test scores and selection. Applying this method to PISA 2018 data, I demonstrate that correcting for selection bias leads to significant changes in country rankings based on mean performance. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for sample selection bias to ensure accurate and meaningful international educational comparisons.</description>

      <title>Set-Valued Control Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control function approach allows the researcher to identify various causal effects of interest. While powerful, it requires a strong invertibility assumption in the selection process, which limits its applicability. This paper expands the scope of the nonparametric control function approach by allowing the control function to be set-valued and derive sharp bounds on structural parameters. The proposed generalization accommodates a wide range of selection processes involving discrete endogenous variables, random coefficients, treatment selections with interference, and dynamic treatment selections. The framework also applies to partially observed or identified controls that are directly motivated from economic models.</description>

      <title>Improving volatility forecasts of the Nikkei 225 stock index using a realized EGARCH model with realized and realized range-based volatilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper applies the realized exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (REGARCH) model to analyze the Nikkei 225 index from 2010 to 2017, utilizing realized variance (RV) and realized range-based volatility (RRV) as high-frequency measures of volatility. The findings show that REGARCH models outperform standard GARCH family models in both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, driven by the dynamic information embedded in high-frequency realized measures. Incorporating multiple realized measures within a joint REGARCH framework further enhances model performance. Notably, RRV demonstrates superior predictive power compared to RV, as evidenced by improvements in forecast accuracy metrics. Moreover, the forecasting results remain robust under both rolling-window and recursive evaluation schemes.</description>

      <title>The Global Carbon Budget as a cointegrated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Global Carbon Budget, maintained by the Global Carbon Project, summarizes Earth's global carbon cycle through four annual time series beginning in 1959: atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, and CO$_2$ uptake by land and ocean. We analyze these four time series as a multivariate (cointegrated) system. Statistical tests show that the four time series are cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the single stochastic trend driving the nonstationary dynamics of the system. The three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the sinks are linearly related to atmospheric concentrations and that the change in concentrations equals emissions minus the combined uptake by land and ocean. Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests show that a parametrically restricted error-correction model that embodies these physical relations and accounts for the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation cannot be rejected on the data. The model can be used for both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. In an application of the latter, we demonstrate that projections based on this model, using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios, yield results consistent with established climate science.</description>
