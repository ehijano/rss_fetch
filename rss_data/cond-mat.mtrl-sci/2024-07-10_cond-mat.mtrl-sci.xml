      <title>Unveiling the Electronic, Transport, and Migration Properties of the Te-Defect Lattice in DyTe$_{1.8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare-earth ditellurides are known to form two-dimensional square lattice where the strong Fermi surface nesting leads to structural modulation. In contrast to charge density waves, the supercell modulation is accompanied by the formation of the periodic Te vacancy network, where the Te deficiency affects the nesting vector (i.e. the supercell size) via tuning the chemical potential. In this work, first principles electronic structure calculations for the $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ supercell, that commonly appears in this family of tellurides, unveil interesting electronic, transport, and migration properties of the Te defect lattice in DyTe$_{1.8}$. The reconstruction of the Te-deficient square lattice, consisting of a single Te-dimer and a pair Te-trimers per unit cell, gives rise to an out-of-plane polarization, whose direction depends on the position of the dimer. This results in various close-in-energy parallel and antiparallel polarization configurations of successive Te layers depending on the dimer positions. We predict that the orientation of the Te dimers, and hence the corresponding structural motifs, can be reversibly switched between two in-plane perpendicular directions under tensile epitaxial strain via a piezoelectric substrate, resulting in a colossal conductivity switching. Furthermore, the Te-dimer orientations result in asymmetric Fermi surface which can be confirmed by quantum oscillations measurements. Finally, we present numerical results for the migration paths and energy landscape through various divacancy configurations in the presence or absence of epitaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Effect of high pressure synthesis conditions on the formation of high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy materials are often entropy stabilized, meaning that the configurational entropy from multiple elements sharing a single lattice site stabilizes the structure. In this work, we study how high-pressure synthesis conditions can stabilize or destabilize a high entropy oxide (HEO). We study the high-pressure and high-temperature phase equilibria of two well-known families of HEOs: the rock-salt structured compound (Mg,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn)O including some cation substitutions and the spinel structured (Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_3$O$_4$. Syntheses were performed at various temperatures, pressures, and oxygen activity levels resulting in dramatically different synthesis outcomes. In particular, in the rock salt HEO we observe the competing tenorite and wurtzite phases and the possible formation of a layered rock salt phase, while the spinel HEO is highly susceptible to decomposition into a mixture of rock-salt and corundum phases. At the highest tested pressures, 15 GPa, we discover the transformation of the spinel HEO into a metastable modified ludwigite-type structure with nominal formula (Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_4$O$_5$. The relationship between the synthesis conditions and the final reaction product is not straightforward. Nonetheless, we conclude that high-pressure conditions provide an important opportunity to synthesize high entropy phases that cannot be formed any other way.</description>

      <title>Atom-wise formulation of the many-body dispersion problem for linear-scaling van der Waals corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to modeling dispersion interactions and overcoming the inaccurate description of long-range correlation effects in electronic structure calculations is the use of pairwise-additive potentials, as in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)] method. In previous work [Phys. Rev. B 104, 054106 (2021)], we have shown how these are amenable to highly efficient atomistic simulation by machine learning their local parametrization. However, the atomic polarizability and the electron correlation energy have a complex and non-local many-body character and some of the dispersion effects in complex systems are not sufficiently described by these types of pairwise-additive potentials. Currently, one of the most widely used rigorous descriptions of the many-body effects is based on the many-body dispersion (MBD) model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012)]. In this work, we show that the MBD model can also be locally parametrized to derive a local approximation for the highly non-local many-body effects. With this local parametrization, we develop an atom-wise formulation of MBD that we refer to as linear MBD (lMBD), as this decomposition enables linear scaling with system size. This model provides a transparent and controllable approximation to the full MBD model with tunable convergence parameters for a fraction of the computational cost observed in electronic structure calculations with popular density-functional theory codes. We show that our model scales linearly with the number of atoms in the system and is easily parallelizable. Furthermore, we show how using the same machinery already established in previous work for predicting Hirshfeld volumes with machine learning enables access to large-scale simulations with MBD-level corrections.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Field-Like Spin-Torques in CrPt$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological semimetal CrPt$_3$ has potential for generating unconventional spin torques due to its ferrimagnetic ordering, topological band structure, and high anomalous Hall effect. CrPt$_3$ exhibits ferrimagnetic behavior only in its chemically ordered phase and is paramagnetic in its chemically disordered phase. By controlling the growth and annealing temperatures epitaxial films of both chemically ordered and disordered phases of CrPt$_3$ are prepared allowing us to investigate the role of magnetic ordering on unconventional torque generation. We use angle dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second harmonic Hall measurements to probe the spin torques generated from epitaxial CrPt$_3$ in CrPt$_3$/Cu/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures. With current applied along specific directions with respect to the crystal order we reveal unconventional spin torques in both ordered and disordered films. When current flows parallel to the $[1\overline{1}1]$ and $[\overline{1}11]$ directions we observe an unconventional field-like torque that is opposite in sign for the two directions, which lack a mirror plane thus allowing unconventional torques to be generated.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torques from Sputtered MoTe2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and low crystalline symmetry are promising for generating large unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs), such as in-plane field-like (FL) torques and out-of-plane damping-like (DL) torques, which can effectively manipulate and deterministically switch an out-of-plane magnetization without the need for additional external in-plane magnetic fields. Here, we report SOTs generated by magnetron-sputtered 1T' MoTe2/Permalloy (Py; Ni80Fe20)/MgO heterostructures using both spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and second harmonic Hall measurements. We observed unconventional FL and DL torques in our samples due to spins polarized normal to the interface of MoTe2 and Py layers, and studied the influence of crystallographic order and MoTe2 layer thickness on the SOTs. By comparing the Raman spectra of 1T' MoTe2 samples prepared in different ways, we found a tensile strain in sputtered MoTe2 films, which might further enhance the generation of unconventional torques by reducing the symmetry of 1T' MoTe2.</description>

      <title>T2MAT (text-to-materials): A universal framework for generating material structures with goal properties from a single sentence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC)-content autonomously produced by AI systems without human intervention-has significantly boosted efficiency across various fields. However, the AIGC in material science faces challenges in the ability to efficiently discover innovative materials that surpass existing databases, alongside the invariances and stability considerations of crystal structures. To address these challenges, we develop T2MAT (Text-to-Material), a comprehensive framework processing from a user-input sentence to inverse design material structures with goal properties beyond the existing database via globally exploring chemical space, followed by an entirely automated workflow of first principal validation. Furthermore, we propose CGTNet (Crystal Graph Transformer NETwork), a novel graph neural network model that captures long-term interactions, to enhance the accuracy and data efficiency of property prediction and thereby improve the reliability of inverse design. Through these contributions, T2MAT minimizes the dependency on human expertise and significantly enhances the efficiency of designing novel, high-performance functional materials, thereby actualizing AIGC in the materials design domain.</description>

      <title>Reactivity of ultra-thin Kagome Metal FeSn towards Oxygen and Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metal FeSn, consists of alternating layers of kagome-lattice Fe3Sn and honeycomb Sn2, and exhibits great potential for applications in future low energy electronics and spintronics because of an ideal combination of novel topological phases and high-temperature magnetic ordering. Robust synthesis methods for ultra-thin FeSn films, as well as an understanding of their air stability is crucial for its development and long-term operation in future devices. In this work, we realize large area, sub-10 nm epitaxial FeSn thin films, and explore the oxidation process via synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy using in-situ oxygen and water dosing, as well as ex-situ air exposure. Upon exposure to atmosphere the FeSn films are shown to be highly reactive, with a stable ~3 nm thick oxide layer forming at the surface within 10 minutes. Notably the surface Fe remains largely unoxidized when compared to Sn, which undergoes near-complete oxidation. This is further confirmed with controlled in-situ dosing of O2 and H2O where only the Sn2 (stanene) inter-layers within the FeSn lattice oxidize, suggesting the Fe3Sn kagome layers remain almost pristine. These results are in excellent agreement with first principles calculations, which show Fe-O bonds to the Fe3Sn layer are energetically unfavorable, and furthermore, a large formation energy preference of 1.37 eV for Sn-O bonds in the stanene Sn2 layer over Sn-O bonds in the kagome Fe3Sn layer. The demonstration that oxidation only occurs within the stanene layers may provide new avenues in how to engineer, handle and prepare future kagome metal devices.</description>

      <title>Advantages of rapid solidification over casting of Mg-0.4Zn-1Y alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg-Y-Zn magnesium alloy system is commonly recognized for its remarkable combination of high strength and ductility, achieved even with minimal amounts of alloying elements. This exceptional performance is attributed to its unique microstructure, which includes Long-Period Stacking Ordered (LPSO) phases or the distinctive microstructure derived from the LPSO phase, referred to as the Mille-Feuille structure (MFS). This study systematically compares the traditional ingot metallurgy method with the rapid solidification technique, coupled with diverse heat treatments and extrusion processes. Microscopic analyses reveal variations in the presence of LPSO phases, Mille-Feuille structure, and grain size, leading to divergent mechanical and corrosion properties. The rapid solidification approach stands out, ensuring superior mechanical properties alongside a reasonable corrosion rate.</description>

      <title>SG-NNP: Species-separated Gaussian Neural Network Potential with Linear Elemental Scaling and Optimized Dimensions for Multi-component Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of materials at long-time and large-length scales have increasingly been enabled by Machine-learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs). There have been increasing interest on improving the robustness of such models. To this end, we engineer a novel set of Gaussian-type descriptors that scale linearly with the number of atoms, reduce informational degeneracy for multi-component atomic environments and apply them in Species-separated Gaussian Neural Network Potentials (SG-NNPs). The robustness of our method was tested by analyzing the impact of various design choices and hyperparameters on Molybdenum (Mo) SG-NNP performance during training and inference/simulation. With less dimensions, SG-NNPs are shown to have superior atomic forces and total energy predictions than other traditional and ML descriptor-based interatomic potentials on diverse set of materials - Ni, Cu, Li, Mo, Si, Ge, NiMo, Li3N and NbMoTaW. From the obtained results we can observe that the proposed method improves the performance of atomic descriptors of complex environments with multiple species.</description>

      <title>The influence of nitrogen ion implantation on the microstructure and chemical composition of a thin layer on the biodegradable Zn-0.8Mg-0.2Sr substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the influence of the N+ ion implantation process on the microstructure of a biodegradable Zn-0.8Mg-0.2Sr alloy was investigated using various experimental techniques. Microscopic analysis revealed that a fluence of 17x10^17 ions/cm^2 resulted in the oversaturation of pure Zn and Mg2Zn11 surfaces, leading to the formation of nano/micro-porous layers up to 400 nm thick. The behavior of the Zn-0.8Mg-0.2Sr alloy was observed to be similar to that of the individual pure phases, albeit without the creation of pore structures. A limited formation of MgO and Mg3N2 was observed on the alloy surface, although the overall presence of Mg significantly increased from 0.8 to 15 wt.%. This increase was caused by the decomposition of the Mg2Zn11 phase during the process and subsequent diffusion of Mg toward the surface. The absence of Zn3N2 within the samples could be explained by the thermodynamic instability and low Zn-N affinity. Despite the absence of zinc nitride, GD-OES confirmed 10 at. % of nitrogen in the pure zinc, suggesting a possible accommodation of N atoms in the interstitial positions. This study points out to the complex nature of the process and highlights other promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Angle dependent SdH oscillations in Topological Insulator Bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current article investigated the band structure in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), examined the Z2 invariants, and investigated the detailed angle-dependent magneto-transport of up to 10 T (Tesla) and down to 2 K for the Bismuth crystal. The out-of-plane field-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) is positive and is huge to the order of ~104% at 2 K and 10 T. On the other hand, the longitudinal (in-plane) field-dependent MR is relatively small and is negative. The thermal activation energy is also estimated by using the Boltzmann formula from resistivity vs temperature measurement under applied transverse magnetic fields. The topological nature of Bi is confirmed by Z2 invariant calculation using Density functional theory. PBESol bands show trivial but Hybrid functional (HSE) bands show non-trivial topology being present in Bismuth. This article comprehensively studies the dependence of MR oscillations upon the angle between the applied field and the current. The observed oscillations fade away as the angle is increased. This article is an extension of our previous work on Bismuth [1], in which we conducted a comprehensive analysis of its structural and micro-structural properties along with its transport behavior in an applied transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Development of ultrafast four-dimensional precession electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction/microscopy technique enables us to investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of crystal structures in the femtosecond-nanosecond time domain. However, the electron diffraction intensities are in general extremely sensitive to the excitation errors (i.e., deviation from the Bragg condition) and the dynamical effects, which had prevented us from quantitatively discussing the crystal structure dynamics. Here, we develop a four-dimensional precession electron diffraction (4D-PED) system by which time ($t$) and electron-incident-angle ($\phi$) dependences of electron diffraction patterns ($q_x,q_y$) are recorded. Nonequilibrium crystal structure refinement on VTe$_{2}$ demonstrates that the ultrafast change in the crystal structure can be quantitatively determined from 4D-PED. We further perform the analysis of the $\phi$ dependence, from which we can qualitatively estimate the change in the reciprocal lattice vector parallel to the optical axis. These results show the capability of the 4D-PED method for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast crystal structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lattice-tunable substituted iron garnets for low-temperature magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic resonance of iron garnets is at the heart of rich physics and provides a crucial technology used inside microwave components. A barrier still stands in the way of integrated cryogenic devices with iron garnets, because their epitaxy requires paramagnetic substrates that cause large microwave losses at low temperatures. Finding alternative combinations of substrates and magnetic garnets is thus essential to enabling cryogenic integrated magnonics. With this motivation, we develop a new approach to the synthesis of epitaxial garnet films, based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of the iron garnet composition. By substituting a controlled proportion of the iron with additional yttrium, we obtain Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality that can be lattice-matched to yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate suitable for low-temperature applications. Ferromagnetic resonance performed at low temperatures confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetism losses on YSGG. We also show that the Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates, such as gadolinium yttrium scandium gallium garnet and gadolinium scandium gallium garnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also offer ideal lattice matching to YSGG for low-temperature magnetic resonance. The present approach of controlled substitutions in iron garnets to obtain ideal lattice matching with diamagnetic substrates opens a very promising pathway to magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</description>

      <title>Optimization of noncollinear magnetic ordering temperature in Y-type hexaferrite by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching the optimal doping compositions of the Y-type hexaferrite Ba2Mg2Fe12O22 remains a long-standing challenge for enhanced non-collinear magnetic transition temperature (TNC). Instead of the conventional trial-and-error approach, the composition-property descriptor is established via a data driven machine learning method named SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator). Based on the chosen efficient and physically interpretable descriptor, a series of Y-type hexaferrite compositions are predicted to hold high TNC, among which the BaSrMg0.28Co1.72Fe10Al2O22 is then experimentally validated. Test results indicate that, under appropriate external magnetic field conditions, the TNC of this composition reaches up to reaches up to 568 K, and its magnetic transition temperature is also elevated to 735 K.

      <title>Is Large Language Model All You Need to Predict the Synthesizability and Precursors of Crystal Structures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the synthesizability of crystal structures is pivotal for advancing the practical application of theoretical material structures designed by machine learning or high-throughput screening. However, a significant gap exists between the actual synthesizability and thermodynamic or kinetic stability, which is commonly used for screening theoretical structures for experiments. To address this, we develop the Crystal Synthesis Large Language Models (CSLLM) framework, which includes three LLMs for predicting the synthesizability, synthesis methods, and precursors. We create a comprehensive synthesizability dataset including 140,120 crystal structures and develop an efficient text representation method for crystal structures to fine-tune the LLMs. The Synthesizability LLM achieves a remarkable 98.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional synthesizability screening based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability by 106.1% and 44.5%, respectively. The Methods LLM achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, and the Precursors LLM has an 80.2% success rate in predicting synthesis precursors. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables automatic predictions of synthesizability and precursors from uploaded crystal structure files. Through these contributions, CSLLM bridges the gap between theoretical material design and experimental synthesis, paving the way for the rapid discovery of novel and synthesizable functional materials.</description>

      <title>Beyond theory driven discovery: hot random search and datum derived structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data driven methods have transformed the prospects of the computational chemical sciences, with machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) speeding up calculations by several orders of magnitude. I reflect on theory driven, as opposed to data driven, discovery based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), and then introduce two methods which exploit machine learning acceleration. I show how long high throughput anneals, between direct structural relaxation, enabled by ephemeral data derived potentials (EDDPs), can be incorporated into AIRSS to bias the sampling of challenging systems towards low energy configurations. Hot AIRSS (hot-AIRSS) preserves the parallel advantage of random search, while allowing much more complex systems to be tackled. This is demonstrated through searches for complex boron structures in large unit cells. I then show how low energy carbon structures can be directly generated from a single, experimentally determined, diamond structure. An extension to the generation of random sensible structures, candidates are stochastically generated and then optimised to minimise the difference between the EDDP environment vector and that of the reference diamond structure. The distance-based cost function is captured in an actively learned EDDP. Graphite, small nanotubes and caged, fullerene-like, structures emerge from searches using this potential, along with a rich variety of tetrahedral framework structures. Using the same approach, the pyrope, Mg$_3$Al$_2$(SiO$_4$)$_3$, garnet structure is recovered from a low energy AIRSS structure generated in a smaller unit cell with a different chemical composition. The relationship of this approach to modern diffusion model based generative methods is discussed.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency tuning of tunable transmon qubits using alternating-bias assisted annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are one of the leading platforms for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The recent demonstration of post-fabrication tuning of Josephson junctions using alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique and a reduction in junction loss after ABAA illuminates a promising path towards precision tuning of qubit frequency while maintaining high coherence. Here, we demonstrate precision tuning of the maximum $|0\rangle\rightarrow |1\rangle$ transition frequency ($f_{01}^{\rm max}$) of tunable transmon qubits by performing ABAA at room temperature using commercially available test equipment. We characterize the impact of junction relaxation and aging on resistance spread after tuning, and demonstrate a frequency equivalent tuning precision of 7.7 MHz ($0.17\%$) based on targeted resistance tuning on hundreds of qubits, with a resistance tuning range up to $18.5\%$. Cryogenic measurements on tuned and untuned qubits show evidence of improved coherence after ABAA with no significant impact on tunability. Despite a small global offset, we show an empirical $f_{01}^{\rm max}$ tuning precision of 18.4 MHz by tuning a set of multi-qubit processors targeting their designed Hamiltonians. We experimentally characterize high-fidelity parametric resonance iSWAP gates on two ABAA-tuned 9-qubit processors with fidelity as high as $99.51\pm 0.20\%$. On the best-performing device, we measured across the device a median fidelity of $99.22\%$ and an average fidelity of $99.13\pm 0.12 \%$. Yield modeling analysis predicts high detuning-edge-yield using ABAA beyond the 1000-qubit scale. These results demonstrate the cutting-edge capability of frequency targeting using ABAA and open up a new avenue to systematically improving Hamiltonian targeting and optimization for scaling high-performance superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models to describe electrical conduction in quantum dot (QD) constituted films often overlook the effects of geometric disorder. We address related issues by examining the influence of the QD packing fraction (PF) on the charge transport and transmission in QD arrays. Using transfer matrix based algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the transmission across disordered QD assemblies. Our results indicate a critical packing fraction ($PF_c $) of $\sim$ 0.64, marking a transition from a non-conducting to a conducting state, aligning well with experimental observations and analytical predictions. This study enhances the understanding of transport in QD arrays, with implications for designing efficient electronic devices based on disordered nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Dependence of strength of spin-orbit interaction on polarity of interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was experimentally observed that both magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction strength change when the magnetization of the nanomagnet is reversed. This indicates a variation in spin-orbit interaction strength depending on whether the magnetic field penetrates the interface from a ferromagnetic to a non-magnetic metal or vice versa. Systematic measurements of over 100 nanomagnets revealed a consistent, yet unexpected, pattern between variations in magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interactions with magnetization reversal. These changes align along a single straight line with a negative slope, suggesting a complex and indirect relationship. Our findings also suggest the presence of an additional, yet-to-be-identified effect that influences the change in magnetic anisotropy with magnetization reversal, beyond the variations in spin-orbit interaction strength. This finding highlights the complexity of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale and the critical role of magnetization direction in determining anisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS): a model-less technique for in-situ electrochemical characterization of mixed ionic electronic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional properties of mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs) can be radically modified by (de)insertion of mobile charged defects. A complete control of this dynamic behaviour has multiple applications in a myriad of fields including advanced computing, data processing, sensing or energy conversion. However, the effect of different MIECs state-of-charge is not fully understood yet and there is a lack of strategies for fully controlling the defect content in a material. In this work we present a model-less technique to characterize ionic defect concentration and ionic insertion kinetics in MIEC materials: Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS). The proof of concept and advantages of OIS are demonstrated by studying the oxygen (de)insertion in thin films of hole-doped perovskite oxides. Ion migration into/out of the studied materials is achieved by the application of an electrochemical potential, achieving stable and reversible modification of its optical properties. By tracking the dynamic variation of optical properties depending on the gating conditions, OIS enables to extract electrochemical parameters involved in the electrochromic process. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique to effectively characterize the kinetics of single- and even multi- layer systems. The technique can be employed for studying underlying mechanisms of the response characteristics of MIEC-based devices.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a nontrivial quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>3D Imaging of directional multi-scale cellulose nanostructures through multi-directional dark-field neutron tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical biomaterials embody nature's intricate design principles, offering advanced functionalities through the complex, multi-level organization of their molecular and nanosized building blocks. However, the comprehensive characterization of their 3D structure remains a challenge, particularly due to radiation damage caused by conventional X-ray- and electron-based imaging techniques, as well as due to the length scale limitations of scattering-based investigation methods. Here, we present a study utilizing multi-directional dark-field neutron imaging in tomographic mode to visualize the 3D nanoarchitecture of nanocellulose solid foams, a class of sustainable materials possessing complex and highly tunable hierarchical structures. By exploiting the unique properties of neutrons as a probe, this non-destructive method circumvents the inherent limitations of damage-inducing ionizing radiation, preserving the structural and chemical integrity of the biomaterials, and allowing for truly multiscale characterization of the spatial orientation and distribution of cellulose nano fibrils within large-volume samples. In particular, the study showcases the 3-dimensional anisotropic orientation and degree of alignment of nanofibrils with different crystallinity, across various length scales, from nanometers to centimeters. This approach offers a valuable and generally applicable tool for multi-scale characterisation of biobased materials where complex nanoscale arrangements inform macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable classifier based on spin torque driven magnetization switching in electrically connected magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising branch of neuromorphic computing aims to perform cognitive operations in hardware leveraging the physics of efficient and well-established nano-devices. In this work, we present a reconfigurable classifier based on a network of electrically connected magnetic tunnel junctions that categorizes information encoded in the amplitude of input currents through the spin torque driven magnetization switching output configuration. The network can be trained to classify new data by adjusting additional programming currents applied selectively to the junctions. We experimentally demonstrate that a network composed of three magnetic tunnel junctions can learn to classify spoken vowels with a recognition rate that surpasses the performance of software multilayer neural networks with the same number of trained parameters in this task. These results, obtained with the same nano-devices and working principle employed in industrial spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memories (STT-MRAM), constitute an important step towards the development of large-scale neuromorphic networks based on well-established technology.</description>

      <title>Interference of ultrahigh frequency acoustic phonons from distant quasi-continuous sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of propagating acoustic waves is essential for telecommunication applications, quantum technologies, and sensing. Up to now, the electrical generation has been at the core of most implementations, but is technologically limited to a few gigahertz. Overcoming this frequency limit holds the prospect of faster modulators, quantum acoustics at higher working temperatures, nanoacoustic sensing from smaller volumes. Alternatively, the optical excitation of acoustic resonators has unlocked frequencies up to 1 THz, but in most cases, the acoustic energy cannot be efficiently extracted from the resonator into a propagating wave. Here, we demonstrate a quasi-continuous and coherent source of 20 GHz acoustic phonons, based on a ridge waveguide, structured in the vertical direction as a high-Q acousto-optic resonator. The high frequency phonons propagate up to 20 $\mu$m away from the source, with a decay rate of $\sim$1.14 dB/$\mu$m. We demonstrate the coherence between acoustic phonons generated from two distant sources through spatio-temporal interference. This concept could be scaled up to a larger number of sources, which enable a new generation of optically programmed, reconfigurable nanoacoustic devices and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the distribution of elements throughout the solid-solution phase of metallic alloys, thereby modifying the background against which microstructural evolution occurs. Investigating such chemistry-microstructure relationships requires atomistic models that act at the appropriate length scales while capturing the intricacies of chemical bonds leading to SRO. Here we consider various approaches for the construction of training data sets for machine learning potentials (MLPs) for CrCoNi and evaluate their performance in capturing SRO and its effects on materials quantities of relevance for mechanical properties, such as stacking-fault energy and phase stability. It is demonstrated that energy accuracy on test sets often does not correlate with accuracy in capturing material properties, which is fundamental in enabling large-scale atomistic simulations of metallic alloys with high physical fidelity. Based on this analysis we systematically derive design principles for the rational construction of MLPs that capture SRO in the crystal and liquid phases of alloys.</description>

Abstract: The topological magneto-electric effect (TME) is a characteristic property of topological insulators. In this article, we use a simplified coupled-Dirac-cone electronic structure model to theoretically evaluate the THz and far infrared Kerr and Faraday responses of thin films of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with up to $N=10$ septuple layers with the goal of clarifying the relationship between these convenient magneto-optical observables and the TME. We find that for even $N$ the linear Kerr and Faraday responses to an electric field vanish in the low-frequency limit, even though the magnetoelectric response is large and approximately quantized.</description>

      <title>Hydride Units Filled B--C Clathrate: A New Pathway for High-Temperature Superconductivity at Ambient Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of room-temperature superconductors has recently advanced with the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides, although sustaining the superconductivity of hydrides at ambient pressure remains challenging. In parallel, $sp^3$-bonded frameworks comprising lightweight elements (\textit{e.g.}, boron and carbon) have emerged as another avenue for developing ambient-pressure superconductors. However, despite their stability at low pressures, the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) values observed in these materials have not yet reached the impressive benchmarks set by hydride-based superconductors. Here we propose a novel design strategy for achieving high-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure by integrating hydride units into B-C clathrate structures. This approach exploits the beneficial properties of hydrogen, the lightest element, to enhance the superconductivity beyond that of the parent compounds. For instance, our computational predictions indicate that doping SrB$_3$C$_3$ with ammonium (NH$_4$) yields a SrNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ compound with an estimated $T_\text{c}$ of 85 K at ambient pressure -- more than double that of its precursor (31 K). Extensive substitution across the periodic table results in a family of MNHNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ superconductors that are predicted to be superconducting at ambient pressure. These compounds can potentially be synthesized using high-pressure techniques and then quenched to ambient conditions, with the highest predicted ambient-pressure $T_\text{c}$ of 115 K in PbNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$. Our findings present a promising strategy for discovering high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductors at ambient pressure, potentially revolutionizing technologies reliant on superconducting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new high-temperature superconductors that diverge from the copper-based paradigm1-3 carries profound implications for elucidating mechanisms behind superconductivity and may also enable new applications4-8. Here, our investigation reveals that application of pressure effectively suppresses the spin and charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10-{\delta} single crystals, leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of around 30 K at 69.0 GPa. The DC susceptibility measurements confirm a substantial diamagnetic response below Tc, indicating the presence of bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. In the normal state, we observe a "strange metal" behavior, characterized by a linear temperature-dependent resistance extending up to 300 K. Furthermore, the layer-dependent superconductivity observed hints at a unique interlayer coupling mechanism specific to nickelates, setting them apart from cuprates in this regard. Our findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning superconductivity, while also introducing a new material platform to explore the intricate interplay between the spin/charge order, flat band structures, interlayer coupling, strange metal behavior and high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental observations of dilute ion spin ensemble defects in a low-loss single crystal cylindrical sample of CaWO$_4$ cooled to 30 mK in temperature. Crystal field perturbations were elucidated by constructing a dielectrically loaded microwave cavity resonator from the crystal. The resonator exhibited numerous whispering gallery modes with high Q-factors of up to $3\times 10^7$, equivalent to a low loss tangent of $\sim 3\times 10^{-8}$. The low-loss allowed precision multi-mode spectroscopy of numerous high Q-factor photon-spin interactions. Measurements between 7 to 22 GHz revealed the presence of Gd$^{3+}$, Fe$^{3+}$, and another trace species, inferred to be rare-earth, at concentrations on the order of parts per billion. These findings motivate further exploration of prospective uses of this low-loss dielectric material for applications regarding precision and quantum metrology, as well as tests for beyond standard model physics.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>
