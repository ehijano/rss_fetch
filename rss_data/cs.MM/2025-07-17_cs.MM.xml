      <title>Unveiling the Visual Rhetoric of Persuasive Cartography: A Case Study of the Design of Octopus Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designed deliberately, data visualizations can become powerful persuasive tools, influencing viewers' opinions, values, and actions. While researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance, contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in today's digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive visualization.</description>

      <title>POLYCHARTQA: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models with Multilingual Chart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and 26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code, allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding. Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.</description>

      <title>Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with Onscreen/offscreen Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data, the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane (left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric, which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs reasonably well with the stereo audio data.</description>

      <title>InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

      <title>QuMATL: Query-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different annotators often assign different labels to the same sample due to backgrounds or preferences, and such labeling patterns are referred to as tendency. In multi-annotator scenarios, we introduce a novel task called Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (MATL), which aims to capture each annotator tendency. Unlike traditional tasks that prioritize consensus-oriented learning, which averages out annotator differences and leads to tendency information loss, MATL emphasizes learning each annotator tendency, better preserves tendency information. To this end, we propose an efficient baseline method, Query-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (QuMATL), which uses lightweight query to represent each annotator for tendency modeling. It saves the costs of building separate conventional models for each annotator, leverages shared learnable queries to capture inter-annotator correlations as an additional hidden supervisory signal to enhance modeling performance. Meanwhile, we provide a new metric, Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC), to evaluate how effectively models preserve annotators tendency information. Additionally, we contribute two large-scale datasets, STREET and AMER, providing averages of 4300 and 3118 per-annotator labels, respectively. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our QuMATL.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Pipeline Perspective on Video Streaming in Best-Effort Networks: A Survey and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remaining a dominant force in Internet traffic, video streaming captivates end users, service providers, and researchers. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by their problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition (simple heuristics), theory (formal optimization), or machine learning (generalizable data patterns). The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs and use of super resolution. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.</description>

      <title>ICME 2025 Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \&amp; Expo (ICME) 2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement. With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR) and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.</description>
