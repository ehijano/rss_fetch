      <title>Hall-on-Toric: Descendant Laughlin state in the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.</description>

      <title>Spacetime symmetry-enriched SymTFT: from LSM anomalies to modulated symmetries and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.</description>

      <title>Tuning Incommensurate Charge Order in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ and Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BaAl$_4$-type structure family is home to a vast landscape of interesting and exotic properties, with descendant crystal structures hosting a variety of electronic ground states including magnetic, superconducting and strongly correlated electron phenomena. BaAl$_4$ itself hosts a non-trivial topological band structure, but is otherwise a paramagnetic metal. However, the other members of the $A$Al$_4$ family ($A$= alkali earth), including SrAl$_4$ and EuAl$_4$, exhibit symmetry-breaking ground states including charge density wave (CDW) and magnetic orders. Here we investigate the properties of the solid solution series Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ and Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$ using transport, thermodynamic and scattering experiments to study the evolution of the charge-ordered state as it is suppressed with Ba substitution to zero near 50% substitution in both systems. Neutron and x-ray diffraction measurements reveal an incommensurate CDW state in SrAl$_4$ with $c$-axis-oriented ordering vector (0, 0, 0.097) that evolves with Ba substitution toward a shorter wavelength. A similar progression is observed in the Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$ series that also scales with the ordering temperature, revealing a universal correlation between charge-order transition temperature and ordering vector that points to a critical wavevector that stabilizes CDW order in both systems. We study the evolution of the phonon band structure in the Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ system, revealing the suppression of the CDW phase matches the suppression of a phonon instability at precisely the same momentum as observed in experiments, confirming the electron-phonon origin of charge order in this system.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible symmetry and topological holography for modulated SPT in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT (MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole, exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW) and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes (dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.</description>

      <title>Nodal-line semimetals and their variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</description>

      <title>Importance of anisotropic interactions for hard-axis/plane ordering of Ce-based ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo-lattice (KL) compounds often exhibit intriguing magnetic behavior driven by strong crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy and exchange interactions. Recent studies suggest that many Ce-based and Yb-based KL ferromagnets order along the hard-axis or hard-plane determined by their CEF ground state. We performed a survey of Ce-based FM compounds, complemented with new single crystal synthesis, magnetization measurements, and analysis of the CEF scheme. Our results reveal that hard-axis/plane ordering is less common than previously reported, with most compounds ordering along their easy-axis/plane. We also find no clear correlation between the strength of the Kondo effect and whether a compound adopts hard-axis/plane or easy-axis/plane ordering. Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF anisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi and CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions along the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering observed in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the complicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations in a spin-1/2 anisotropic square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>The covariance matrix spectrum of correlated charge insulators reveals hidden connections to Coupled Cluster, Matrix Product, and Rokhsar-Kivelson states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.</description>

      <title>Solving the Hubbard model with Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusive charge transport in the gapped 1D Hubbard model at all finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies relying on hydrodynamic theory and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling have found that in the one-dimensional Hubbard model spin and charge transport are for all temperatures T &gt; 0 anomalous superdiffusive at zero magnetic field, h = 0, and zero chemical potential, {\mu} = 0, respectively. However, this contradicts recent exact results that at very low temperature charge transport rather is normal diffusive. In this Letter we identify the mechanisms that control the different types of temperature dependence of the h = 0 spin and {\mu} = 0 charge transport and find that the latter is normal diffusive for all finite temperatures T &gt; 0, in contrast to the hydrodynamic theory and KPZ scaling predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. These modes have been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(WSMs) (Francesco M.D. Pellegrino et al, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 92}, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we introduce a tilt term to investigate helicon modes in gapless WSMs within a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show that the helicon modes exist in tilted WSMs.</description>

      <title>Topology-ferrimagnetism intertwining via weak interactions in Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common wisdom about quantum many-body systems is that emergent phases typically fall into either the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm or topological classifications. Experimentally realizing the intertwined emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological order remains challenging. Here, we present an experimentally accessible platform for studying magnetic topological states in a spin-orbit-coupled Lieb lattice. Remarkably, we observe the coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number and Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as ferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses combining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a pronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even under weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the Lieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band inversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as inherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same interacting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental implementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman lattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay between symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Quantum Control and Multi-Order Correlations via Terahertz Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of electron interactions in Hubbard models of unconventional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use symmetry arguments to show that the matrix elements of electron-electron interaction on a lattice reach extrema in states composed of wavevectors near high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The mechanism is illustrated by minimal models of cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, where this dependence originates from the wavevector-dependent orbital composition of wavefunctions. We discuss how these dependences can facilitate finite-momentum pairing. Our results provide symmetry-based guidance for the search for new high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Time- and Polarization-Resolved Extreme Ultraviolet Momentum Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Super high capacity of silicon carbon anode over 6500 mAh g-1 for lithium battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As silicon is approaching its theoretical limit for the anode materials in lithium battery, searching for a higher limit is indispensable. Herein, we demonstrate the possible of achieving ultrahigh capacity over 6500 mAh g-1 in silicon-carbon composites. Considering the numerous defects inside the silicon nanostructures, it is deduced the formation of quasi-Bose Einstein condensation should be possible, which can lead to the low viscosity flow of lithium-ions through the anode. At a charge-discharge rate of 0.1C (0.42 A g-1), the initial discharge specific capacity reaches 6694.21 mAh g-1, with a Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 74.71%, significantly exceeding the theoretical capacity limit of silicon. Further optimization of the anode material ratio results in improved cycling stability, with a discharge specific capacity of 5542.98 mAh g-1 and a CE of 85.25% at 0.1C. When the initial discharge capacity is 4043.01 mAh g-1, the CE rises to 86.13%. By training a multilayer perceptron with material parameters as inputs and subsequently optimizing it using a constrained genetic algorithm, an initial discharge specific capacity of up to 7789.55 mAh g-1 can be achieved theoretically. This study demonstrates that silicon-carbon composites have great potential to significantly enhance the energy density of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>Geometric orthogonal metals: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moir\'e heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Large Kohn anomaly and phonon collapse induced by charge density wave in UPt$_2$Si$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.</description>

Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.</description>

      <title>Compressing local vertex functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</description>

Abstract: We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Classification of the anyon sectors of Kitaev's quantum double model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete classification of the anyon sectors of Kitaev's quantum double model on the infinite triangular lattice and for finite gauge group $G$, including the non-abelian case. As conjectured, the anyon sectors of the model correspond precisely to equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the quantum double algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <title>From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the presence of altermagnetism on physical observables in the presence of explicit or spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields. We focus on unconventional superconductivity as a potential source of spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields and derive the symmetry considerations for the transmutation of altermagnets from pure to mixed, which can give rise to unusual phenomena. Based on this analysis, we put forward scenarios that could explain the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking at the superconducting critical temperature in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and the hidden magnetic phase and magnetic memory in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.</description>
