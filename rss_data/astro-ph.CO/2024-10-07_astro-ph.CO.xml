      <title>Measuring Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubble constant ($H_0$) is one of the most important parameters in the standard $\rm \Lambda CDM$ model. The measurements given by two major methods show a gap greater than $4\sigma$, also known as Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic events with millisecond duration, which can be used as cosmological probes with high accuracy. In this paper, we constrain the Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized FRBs. The probability distributions of DM$_{\rm host}$ and DM$_{\rm IGM}$ from IllustrisTNG simulation are used. 69 localized FRBs give the constraint of $H_0=70.41_{-2.34}^{+2.28}$ km/s/Mpc, which lies between early-time and late-time values, thus highlighting its individuality as a cosmological probe. We also use Monte Carlo simulation and direct sampling to calculate the pseudo redshift distribution of 527 unlocalized FRBs from CHIME observation. The median values and fixed scattered pseudo redshifts are both used to constrain Hubble constant. The corresponding constraints of $H_{0}$ from unlocalized bursts are $69.89_{-0.67}^{+0.66}$ km/s/Mpc and $68.81_{-0.68}^{+0.68}$ km/s/Mpc respectively. This result also indicates that the uncertainty of Hubble constant constraint will drop to $\sim1\%$ if the number of localized FRBs is raised to $\sim500$. Above uncertainties only include the statistical error. The systematic errors are also discussed, and play the dominant role for the current sample.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Time Evolution of Compact Binary Systems with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces advanced computational techniques for modeling the time evolution of compact binary systems using machine learning. The dynamics of compact binary systems, such as black holes and neutron stars, present significant nonlinear challenges due to the strong gravitational interactions and the requirement for precise numerical simulations. Traditional methods, like the post-Newtonian approximation, often require significant computational resources and face challenges in accuracy and efficiency. Here, we employed machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), to predict the future evolution of these systems based on extensive simulation data. Our results demonstrate that employing both LSTM and TCN even as black-box predictors for sequence prediction can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy without PINNs as PDE solvers with prior knowledge or inductive bias. By employing LSTM and TCN, we obtained $R^2$ values of 99.74\% and 99.19\% for the evolutionary orbits of compact binaries dataset, respectively. Our models demonstrate the ability to effectively capture the dynamics of the binaries, achieving high prediction performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by a factor of 40, compared to conventional numerical methods. This study paves the way for more effective and computationally scalable approaches to the understanding of gravitational phenomena and predictive modeling in gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Comparison of HMG and flat rotation velocities inferred from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of dark-matter models, unresolved issues require exploring alternatives such as modified gravity theories. In this context, we examine the compatibility of the Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) with galaxy rotation curves inferred from weak-lensing data. The research addresses the existing limitations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which often struggle with universal applicability across different galactic scales. By assuming local validity of General Relativity (GR) and analyzing recent data on circular velocities from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, our findings interpret the galactic dynamics anomaly as a fictitious acceleration inherited from the cosmic expansion, without invoking dark matter. The results indicate that HMG successfully reproduces flat velocity curves on scales of 1 Mpc slightly better than MOND. Therefore, these observations support HMG as a viable gravitational model, highlighting its potential to account for dynamics on galaxies and other scales. Further research with extensive datasets is required to confirm these preliminary insights.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the GW background of Galactic (sub)solar mass primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-component dark matter models, a fraction $f_\text{pbh}$ of the dark matter could be in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) with (sub)solar masses. Some would have formed binaries that presently trace the Milky Way halo of particle dark matter. We explore the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by such a hypothetical population of Galactic PBH binaries and assess its detectability by the LISA experiment. For this purpose, we model the formation and evolution of early-type PBH binaries accounting for GW hardening and binary disruption in the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the present-day Galactic population of PBH binaries is characterized by very high orbital eccentricities $|1-e|\ll 1$. For a PBH mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$, this yields a GW background that peaks in the millihertz frequency range where the LISA instrumental noise is minimum. While this signal remains below the LISA detection threshold for viable $f_\text{pbh}\lesssim 0.01$, future GW observatories such as DECIGO and BBO could detect it if $0.01\lesssim M_{\rm pbh} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$. Furthermore, we anticipate that, after 5 years of observations, LISA should be able to detect $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) loud Galactic PBH binaries of mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$ with a SNR $\geq 5$ if $f_{\rm pbh}=0.01$ (resp. $f_{\rm pbh}=0.001$). Nonlinear effects not considered here such as mass accretion and dynamical capture could alter these predictions.</description>

      <title>Doppler bias: impact of peculiar velocities on color selection and the large scale structure of galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light cone selection effects on cosmic observables must be precisely accounted for in the next generation of surveys, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This will allow us to correctly model the data and extract subtle shifts from general-relativistic effects. We examine the effects of peculiar velocities on color selection in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, with a focus on their implications for the galaxy clustering dipole $P_1(k)$. Using DESI Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) targets, we show that peculiar velocities can shift spectral emission features into or out of filter bands, modifying galaxy colors and thereby changing galaxy selection. This phenomenon mimics the effect of evolution bias, and we refer to it as the Doppler bias, $b_D$. The Doppler bias is of comparable size to the evolution bias at $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1$, where it is largest. This enhances the ELG-LRG (Luminous Red Galaxy) cross-correlation dipole by 15-30%. This could be detectable at the $\sim$4$\sigma$ level for the full DESI survey. Additionally, we found that our $b_D$ estimate is impacted by the incompleteness of the parent ELG sample. Therefore, this work highlights the essential need for careful consideration of spectral-dependent biases caused by peculiar velocities during the selection phase of galaxy surveys, to enable unbiased analyses.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation during the Epoch of Reionization: A CNN Analysis of the 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of dark matter annihilation on the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). Using modified 21cmFAST simulations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate how energy injected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) through dark matter annihilation affects the evolution of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature. Focusing on two annihilation channels, photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) and electron-positron ($e^+e^-$), we examine a broad range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross-sections. Our results show that CNNs outperform traditional power spectrum analysis by effectively distinguishing between subtle differences in simulated 21-cm maps produced by annihilation and non-annihilation scenarios. We also demonstrate that the structure formation boost, driven by dark matter clumping into halos and subhalos, significantly enhances the annihilation signal and alters the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. This enhancement leads to a noticeable effect on the 21-cm signal, including a shift from absorption to emission as dark matter annihilation heats the IGM at lower redshifts. By incorporating observational noise from upcoming radio interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we show that these effects remain detectable despite observational challenges. We find that the dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal distinguishable from the non-annihilation scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-31}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ ($\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-32}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ TeV).</description>

      <title>Classification of radio backgrounds at cosmic dawn and 21-cm signal confirmation using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several ongoing and upcoming radio telescopes aim to detect either the global 21-cm signal or the 21-cm power spectrum. The extragalactic radio background, as detected by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1, suggests a strong radio background from cosmic dawn, which can significantly alter the cosmological 21-cm signal, enhancing both the global signal amplitude and the 21-cm power spectrum. In this paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to check if there is a radio excess over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in mock data, and if present, we classify its type into one of two categories, a background from high-redshift radio galaxies or a uniform exotic background from the early Universe. Based on clean data (without observational noise), the ANN can predict the background radiation type with $96\%$ accuracy for the power spectrum and $90\%$ for the global signal. Although observational noise reduces the accuracy, the results remain quite useful. We also apply ANNs to map the relation between the 21-cm power spectrum and the global signal. By reconstructing the global signal using the 21-cm power spectrum, an ANN can estimate the global signal range consistent with an observed power spectrum from SKA-like experiments. Conversely, we show that an ANN can reconstruct the 21-cm power spectrum over a wide range of redshifts and wavenumbers given the global signal over the same redshifts. Such trained networks can potentially serve as a valuable tool for cross-confirmation of the 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>2D watershed void clustering for probing the cosmic large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic void has been proven to be an effective cosmological probe of the large-scale structure (LSS). However, since voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, they are generally limited to low number density and redshift. We propose to utilize the clustering of two-dimensional (2D) voids identified using Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm without any shape assumption to explore the LSS. We generate mock galaxy and void catalogs for the next-generation Stage IV photometric surveys in $z = 0.8-2.0$ from simulations, develop the 2D void identification method, and construct the theoretical model to fit the 2D watershed void and galaxy angular power spectra. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the 2D watershed void clustering are even comparable to the galaxy angular clustering case, which can be further improved by as large as $\sim30\%$ in the void and galaxy joint constraints. This indicates that the 2D void clustering is a good complement to galaxy angular clustering measurements, especially for the forthcoming Stage IV surveys that detect high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>Tomographic constraint on anisotropic cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We for the first time constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at reionization using Planck PR4 polarization data. Several recent analyses of WMAP and Planck polarization data have found a tantalizing hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence. Ongoing and future CMB experiments will test isotropic cosmic birefringence by improving the absolute angle calibration and understanding the intrinsic parity-odd power spectrum of the Galactic foregrounds. Alternatively, measuring anisotropies in cosmic birefringence and its time evolution is also a key observable to confirm the signal of cosmic birefringence and to investigate its origin. We discuss estimators of anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at different redshifts. We then estimate anisotropic cosmic birefringence generated at reionization from the PR4 data, showing that the power spectrum is consistent with null. We find that the model proposed by Ferreira et al. (2024) is still consistent with the observation. Future full-sky CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and PICO will help tighten the tomographic constraint to test models of cosmic birefringence.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for cosmological model selection and feature importance using Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the ESA Planck mission have strongly supported the current concordance model of cosmology. However, the latest cosmological data release from ESA Planck mission still has a powerful potential to test new data science algorithms and inference techniques. In this paper, we use advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NNs), to discern among different underlying cosmological models at the angular power spectra level, using both temperature and polarisation Planck 18 data. We test two different models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: a modified gravity model: the Hu-Sawicki model, and an alternative inflationary model: a feature-template in the primordial power spectrum. Furthermore, we also implemented an interpretability method based on SHAP values to evaluate the learning process and identify the most relevant elements that drive our architecture to certain outcomes. We find that our NN is able to distinguish between different angular power spectra successfully for both alternative models and $\Lambda$CDM. We conclude by explaining how archival scientific data has still a strong potential to test novel data science algorithms that are interesting for the next generation of cosmological experiments.</description>

      <title>The e-MANTIS emulator: fast and accurate predictions of the halo mass function in $f(R)$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel emulator of the halo mass function, which we implement in the framework of the e-mantis emulator of $f(R)$ gravity models. We also extend e-mantis to cover a larger cosmological parameter space and to include models of dark energy with a constant equation of state $w$CDM. We use a Latin hypercube sampling of the $w$CDM and $f(R)$CDM cosmological parameter spaces, over a wide range, and realize a large suite of more than $10000$ $N$-body simulations of different volume, mass resolution and random phase of the initial conditions. For each simulation in the suite, we generate halo catalogues using the friends-of-friends halo finder, as well as the spherical overdensity algorithm for different overdensity thresholds. We decompose the corresponding halo mass functions on a B-spline basis, and use this decomposition to train an emulator based on Gaussian processes. The resulting emulator is able to predict the halo mass function for redshifts $\leq 1.5$ and for halo masses $M_h\geq10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$. The typical HMF errors for SO haloes with $\Delta=200\mathrm{c}$ at $z=0$ in $w$CDM (respectively $f(R)$CDM) are of order of $\epsilon_0\simeq1.5\%$ ($\epsilon_0\simeq4\%$) up to a transition mass $M_t\simeq2\cdot10^{14}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ ($M_t\simeq6\cdot10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$). For larger masses, the errors are dominated by shot-noise and scale as $\epsilon_0\cdot\left(M_h/M_t\right)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\simeq0.9$ ($\alpha\simeq0.4$) up to $M_h \sim 10^{15}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$. Independently of this general trend, the emulator is able to provide an estimation of its own error as a function of the cosmological parameters, halo mass, and redshift. The e-mantis emulator, which is publicly available, can be used to obtain fast and accurate predictions of the halo mass function in the $f(R)$CDM and $w$CDM non-standard cosmological models.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) from theSloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS) have recently found strong statistical evidence for parity violation. If this signal is of genuine physical origin, it must stem from beyond-Standard Model physics, most likely during the very early Universe, prior to decoupling ($z$$\sim$$1,020$). Since the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) features imprint at decoupling, they are expected in the parity-odd galaxy 4PCF, and so detecting them would be an additional piece of evidence that the signal is genuine. We demonstrate in a toy parity-violating model how the BAO imprint on the parity-odd 4PCF. We then outline how to perform a model-independent search for BAO in the odd 4PCF, desirable since, if the signal is real, we may not know for some time what model of e.g. inflation is producing it. If BAO are detected in the parity-odd sector, they can be used as a standard ruler as is already done in the 2PCF and 3PCF. We derive a simple formula relating the expected precision on the BAO scale to the overall parity-odd detection significance. Pursuing BAO in the odd 4PCF of future redshift surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Spherex, and Roman will be a valuable additional avenue to determine if parity violation in the distribution of galaxies is of genuine cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass and ultralight dark matter mass from the Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model where the small neutrino masses are generated via the Higgs mechanism, mediated by an ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field with a mass $m\gtrsim 10^{-23} eV$ and a characteristic energy scale of $O(10) eV$. The resulting neutrino masses, as well as the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, are consistent with cosmological observations. The phase transition temperature for spontaneous symmetry breaking of ULDM occurs near the grand unification theory (GUT) scale. In this framework, neutrino masses can vary with spacetime, a feature that may be experimentally detectable by neutrino oscillation experiments. Additionally, we explore a scenario where the tiny ULDM mass is generated through radiative corrections via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, starting from a massless field theory. Our model addresses both the neutrino mass and ULDM mass puzzles through a unified mechanism, offering insights into possible extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Connecting the growth of galaxies to the large-scale environment in a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z~3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct link between large-scale environment and galaxy properties is very well established in the local universe. However, very little is known about the role of the environment for galaxy growth before the peak of the cosmic star formation history at $z&gt;3$ due to the rarity of high-redshift, overdense structures. Using a combination of deep, multiwalength observations, including MUSE, JWST, Chandra, HST and ground-based imaging, we detect and study the properties of a population of star-forming galaxies in the field of a hyperluminous quasar at $z\approx3.25$ associated with the giant Ly$\alpha$ nebula MQN01. We find that this region hosts one of the largest overdensity of galaxies found so far at $z&gt;3$, with $\rho/\bar{\rho}=53\pm17$ within $4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2$ and $|\Delta v|&lt;1000\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$ from the quasar, providing a unique laboratory to study the link between overdense regions and galaxy properties at high redshift. Even in these rare overdense regions, galaxies are forming stars at a rate consistent with the main sequence at $z\approx3$, demonstrating that their SFR is regulated by local properties correlated with their stellar mass rather than by their environment. However, the high-mass-end of the stellar mass function is significantly elevated with respect to that of galaxies in the field at $\log(M_\star/{M_\odot})\gtrsim10.5$, suggesting that massive galaxies in overdense regions build-up their stellar mass earlier or more efficiently than in average regions of the universe. Finally, the overdensity of color-selected Lyman break galaxies observed on larger scales, across $\approx24\times24\rm\,cMpc^2$, is found to be aligned toward the structure traced by the spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies identified with MUSE in the inner $4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2$, suggesting that this highly overdense region could further extend up to a few tens of comoving Mpc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing in wave optics is a rich field combining caustic singularities, general relativity and interference phenomena. We present a detailed evaluation of wave optics effects resulting from the frame-dragging of a rotating star modeled by a Lense-Thirring spacetime. We demonstrate that, contrary to what was previously stated in the literature, the spin of the star leaves an intricate imprint on the interference fringes and the caustics of the lensed source. This interference pattern can in principle be used to directly measure the spin of the lens.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in a Perturbative Bianchi I Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is straightforward to take the gravitational wave solution to first order in $v/c$ far from a binary source in a Minkowski background and adapt it to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, representing an expanding isotropic homogeneous universe. We find the analogous solution for a slightly anisotropic background, which may be a more accurate description of our universe, and we use a perturbative form of the Bianchi I metric and demonstrate how the waveform differs. Using supernova anisotropy data as a reference, we show that the assumption of a Bianchi I background could imply a 3.2\% difference in inferred luminosity distance compared to what would be inferred under the assumption of the FLRW background. Therefore, the background spacetime used for the inference of the Hubble parameter from gravitational wave data should be considered carefully.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Particle Production of Scalars: Analytic and Numerical Approaches Including Early Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ly$\alpha$ radiation force on super-Eddington accretion onto a massive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viability of super-Eddington accretion remains a topic of intense debate, crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. However, the impact of Ly$\alpha$ radiation force on this issue remains poorly understood. We investigate the propagation of the Ly$\alpha$ photons and evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force within a spherically symmetric accreting HI gas onto the central black hole. We solve the radiation transfer equation, incorporating the destruction processes of Ly$\alpha$ photons through two-photon decay and collisional de-excitation. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ photons, originating in the HII region around black holes, suffer from multiple resonance scattering before being destroyed via two-photon decay and collisional de-excitation. Hence, the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force undergoes a significant amplification, surpassing gravity at the innermost section of the HI region. This amplification, quantified as the force multiplier, reaches approximately 130 and remains nearly constant, regardless of the optical depth at the line center, provided the optical thickness of the flow is within the range of $10^{10-14}$. The requisite lower limit of the product of gas density and black hole mass to realize the super-Eddington accretion is found to be in the range $(2-{40}) \times 10^9 M_\odot\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which is a few to tens of times larger than the minimum value obtained without accounting for the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force. The pronounced amplification of the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force poses a substantial challenge to the feasibility of super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>Matter--Geometry interplay in new scalar tensor theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy--momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the $f(R, G_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson--Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine--tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as follows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated, e.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed neutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges in the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to washout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects decouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks to the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in this scenario, discussing the decay of the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field and the interactions between the right-handed neutrinos and the standard model particles.</description>

      <title>New collider implications on a strongly first order EWPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to understand the early history of the universe, and to test baryogenesis models, determining the nature of the electroweak phase transition is imperative. The order and strength of this transition is strongly correlated to relatively large deviations in the $hhh$ coupling. In models where a considerable part of the $hhh$ coupling deviation is caused by charged particle loops, the $h\gamma\gamma$ coupling is also expected to deviate considerably. In this talk, by using a model-independent approach, I explain how to obtain conditions that are sufficient for a strongly first order phase transition. After the $h\gamma\gamma$ coupling is determined with precision at the HL-LHC, these conditions can be tested at Future Linear Colliders by measurements of the $hhh$ coupling, to conclusively determine the nature of the electroweak phase transition and the viability of electroweak baryogenesis on models with new charged scalars.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $IN^2$ on the curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between the vector fields and the inflaton $I$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore a regime where $I\gg 1$. This regime has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Low-Scale Inflationary Magnetogenesis without Baryon Isocurvature Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetogenesis is an intriguing possibility to explain the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs). However, the baryon isocurvature problem has recently been pointed out, ruling out all magnetogenesis models operating above the electroweak scale. In this letter, we show that lower-scale inflationary scenarios with a Chern-Simons coupling can evade this problem. We propose concrete inflationary models whose reheating temperatures are lower than the electroweak scale and numerically compute the amount of magnetic fields generated during inflation and reheating. We find that, for lower reheating temperatures, the magnetic helicity decreases significantly. It is also possible to generate fully helical magnetic fields by modifying the inflaton potential. In both cases, the produced magnetic fields can be strong enough to explain the observed IGMFs, while avoiding the baryon isocurvature problem.</description>

      <title>How informative are summaries of the cosmic 21-cm signal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal will bring data-driven advances to studies of the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio telescopes such as the SKA will eventually map the HI fluctuations over the first billion years - the majority of our observable Universe. With such large data volumes, it becomes increasingly important to develop "optimal" summary statistics, allowing us to learn as much as possible about the CD and EoR. In this work we compare the constraining power of several 21-cm summary statistics, using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, $\det F$. Since we do not have an established "fiducial" model for the astrophysics of the first galaxies, we compute the distribution of $\det F$ across the prior volume. Using a large database of cosmic 21-cm lightcones that include realizations of telescope noise, we compare the following summaries: (i) the spherically-averaged power spectrum (1DPS), (ii) the cylindrically-averaged power spectrum (2DPS), (iii) the 2D Wavelet scattering transform (WST), (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN), (v) an information-maximizing neural network (IMNN), and (vi) the combination of 2DPS and IMNN. Our best performing individual summary is the 2DPS, having relatively high Fisher information throughout parameter space. Although capable of achieving the highest Fisher information for some parameter choices, the IMNN does not generalize well, resulting in a broad distribution. Our best results are achieved with the concatenation of the 2DPS and IMNN. The combination of only these two complimentary summaries reduces the recovered parameter variances on average by factors of $\sim$6.5 - 9.5, compared with using each summary independently. Finally, we point out that that the common assumption of a constant covariance matrix when doing Fisher forecasts using 21-cm summaries can significantly underestimate parameter constraints.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical power-law lens mass model parameters, often introducing additional empirical parameters and constraints from high resolution imagery. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) in order to constrain both lens and cosmological parameters for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the timescape model. We then generate large mock data sets to further investigate the choice of cosmology on fitting simple power-law lens models. In agreement with previous results, we find that in combination with single isothermal sphere parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\mathrm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\mathrm v0}\to0.73$ and closely matches values that best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and the cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\mathrm v0}\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for timescape fits to both timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. With larger datasets soon available, separation of cosmology and lens models must be addressed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Primordial B-mode Detection: Comprehensive Delensing Pipelines for Improved Sensitivity to $r$</title>

Abstract: Recognizing the impact of contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by Large Scale Structure, we examine delensing methods to enhance sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in primordial B-mode detection experiments. This study presents a realistic pipeline to improve $r$ constraints using foreground-cleaned maps with negligible residuals. The pipeline, based on simulations, is adaptable for future experiments. We focus on two delensing approaches: (1) subtracting the gradient-order lensing B-mode template, computed by convolving the E-mode with the lensing potential, from the observed B-mode signal; and (2) remapping observations using the estimated inverse deflection angle. For parameter constraints, we employ three models to reduce $r$ uncertainty and bias, finding consistent uncertainties across models, though biases vary due to the multipole-dependence of the delensing fraction. %We demonstrate the pipeline using simulated maps from future CMB polarization experiments, including a small-aperture (sub-1m) telescope, a large-aperture (6m) telescope, and a future space mission (3m). We demonstrated this pipeline using simulated observation maps from future CMB polarization experiments, which included current representative ground-based small aperture telescopes (sub-1m), next-generation ground-based large aperture telescopes (6m), and highly competitive future space-based medium aperture missions (3m). Results show a delensing efficiency of 40\% with the small-aperture telescope alone, increasing to 65\% when combined with the large-aperture telescope, and 80\% with the satellite mission. These lead to reductions in $r$ uncertainty by 46\% for ground-based and 63\% for space missions. The most promising method adds the lensing template B-mode as an additional frequency channel, minimizing bias on $r$.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>CombineHarvesterFlow: Joint Probe Analysis Made Easy with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently sample the joint posterior of two non-covariant experiments with a large set of nuisance parameters. Specifically, we train an ensemble of normalizing flows to learn the posterior distribution of both experiments. Once trained, we can use the flows to reweight $\mathcal{O} (10^9)$ samples from both measurements to compute the joint posterior in seconds -- saving up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ ton of $\text{CO}_2$ per Monte Carlo run. Using this new technique we find joint constraints between the Dark Energy Survey $3 \times 2$ point measurement, South Pole Telescope and Planck CMB lensing and a BOSS direct fit full shape analyses, for the first time. We find $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.32^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and $S_8 = 0.79 ^ {+0.01}_ {-0.01}$. We release a public package called {\tt CombineHarvesterFlow} (https://github.com/pltaylor16/CombineHarvesterFlow) which performs these calculations.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using LISA Bright Standard Sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set for launch in the mid-2030s, will enhance our capability to probe the universe through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary black holes (BBHs) across a broad range of cosmological distances. LISA is projected to observe three classes of BBHs: massive BBHs (MBBHs), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and stellar mass BBHs. This study focuses on MBBHs, which are anticipated to occur in gas-rich environments conducive to producing powerful electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, positioning them as excellent candidates for bright sirens. By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from these bright sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and spectroscopic redshift measurements from electromagnetic (EM) observations, we propose a data-driven model-independent method to reconstruct deviations in the variation of the effective Planck mass (in conjunction with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this multi-messenger technique, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift (z), with a precision ranging from approximately $2.4\%$ to $7.2\%$ from redshift $z=1$ to $z=6$ with a single event. Additionally, we achieved a measurement of the Hubble constant with a precision of about $1.3\%$, accounting for variations in the effective Planck mass over 4 years of observation time ($T_{\mathrm{obs}}$). This assumes that EM counterparts are detected for $75\%$ of the events. This precision improves with observation time as $T_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1/2}$. This approach not only has the potential to reveal deviations from General Relativity but also to significantly expand our understanding of the universe's fundamental physical properties.</description>

      <title>Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by PLANCK and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum (AM) of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the surrounding mass distribution. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown collapse time such ellipsoidal patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only, so it does not allow one to infer from it the AM of relaxed haloes. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo AM. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism, fixing all the open issues of the protohalo AM in the peak theory. That viewpoint is fully accomplished in the sense that not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also identified to a peak or a hole. This way, we obtain a simple analytic expression for the mean and median Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Derivative Coupling Cosmology and the Speed of Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called Nonminimal Derivative Coupling (NDC) is an alternative to General Relativity, which produces an asymptotic inflationary mechanism when applied to cosmology. The detection of gravitational waves in the last decade has imposed very stringent constraints over gravitational theories, which gave rise to a massive revision of those theories, in order to investigate the compatibility between them and that observational data. In this paper, we review NDC and address the question if it is compatible with gravitational waves or not. We show that the very existence of gravitational waves in this theory is restricted to a limited range in phase space and there are no accelerated solutions compatible with the present day data for the speed of such waves. This last result is alleviated by the fact that we did not detect primordial gravitational waves so far. Those conclusions are based on the comparison between the expression for the speed of tensor perturbations and the phase space. Finally, some possible scenarios and solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Axion Clouds around Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that axions can be efficiently produced via non-stationary pair plasma discharges in the polar cap region of pulsars. Here, we point out that for axion masses $10^{-9} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-4} \, \rm eV$, a sizable fraction of the sourced axion population will be gravitationally confined to the neutron star. These axions accumulate over astrophysical timescales, thereby forming a dense `axion cloud' around the star. We argue that the existence of such a cloud, with densities reaching and potentially exceeding $\mathcal{O}(10^{22}) \, {\rm GeV \, cm^{-3}}$, is a generic expectation across a wide range of parameter space. For axion masses $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-7} \, \rm eV$, energy is primarily radiated from the axion cloud via resonant axion-photon mixing, generating a number of distinctive signatures that include: a sharp line in the radio spectrum of each pulsar (located at the axion mass, and with an order percent-level width), and transient events arising from the reconfiguration of charge densities in the magnetosphere. While a deeper understanding of the systematic uncertainties in these systems is required, our current estimates suggest that existing radio telescopes could improve sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The minimal $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry extended Standard Model (SM) is a well motivated framework that resolves the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and experimental observation of muon anomalous magnetic moment. We envisage the possibility of identifying the beyond Standard Model Higgs of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ sector, non-minimally coupled to gravity, as the inflaton in the early universe, while being consistent with the $(g-2)_\mu$ data. Although the structure seems to be trivial, we observe that taking into consideration of a complete cosmological history starting from inflation through the reheating phase to late-time epoch along with existing constraints on $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model parameters leave us a small window of allowed reheating temperature. This further results into restriction of $(n_s-r)$ plane which is far severe than the one in a generic non-minimal quartic inflationary set up.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe in searches for dark matter. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detector's hardware. In this work, we explore the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with the LIGO detectors. We analyze domain walls consisting of dark matter passing through the Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with light in the interferometer, and with the beam splitter, we perform the first analysis of topological dark matter with gravitational-wave strain data. We examine whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain-wall passages. We find that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyze favor the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain-wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover, we find that some topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we find that special types of glitches in the measurement data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide future searches and analyses.</description>

Abstract: The axion, as a leading dark matter candidate, is the target of many ongoing and proposed experimental searches based on its coupling to photons. Ultralight axions that couple to photons can also cause polarization rotation of light, which the cosmic microwave background can probe. In this work, we show that a large axion field is inevitably developed around supermassive black holes due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of axions, enhancing the induced birefringence effects. Therefore, measuring the modulations of supermassive black hole imaging polarization angles is a strong probe of the axion-photon coupling due to the formation of the axion condensation (axion star) which enhances the axion field. The oscillating axion field around black holes induces polarization rotation on the black hole image, which is detectable and distinguishable from astrophysical effects on the polarization angle, as it exhibits distinctive temporal variability and frequency invariability. In this work, we perform theoretical calculations of the axion star formation rate and the corresponding enhanced axion field value near supermassive black holes. Then, we present the range of axion-photon couplings within the axion mass range $10^{-21}-10^{-16}\,\text{eV}$ that can be probed by the Event Horizon Telescope. The axion parameter space probed by black hole polarimetry will expand with improvements in sensitivity of polarization measurements and more black hole polarimetry targets with determined black hole masses.</description>

      <title>Walls, bubbles and doom -- the cosmology of HEFT</title>

Abstract: As experiment charts new territory at the electroweak scale, the enterprise to characterise all possible theories becomes all the more necessary. In the absence of new particles, this ambitious enterprise is attainable and has led to the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) as the most general characterising framework, containing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a subspace. The characterisation of this theory space led to the dichotomy SMEFT vs. HEFT\SMEFT as the two possible realisations of symmetry breaking. The criterion to distinguish these two possibilities is non-local in field space, and phenomena which explore field space beyond the neighbourhood of the vacuum manifold are in a singular position to tell them apart. Cosmology allows for such phenomena, and this work focuses on HEFT\SMEFT, the less explored of the two options, to find that first order phase transitions with detectable gravitational wave remnants, domain wall formation and vacuum decay in the far, far distant future can take place and single out HEFT\SMEFT. Results in cosmology are put against LHC constraints, and the potential of future ground- and space-based experiments to cover parameter space is discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis in the presence of helical hypermagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in particle physics and cosmology is understanding why there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is thermal leptogenesis, which involves the addition of at least two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to the standard model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the hypermagnetic fields which involves the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical hypermagnetic fields in the early Universe. In this paper, after reviewing the thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we investigate the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore the parameter space for optimal results. Our results show that the combined scenario permits a specific region of parameter space that is not covered by either one separately. In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and strength of initial hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of magnitude in our model. Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario, leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either amplify or reduce the effect of each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry, depending on the sign of the helical hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the surprising result that a drastic amplification can occur even when the initial abundance of RHN is its equilibrium value for leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the clustering of quasars and galaxies at $z\approx6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at $z\approx6$. The auto-correlation function of faint $z\approx6$ quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at $z\approx2-4$. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of $z\approx6$ quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in $\approx10^{12.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ halos (corresponding to $\approx5\sigma$ fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low ($\approx1\%$); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos ($\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of $\approx13\%$. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at $z\approx2-6$, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Bulk Neutrinos in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and quantum gravity are strong reasons to extend the standard model of particle physics. A large extra dimension can be motivated by quantum gravity and can explain the small neutrino masses with new singlet states that propagate in the bulk. In such a case, a Kaluza-Klein tower of sterile neutrinos emerges. We revisit constraints on towers of sterile neutrinos that come from cosmological observables such as the effective number of noninteracting relativistic species and the dark matter density. These limits generically rule out micron-sized extra dimensions. We explore the weakening of these constraints to accommodate an extra dimension close to the micron size by assuming that the universe reheated after inflation to a low temperature. We discuss how such a possibility can be distinguished in the event of a positive signal in a cosmological observable.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime: loops, dimensional regularization and cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalar fields in de Sitter spacetime, computed via standard perturbation theory, often exhibit secular growth characterized by time-dependent divergent terms in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing cosmic expansion. It is widely believed that loop corrections further enhance this secular growth. However, in this note, we argue that this is not necessarily the case: Loop corrections can be systematically handled using standard perturbative techniques, such as dimensional regularization, without introducing new $\ln a(t)$ terms. We focus on a canonical massless scalar field $\varphi$ with self-interactions described by a potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, and analyze correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this framework, infrared divergences can be systematically eliminated with counterterms at each order in perturbation theory, leading to loop-corrected correlation functions that are indistinguishable from their tree-level forms, with no secular growth from loops. Furthermore, adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we explore the role of cutoffs in computing loop corrections within effective field theory and identify the effective potential $\mathcal{V}_{\rm eff}(\varphi)$, which guarantees cutoff-independent observables. We conclude that when infrared comoving cutoffs are used to regularize loop integrals, time-dependent Wilsonian coefficients are necessary to maintain cutoff-free correlation functions. Neglecting this time dependence results in secular growth from loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion irrespectively of the type of metric. The general solutions of evolution equations in the spatially flat FLRW metric have been found for models with the quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Magnetising galaxies with cold inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z\sim2-3$) galaxies accrete circumgalactic gas through cold streams. Recent high-resolution MHD simulations of these streams showed a significant amplification of the intergalactic magnetic field in the shear layer around them. In this work we estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift galaxies that would result purely due to the accretion of already magnetised gas from cold streams. We use the mass inflow rates and saturated magnetic field values from cold stream simulations as input to a simple analytic model that calculates the galactic magnetic field purely from mass accretion. Our model predicts average magnetic field strengths that exceed $\rm\mu G$ values at $z\sim 2-3$ for inflow rates above $0.1 \, \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. For high inflow rates, our model results are consistent with the recent detection of a strong magnetic field in $z\gtrsim 2.6$ galaxies. Within the assumptions of our simple model, magnetised cold streams emerge as a viable mechanism for seeding a dynamically important galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Plausible constraints and inflationary production for dark photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>
