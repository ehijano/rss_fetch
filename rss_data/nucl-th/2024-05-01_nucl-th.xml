      <title>Statistical Theory of Neutron-Induced Nuclear Fission and of Heavy-Ion Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For both reactions we use an approach similar to that of compound-nucleus reaction theory. For neutron-induced fission, we describe the compound system generated by absorption of the neutron and the nuclear system near the scission point as two statistically independent systems governed by random-matrix theory. The systems are connected either by a barrier penetration factor or by a set of transition states above the barrier. Each system is coupled to a different set of channels. An analogous model is used for heavy-ion fusion. Assuming that (seen from the entrance channel) the system on the other side of the barrier is in the regime of strongly overlapping resonances, we obtain for fixed spin and parity closed-form analytical expressions for the total probability for fission and for fusion. Parts of these expressions can be calculated reliably within existing compound-nucleus reaction theory. The remaining parts are the probabilities for passage through or over the barrier. These may be determined theoretically from the liquid-drop model or experimentally from total fission or fusion cross sections.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential of synthesizing unknown superheavy isotopes via cold-fusion reactions based on the dinuclear system model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To assess the potential of cold-fusion for synthesizing superheavy nuclei (SHN) with proton numbers 104-113, we systematically calculated 145 naturally occurring projectile-target combinations within the DNS model. Reactions predominantly show maximum cross-sections in the 1n to 2n channels, peaking near the Coulomb barrier with a sum of barrier and Q-value within 30 MeV. The maximum cross-section occurs below the Bass barrier, suggesting either the Bass model's limitation or significant deformation reducing the effective Coulomb barrier. Our calculations align well with experimental data, revealing that more neutron-rich projectiles slightly enhance fusion, though the effect is minor. For fixed targets (Pb, Bi), evaporation residue cross-sections decrease linearly with increasing projectile proton number, attributed to reduced fusion probability and lower fission barriers in heavier SHN. The touching potential $V_{\rm in}$ shows a linear trend with the product of projectile-target proton numbers, with neutron-rich systems exhibiting lower $V_{\rm in}$. Some reactions with $V_{\rm in} &lt; V_{\rm S}$ may involve nucleon transfer before capture. Based on the DNS model, we identified optimal combinations and collision energies for synthesizing SHN with significant cross-sections. Collectively, our findings indicate that cold fusion is a promising avenue for creating proton-rich SHN around the drip line in the Z=104-113 region, offering distinct advantages over alternative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Axion Searches Go Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a few micro-seconds up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.</description>

      <title>Strongly vs. weakly coupled in-medium showers: energy stopping in large-$N_f$ QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high-energy particle may develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as hard bremsstrahlung or pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Those works did not quite make for apples-to-apples comparisons: the gluon shower work investigated energy deposition from a gluon-initiated shower, whereas the QED work investigated charge-deposition from an electron-initiated shower. As a first step to tighten up the comparison, this paper investigates energy deposition in the QED case. Along the way, we develop a framework that should be useful in the future to explore whether the very small effect of overlapping splitting in purely gluonic showers is an artifact of having ignored quarks.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and the subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. The verification of CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review.</description>

      <title>Toward the application of large-$N$ deconfinement to SU(3) QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally known for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory at finite temperature that phase transitions are manifested by taking the large-$N$ limit. Since the large-$N$ theory undergoes two thermodynamic phase transitions, a nontrivial intermediate phase can be realized in addition to the phases classified as the conventional confined and deconfined phases. In this talk, we discuss that a similar picture can be applied to QCD with $N=3$. In particular, we analyze the gauge configurations of lattice QCD calculations involving dynamical quarks and show the results of an analysis of the deviation due to finite-temperature effects from the Haar randomness expected at zero temperature in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory, using physical pictures suggested by the large-$N$ theory.</description>

      <title>The Width of an Electron-Capture Neutrino Wave Packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on the methodology outlined in previous work that predicted the width of an antineutrino wave packet emerging from a beta-decaying nucleus, to the case of a neutrino from electron capture decay. Based on this result, we also respond to a recent Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions Experiment (BeEST) paper which utilizes this previous work in forming their measurement of the neutrino wave packet width. According to our interpretation, the direct limit on the neutrino wave packet width from electron capture decay ($e^- + \mathrm{^{7}Be}\rightarrow\mathrm{^{7}Li+\nu_e}$) using the BeEST analysis should map to $\sigma_{\nu,x}&gt;6.2\,\mathrm{pm}$ while our theoretical prediction is $\sigma_{\nu,x}\sim2.7\,\mathrm{nm}$.</description>

      <title>Universality for Three Bosons with Large, Negative Effective Range: Aspects and Addenda</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resummed-Range Effective Field Theory is the consistent non-relativistic Effective Field Theory of point interactions in systems with large two-body scattering length $a$ and an effective range $r_0$ large in magnitude but negative. Its leading order is non-perturbative, and its observables depend only on the dimensionless ratio $\xi:=2r_0/a$ once $|r_0|$ is chosen as base unit. This presentation highlights aspects for three identical spinless bosons and adds details to a previous discussion [1]. At leading order, no three-body interaction is needed. A ground state exists only in the range $0.366\ldots\ge\xi\ge-8.72\ldots$, and excited states display self-similarity and Discrete Scale Invariance, with small corrections for nonzero $r_0$.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Systematic Trends in Nuclear Data with Generative Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for studying systematic trends in nuclear reaction data using generative adversarial networks. Libraries of nuclear cross section evaluations exhibit intricate systematic trends across the nuclear landscape, and predictive models capable of reproducing and analyzing these trends are valuable for many applications. We have developed a predictive model using deep generative adversarial networks to learn trends from the inelastic neutron scattering channel of TENDL for even-even nuclei. The system predicts cross sections based on adding/subtracting particles to/from the target nucleus. It can thus help identify cross sections that break from expected trends and predict beyond the limit of current experiments. Our model can produce good predictions for cross section curves for many nuclides, and it is most robust near the line of stability. We also create an ensemble of predictions to leverage different correlations and estimate model uncertainty. This research marks an important first step in computer generation of nuclear cross-section libraries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and non-relativistic energy-density functionals, for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on thermal transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the picture of partial deconfinement developed in recent years for large-$N$ gauge theories, we propose a new way of analyzing and understanding thermal phase transition in QCD. We find nontrivial support for our proposal by analyzing the WHOT-QCD collaboration's lattice configurations for SU(3) QCD in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions with up, down, and strange quarks.
  We find that the Polyakov line (the holonomy matrix around a thermal time circle) is governed by the Haar-random distribution at low temperatures. The deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures can be measured via the character expansion, or equivalently, via the expectation values of the Polyakov loop defined by the various nontrivial representations of SU(3).
  We find that the Polyakov loop corresponding to the fundamental representation and loops in the higher representation condense at different temperatures. This suggests that there are (at least) three phases, one intermediate phase existing in between the completely-confined and the completely-deconfined phases. Our identification of the intermediate phase is supported also by the condensation of instantons: by studying the instanton numbers of the WHOT-QCD configurations, we find that the instanton condensation occurs for temperature regimes corresponding to what we identify as the completely-confined and intermediate phases, whereas the instantons do not condense in the completely-deconfined phase.
  Our characterization of confinement based on the Haar-randomness explains why the Polyakov loop is a good observable to distinguish the confinement and the deconfinement phases in QCD despite the absence of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ center symmetry.</description>

      <title>Mass and radius of the most massive neutron star: The probe of the equation of state and perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, an association of GW190425 and FRB 20190425A had been claimed and a highly magnetized neutron star (NS) remnant was speculated. Given the $\sim 2.5$-h delay of the occurrence of FRB 20190425A, a uniformly rotating supramassive magnetar is favored since the differential rotation would have been promptly terminated by the magnetic braking. The required maximum gravitational mass ($M_{\rm TOV}$) of the nonrotating NS is $\approx 2.77M_\odot$, which is strongly in tension with the relatively low $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.25M_\odot$ obtained in current equation of state (EOS) constraints incorporating perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) information. However, the current mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability measurements of NSs alone do not convincingly exclude the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ possibility. By performing EOS constraints with mock measurements, we find that with a $2\%$ determination for the radius of PSR J0740+6620-like NS it is possible to distinguish between the low and high $M_{\rm TOV}$ scenarios. We further explore the prospect to resolve the issue of the appropriate density to impose the pQCD constraints with future massive NS observations or determinations of $M_{\rm TOV}$ and/or $R_{\rm TOV}$. It turns out that measuring the radius of a PSR J0740+6620-like NS is insufficient to probe the EOSs around 5 nuclear saturation density, where the information from pQCD becomes relevant. The additional precise $M_{\rm TOV}$ measurements anyhow could provide insights into the EOS at such a density. Indeed, supposing the central engine of GRB 170817A is a black hole formed via the collapse of a supramassive NS, the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.2M_\odot$ considerably softens the EOS at the center of the most massive NS, which is in favor of imposing the pQCD constraint at density beyond the one achievable in the NSs.</description>

      <title>Extracting transition generalized parton distributions from hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the extraction of transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from production of two back-to-back high transverse momentum photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and a massive pair of leptons ($\ell^+\ell^-$) in hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering. We argue that the exclusive scattering amplitude of both processes could be factorized into nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude and nucleon transition GPDs that are convoluted with perturbatively calculable short-distance matching coefficients. We demonstrate that the exclusive diphoton production not only is complementary to the Drell-Yan-type dilepton production for extracting the GPDs, but also provides enhanced sensitivities for extracting the parton momentum fraction $x$ dependence of the GPDs. We show that both exclusive observables are physically measurable at the J-PARC and AMBER experiment energies. If the target nucleon can be polarized, corresponding spin asymmetries can offer additional sensitivities for extracting transition GPDs.</description>
