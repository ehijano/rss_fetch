      <title>New systems of log-canonical coordinates on $SL(2)$ character varieties of compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new sets of log-canonical coordinates on $SL(2)$ character varieties of unpunctured Riemann surfaces. These coordinates are obtained by combining the shear coordinates with length-twist type coordinates of Fenchel-Nielsen type and their extensions in complex domain.</description>

      <title>The strong Viterbo conjecture and various flavours of duality in Lagrangian products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we analyze normalized symplectic capacities for two different notions of duality in Lagrangian products. Let $\Phi$ be a $n$-tuple of Young functions with Legendre transform $n$-tuple $\Phi^*$ and $K_{\Phi}$ the unit ball for the Luxemburg metric induced by $\Phi$. We can consider the ``dual functional" Lagrangian product $K_{\Phi}\times_LK_{\Phi^*}$ and the usual polar dual Lagrangian product $K_{\Phi}\times_L K_{\Phi}^{\circ}$. We show that for the former, all normalized symplectic capacities agree, while for the latter, we give a lower bound depending on $\Phi$. In particular, under certain conditions on the $n$-tuple $\Phi$, we get that $c(K_{\Phi}\times_L K_{\Phi}^{\circ})=4$, for any normalized symplectic capacity, that is, the strong Viterbo conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and flexibility in $p$-adic symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer and let $p$ be a prime number. We prove that the analog of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem does not hold for $p$-adic embeddings: for any $p$-adic absolute value $R$, the entire $p$-adic space $(\mathbb{Q}_p)^{2n}$ is symplectomorphic to the $p$-adic cylinder $\mathrm{Z}_p^{2n}(R)$ of radius $R$, showing a degree of flexibility which stands in contrast with the real case. However, some rigidity remains: we prove that the $p$-adic affine analog of Gromov's result still holds. We will also show that in the non-linear situation, if the $p$-adic embeddings are equivariant with respect to a torus action, then non-squeezing holds, which generalizes a recent result by Figalli, Palmer and the second author. This allows us to introduce equivariant $p$-adic analytic symplectic capacities, of which the $p$-adic equivariant Gromov width is an example.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem along fibers of extreme points of the momentum polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a complex reductive Lie group acting on a compact K\"ahler manifold X and assume that the action of a maximal compact subgroup K of G is Hamiltonian. For each extreme point of the convex hull of the momentum map image, there is an associated open dense subset of X, which is invariant under a parabolic subgroup Q of G. We prove a Q-equivariant product decomposition for the Q-action on this subset and discuss some applications of the result. We show a similar statement for real reductive subgroups of G for the restricted momentum map.</description>

      <title>Nakai-Moishezon criteria and the toric Thomas-Yau conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Lagrangian sections $L$ contained in certain Calabi-Yau Lagrangian fibrations (mirrors of toric weak Fano manifolds). We prove that a form of the Thomas-Yau conjecture holds in this case: $L$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in this class if and only if a stability condition holds, in the sense of a slope inequality on objects in a set of exact triangles in the Fukaya-Seidel category. This agrees with general proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and toric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about supercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the Nakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a toric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the Fukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds in the example given by the blowup of the projective plane at a point. This is consistent with general conjectures due to Joyce. We discuss some generalisations, including a weaker analogue of our main result for general projective toric manifolds, and a similar obstruction, related to Lagrangian multi-sections, in a special case.</description>

      <title>Almost toric fibrations on K3 surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For K\"ahler K3 surfaces we consider Kulikov models of type III tamed by a symplectic form. Our main result shows that the generic smooth fiber admits an almost toric fibration over the intersection complex, which inherits a natural nodal integral affine structure from almost toric fibrations of the boundary divisors. We prove that a smooth anti-canonical hypersurface in a smooth toric Fano threefold, equipped with a toric K\"ahler form, admits a symplectic Kulikov model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the induced integral affine structure on the intersection complex is integral affine isomorphic (up to nodal slides) nodal integral affine structure considered by Gross and Siebert on the boundary of the moment polytope.</description>

      <title>Foliation de Rham cohomology of generic Reeb foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there exists a residual subset of contact forms $\lambda$ (if any) on a compact connected orientable manifold $M$ for which the foliation de Rham cohomology of the associated Reeb foliation $F_\lambda$ is trivial in that both $H^0(F_\lambda,{\mathbb R})$ and $H^1(F_\lambda,{\mathbb R})$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb R$. We also prove the same triviality for a generic choice of contact forms with fixed contact structure $\xi$. For any choice of $\lambda$ from the aforementioned residual subset, this cohomological result can be restated as any of the following two equivalent statements: (1) The functional equation $R_{\lambda}[f] = u$ is uniquely solvable (modulo the addition by constant) for any $u$ satisfying $\int_M u\, d\mu_\lambda =0$, or (2) The Lie algebra of the group of strict contactomorphisms is isomorphic to the span of Reeb vector fields, and so isomorphic to the 1 dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\mathbb R$. This result is also a key ingredient for the proof of the generic scarcity result of strict contactomorphisms by Savelyev and the author.</description>

      <title>Strict contactomorphisms are scarce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of non-projectible contact forms on a given compact manifold $M$ is introduced by the first-named author in [Ohb], the set of which he also shows is a residual subset of the set of (coorientable) contact forms, both in the case with a fixed contact structure and in the case without it. In this paper, we prove that for any non-projectible contact form $\lambda$ the set, denoted by $\text{\rm Cont}^{\text{\rm st}}(M,\lambda)$, consisting of strict contactomorphisms of $\lambda$ is a a countable disjoint union of real lines $\mathbb R$, one for each connected component.</description>

      <title>Quasifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1710.07116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasifolds are singular spaces that generalize manifolds and orbifolds. They are locally modeled by manifolds modulo the smooth action of countable groups and they are typically not Hausdorff. If the countable groups happen to be all finite, then quasifolds are orbifolds and if they happen to be all equal to the identity, they are manifolds. In this article we illustrate quasifolds by describing a two-dimensional example that displays all of their main characteristics: the quasisphere.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>
