      <title>Deviations from Tradition: Stylized Facts in the Era of DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are now a significant component of the financial world where billions of dollars are traded daily. Differently from traditional markets, which are typically based on Limit Order Books, DEXs typically work as Automated Market Makers, and, since the implementation of Uniswap v3, feature concentrated liquidity. By investigating the twenty-four most active pools in Uniswap v3 during 2023 and 2024, we empirically study how this structural change in the organization of the markets modifies the well-studied stylized facts of prices, liquidity, and order flow observed in traditional markets. We find a series of new statistical regularities in the distributions and cross-autocorrelation functions of these variables that we are able to associate either with the market structure (e.g., the execution of orders in blocks) or with the intense activity of Maximal Extractable Value searchers, such as Just-in-Time liquidity providers and sandwich attackers.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Private Equity Accessibility Reimagined with Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PEARL (Private Equity Accessibility Reimagined with Liquidity), an AI-powered framework designed to replicate and decode private equity funds using liquid, cost-effective assets. Relying on previous research methods such as Erik Stafford's single stock selection (Stafford) and Thomson Reuters - Refinitiv's sector approach (TR), our approach incorporates an additional asymmetry to capture the reduced volatility and better performance of private equity funds resulting from sale timing, leverage, and stock improvements through management changes. As a result, our model exhibits a strong correlation with well-established liquid benchmarks such as Stafford and TR, as well as listed private equity firms (Listed PE), while enhancing performance to better align with renowned quarterly private equity benchmarks like Cambridge Associates, Preqin, and Bloomberg Private Equity Fund indices. Empirical findings validate that our two-step approachdecoding liquid daily private equity proxies with a degree of negative return asymmetry outperforms the initial daily proxies and yields performance more consistent with quarterly private equity benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Right Place, Right Time: Market Simulation-based RL for Execution Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Execution algorithms are vital to modern trading, they enable market participants to execute large orders while minimising market impact and transaction costs. As these algorithms grow more sophisticated, optimising them becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for discovering optimal execution strategies, evaluated within a reactive agent-based market simulator. This simulator creates reactive order flow and allows us to decompose slippage into its constituent components: market impact and execution risk. We assess the RL agent's performance using the efficient frontier based on work by Almgren and Chriss, measuring its ability to balance risk and cost. Results show that the RL-derived strategies consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier, demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact. These findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the trader's toolkit.</description>

      <title>Understanding Carbon Trade Dynamics: A European Union Emissions Trading System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the worlds largest cap-and-trade carbon market, is central to EU climate policy. This study analyzes its efficiency, price behavior, and market structure from 2010 to 2020. Using an AR-GARCH framework, we find pronounced price clustering and short-term return predictability, with 60.05 percent directional accuracy and a 70.78 percent hit rate within forecast intervals. Network analysis of inter-country transactions shows a concentrated structure dominated by a few registries that control most high-value flows. Country-specific log-log regressions of price on traded quantity reveal heterogeneous and sometimes positive elasticities exceeding unity, implying that trading volumes often rise with prices. These results point to persistent inefficiencies in the EU ETS, including partial predictability, asymmetric market power, and unconventional price-volume relationships, suggesting that while the system contributes to decarbonization, its trading dynamics and price formation remain imperfect.</description>

      <title>TABL-ABM: A Hybrid Framework for Synthetic LOB Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Structure of Trend Premia: When Diversification Hides Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary redundancy in trend premia.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Illiquid Markets: an AI-Powered Replication of Private Equity Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to growing demand for resilient and transparent financial instruments, we introduce a novel framework for replicating private equity (PE) performance using liquid, AI-enhanced strategies. Despite historically delivering robust returns, private equity's inherent illiquidity and lack of transparency raise significant concerns regarding investor trust and systemic stability, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility. Our method uses advanced graphical models to decode liquid PE proxies and incorporates asymmetric risk adjustments that emulate private equity's unique performance dynamics. The result is a liquid, scalable solution that aligns closely with traditional quarterly PE benchmarks like Cambridge Associates and Preqin. This approach enhances portfolio resilience and contributes to the ongoing discourse on safe asset innovation, supporting market stability and investor confidence.</description>

      <title>Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts. This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.</description>
