      <title>M-polynomial Based Mathematical Formulation of the Hyperbolic Sombor Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical values extracted from a graph that indicates its topology are called topological indices. A contemporary and efficient method is to compute a graph's topological indices using the graph polynomial that corresponds to it. This method of identifying degree-based topological indices involves the use of the M-polynomial. Very recently, in 2025, the hyperbolic Sombor index (HSO) was proposed and shows its chemical applicability for octane isomers and the structure sensitivity and abruptness for octane, nonane, and decane isomers, respectively. In this work, we establish the closed derivation formula for the above-mentioned index of a graph based on its M-polynomial. Additionally, we use our proposed derivation formula to calculate the hyperbolic Sombor index of a few standard graphs and chemical families. Moreover, we provide the numerical and graphical representations for the M-polynomial and the computed HSO index of the chemical families.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Tightness of the Pigeonhole Bound for Large-Order Davenport-Schinzel Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the pigeonhole upper bound $\lambda(s,m) \leq \binom{m}{2}(s+1)$ is asymptotically tight whenever $s/\!\sqrt{m} \to \infty$. In particular, $\lambda(s,m) \sim \binom{m}{2}\,s$ in this regime. As corollaries: $\lambda(n,n)/n^3 \to \frac{1}{2}$, resolving the leading constant from the previously known interval $[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}]$; and more generally $\lambda(an,bn) \sim \frac{ab^2}{2}\,n^3$ for any constants $a,b &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>On Graham's rearrangement conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graham conjectured in 1971 that for any prime $p$, any subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p\setminus \{0\}$ admits an ordering $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_{|S|}$ where all partial sums $s_1, s_1+s_2,\dots,s_1+s_2+\dots+s_{|S|}$ are distinct. We prove this conjecture for all subsets $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p\setminus \{0\}$ with $|S|\le p^{1-\alpha}$ and $|S|$ sufficiently large with respect to $\alpha$, for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Combined with earlier results, this gives a complete resolution of Graham's rearrangement conjecture for all sufficiently large primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets I: an Elementary Bound for Directed Cycle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [Combinatorica 1996] proved Younger's Conjecture, which states that, for all directed graphs $D$, there exists a function $f$ such that, if $D$ does not contain $k$ disjoint cycles, then $D$ contains a feedback vertex set, i.e.~a subset of vertices whose deletion renders the graph acyclic, of size bounded by $f(k)$. However, the function obtained by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in their paper is enormous and, in fact, not even elementary. We prove the first elementary upper bound for the function $f$ above, showing it is upper-bounded by a power tower of height 8.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J. ACM 2016], who proved a polynomial bound for the Excluded Grid Theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing paths of well-linked sets (PWS), and show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large PWS, which in turn contains a large fence.
  We believe that the theoretical tools developed in this work may find applications beyond the results above, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J. ACM 2016] did for undirected graphs (see, for example, Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge [Discret. Math. Theor. Comput. Sci. 2022], Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA 2015] and Chuzhoy and Nimavat [arXiv 2019]). Indeed, in a follow-up paper, we apply this framework to improve the bounds of the Directed Grid Theorem.</description>

      <title>Pathwidth of 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bipartite graph $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar graph if it admits a drawing on the plane such that the vertices in $X$ and $Y$ are placed on two parallel lines respectively, edges are drawn as straight-line segments, and every edge involves at most $k$ crossings. Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\"orster, and Schneck [GD 2020; Comput. J., 2024] showed that every 2-layer $k$-planar graph has pathwidth at most $k + 1$. In this paper, we show that this bound is sharp by giving a 2-layer $k$-planar graph with pathwidth $k + 1$ for every $k \geq 0$. This improves their lower bound of $(k+3)/2$.</description>

      <title>Exact and Heuristic Computation of the Scanwidth of Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To measure the tree-likeness of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a new width parameter that considers the directions of the arcs was recently introduced: scanwidth. We present the first algorithm that efficiently computes the exact scanwidth of general DAGs. For DAGs with one root and scanwidth $k$ it runs in $O(k \cdot n^k \cdot m)$ time. The algorithm also functions as an FPT algorithm with complexity $O(2^{4 \ell - 1} \cdot \ell \cdot n + n^2)$ for phylogenetic networks of level-$\ell$, a type of DAG used to depict evolutionary relationships among species. Our algorithm performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of synthetic networks up to 30 reticulations and 100 leaves within 500 seconds. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that obtains an average practical approximation ratio of 1.5 on these networks. While we prove that the scanwidth is bounded from below by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph, experiments suggest that for networks the parameters are close in practice.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions. We extend the bounds established by Liu and Liu [6] for codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in the Lee metric to the more general setting of $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Moreover, we give explicit constructions of function-correcting codes in Lee metric.
  Additionally, we explicitly derive a Plotkin-like bound for linear function-correcting codes in the Lee metric. As the Lee metric coincides with the Hamming metric over the binary field, we demonstrate that our bound naturally reduces to a Plotkin-type bound for function-correcting codes under the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>
