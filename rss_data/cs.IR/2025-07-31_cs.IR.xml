      <title>Intent-Aware Neural Query Reformulation for Behavior-Aligned Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity, intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics, underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs: A Practitioner's Handbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing to the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous semantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID sequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic information and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the benefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques, hyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct comparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an open-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension, slowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and open-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely GRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component swapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically experiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on public benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many overlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact performance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an open-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement. GRID is open-sourced at https://github.com/snap-research/GRID.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Relational Item Representation Learning for Inferring Substitutable and Complementary Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and 39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.</description>

      <title>Sustainability Evaluation Metrics for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability-oriented evaluation metrics can help to assess the quality of recommender systems beyond wide-spread metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and satisfaction. Following the United Nations`s sustainable development goals (SDGs), such metrics can help to analyse the impact of recommender systems on environmental, social, and economic aspects. We discuss different basic sustainability evaluation metrics for recommender systems and analyze their applications.</description>

      <title>GeoOutageKG: A Multimodal Geospatiotemporal Knowledge Graph for Multiresolution Power Outage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.</description>

      <title>RecGPT Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22879v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.</description>

      <title>AUV-Fusion: Cross-Modal Adversarial Fusion of User Interactions and Visual Perturbations Against VARS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Visual-Aware Recommender Systems (VARS) exploit the integration of user interaction data and visual features to deliver personalized recommendations with high precision. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under rigorous scrutiny.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.</description>

      <title>Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.</description>
