      <title>Moving beyond privacy and airspace safety: Guidelines for just drones in policing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of drones offers police forces potential gains in efficiency and safety. However, their use may also harm public perception of the police if drones are refused. Therefore, police forces should consider the perception of bystanders and broader society to maximize drones' potential. This article examines the concerns expressed by members of the public during a field trial involving 52 test participants. Analysis of the group interviews suggests that their worries go beyond airspace safety and privacy, broadly discussed in existing literature and regulations. The interpretation of the results indicates that the perceived justice of drone use is a significant factor in acceptance. Leveraging the concept of organizational justice and data collected, we propose a catalogue of guidelines for just operation of drones to supplement the existing policy. We present the organizational justice perspective as a framework to integrate the concerns of the public and bystanders into legal work. Finally, we discuss the relevance of justice for the legitimacy of the police's actions and provide implications for research and practice.</description>

      <title>Towards the Socio-Algorithmic Construction of Fairness: The Case of Automatic Price-Surging in Ride-Hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms take decisions that affect humans, and have been shown to perpetuate biases and discrimination. Decisions by algorithms are subject to different interpretations. Algorithms' behaviors are basis for the construal of moral assessment and standards. Yet we lack an understanding of how algorithms impact on social construction processes, and vice versa. Without such understanding, social construction processes may be disrupted and, eventually, may impede moral progress in society. We analyze the public discourse that emerged after a significant (five-fold) price-surge following the Brooklyn Subway Shooting on April 12, 2022, in New York City. There was much controversy around the two ride-hailing firms' algorithms' decisions. The discussions evolved around various notions of fairness and the algorithms' decisions' justifiability. Our results indicate that algorithms, even if not explicitly addressed in the discourse, strongly impact on constructing fairness assessments and notions. They initiate the exchange, form people's expectations, evoke people's solidarity with specific groups, and are a vehicle for moral crusading. However, they are also subject to adjustments based on social forces. We claim that the process of constructing notions of fairness is no longer just social; it has become a socio-algorithmic process. We propose a theory of socio-algorithmic construction as a mechanism for establishing notions of fairness and other ethical constructs.</description>

      <title>AI Consciousness and Public Perceptions: Four Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discourse on risks from advanced AI systems ("AIs") typically focuses on misuse, accidents and loss of control, but the question of AIs' moral status could have negative impacts which are of comparable significance and could be realised within similar timeframes. Our paper evaluates these impacts by investigating (1) the factual question of whether future advanced AI systems will be conscious, together with (2) the epistemic question of whether future human society will broadly believe advanced AI systems to be conscious. Assuming binary responses to (1) and (2) gives rise to four possibilities: in the true positive scenario, society predominantly correctly believes that AIs are conscious; in the false positive scenario, that belief is incorrect; in the true negative scenario, society correctly believes that AIs are not conscious; and lastly, in the false negative scenario, society incorrectly believes that AIs are not conscious. The paper offers vivid vignettes of the different futures to ground the two-dimensional framework. Critically, we identify four major risks: AI suffering, human disempowerment, geopolitical instability, and human depravity. We evaluate each risk across the different scenarios and provide an overall qualitative risk assessment for each scenario. Our analysis suggests that the worst possibility is the wrong belief that AI is non-conscious, followed by the wrong belief that AI is conscious. The paper concludes with the main recommendations to avoid research aimed at intentionally creating conscious AI and instead focus efforts on reducing our current uncertainties on both the factual and epistemic questions on AI consciousness.</description>

      <title>Affective Computing in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey from the NLP Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective Computing (AC), integrating computer science, psychology, and cognitive science knowledge, aims to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions.To create more value, AC can be applied to diverse scenarios, including social media, finance, healthcare, education, etc. Affective Computing (AC) includes two mainstream tasks, i.e., Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for AU tasks has succeeded considerably. However, these models lack generalization ability, requiring specialized models for specific tasks. Additionally, traditional PLMs face challenges in AG, particularly in generating diverse and emotionally rich responses. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ChatGPT series and LLaMA models, brings new opportunities and challenges, catalyzing a paradigm shift in AC. LLMs possess capabilities of in-context learning, common sense reasoning, and advanced sequence generation, which present unprecedented opportunities for AU. To provide a comprehensive overview of AC in the LLMs era from an NLP perspective, we summarize the development of LLMs research in this field, aiming to offer new insights. Specifically, we first summarize the traditional tasks related to AC and introduce the preliminary study based on LLMs. Subsequently, we outline the relevant techniques of popular LLMs to improve AC tasks, including Instruction Tuning and Prompt Engineering. For Instruction Tuning, we discuss full parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-Tuning, and Prompt Tuning. In Prompt Engineering, we examine Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Agent-based methods for AU and AG. To clearly understand the performance of LLMs on different Affective Computing tasks, we further summarize the existing benchmarks and evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Advanced LLM Techniques on AI-Lecture Tutors for a Robotics Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Artificial Intelligence-based tutor for a university course. In particular, different advanced techniques are utilized, such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We assessed the different models and applied techniques using common similarity metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE, and BERTScore, complemented by a small human evaluation of helpfulness and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that RAG combined with prompt engineering significantly enhances model responses and produces better factual answers. In the context of education, RAG appears as an ideal technique as it is based on enriching the input of the model with additional information and material which usually is already present for a university course. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research points to both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs in educational settings, suggesting a need for balanced training approaches and advanced evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Conversational AI Powered by Large Language Models Amplifies False Memories in Witness Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of AI on human false memories -- recollections of events that did not occur or deviate from actual occurrences. It explores false memory induction through suggestive questioning in Human-AI interactions, simulating crime witness interviews. Four conditions were tested: control, survey-based, pre-scripted chatbot, and generative chatbot using a large language model (LLM). Participants (N=200) watched a crime video, then interacted with their assigned AI interviewer or survey, answering questions including five misleading ones. False memories were assessed immediately and after one week. Results show the generative chatbot condition significantly increased false memory formation, inducing over 3 times more immediate false memories than the control and 1.7 times more than the survey method. 36.4% of users' responses to the generative chatbot were misled through the interaction. After one week, the number of false memories induced by generative chatbots remained constant. However, confidence in these false memories remained higher than the control after one week. Moderating factors were explored: users who were less familiar with chatbots but more familiar with AI technology, and more interested in crime investigations, were more susceptible to false memories. These findings highlight the potential risks of using advanced AI in sensitive contexts, like police interviews, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserved Taxi Demand Prediction System Utilizing Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate taxi-demand prediction is essential for optimizing taxi operations and enhancing urban transportation services. However, using customers' data in these systems raises significant privacy and security concerns. Traditional federated learning addresses some privacy issues by enabling model training without direct data exchange but often struggles with accuracy due to varying data distributions across different regions or service providers. In this paper, we propose CC-Net: a novel approach using collaborative learning enhanced with contrastive learning for taxi-demand prediction. Our method ensures high performance by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a demand-prediction model through hierarchical federated learning. In this approach, similar parties are clustered together, and federated learning is applied within each cluster. The similarity is defined without data exchange, ensuring privacy and security. We evaluated our approach using real-world data from five taxi service providers in Japan over fourteen months. The results demonstrate that CC-Net maintains the privacy of customers' data while improving prediction accuracy by at least 2.2% compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Information Extraction from Humanitarian Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanitarian action is accompanied by a mass of reports, summaries, news, and other documents. To guide its activities, important information must be quickly extracted from such free-text resources. Quantities, such as the number of people affected, amount of aid distributed, or the extent of infrastructure damage, are central to emergency response and anticipatory action. In this work, we contribute an annotated dataset for the humanitarian domain for the extraction of such quantitative information, along side its important context, including units it refers to, any modifiers, and the relevant event. Further, we develop a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract the quantities alongside their units, and evaluate it in comparison to baseline and recent literature. The proposed model achieves a consistent improvement in the performance, especially in the documents pertaining to the Dominican Republic and select African countries. We make the dataset and code available to the research community to continue the improvement of NLP tools for the humanitarian domain.</description>

      <title>Examining the Behavior of LLM Architectures Within the Framework of Standardized National Exams in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Exame Nacional do Ensino M\'edio (ENEM) is a pivotal test for Brazilian students, required for admission to a significant number of universities in Brazil. The test consists of four objective high-school level tests on Math, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Languages, and one writing essay. Students' answers to the test and to the accompanying socioeconomic status questionnaire are made public every year (albeit anonymized) due to transparency policies from the Brazilian Government. In the context of large language models (LLMs), these data lend themselves nicely to comparing different groups of humans with AI, as we can have access to human and machine answer distributions. We leverage these characteristics of the ENEM dataset and compare GPT-3.5 and 4, and MariTalk, a model trained using Portuguese data, to humans, aiming to ascertain how their answers relate to real societal groups and what that may reveal about the model biases. We divide the human groups by using socioeconomic status (SES), and compare their answer distribution with LLMs for each question and for the essay. We find no significant biases when comparing LLM performance to humans on the multiple-choice Brazilian Portuguese tests, as the distance between model and human answers is mostly determined by the human accuracy. A similar conclusion is found by looking at the generated text as, when analyzing the essays, we observe that human and LLM essays differ in a few key factors, one being the choice of words where model essays were easily separable from human ones. The texts also differ syntactically, with LLM generated essays exhibiting, on average, smaller sentences and less thought units, among other differences. These results suggest that, for Brazilian Portuguese in the ENEM context, LLM outputs represent no group of humans, being significantly different from the answers from Brazilian students across all tests.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the capability of large language models to personalize science texts for diverse middle-school-age learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series, have made significant advancements in recent years. Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Indian-BhED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame through Indian-BhED, a first of its kind dataset, containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples in the context of caste and religious stereotypes in India. We find that the majority of LLMs tested have a strong propensity to output stereotypes in the Indian context, especially when compared to axes of bias traditionally studied in the Western context, such as gender and race. Notably, we find that GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, and GPT 3.5 have a particularly high propensity for preferring stereotypical outputs as a percent of all sentences for the axes of caste (63-79%) and religion (69-72%). We finally investigate potential causes for such harmful behaviour in LLMs, and posit intervention techniques to reduce both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when researching fairness in AI and evaluating LLMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond prompt brittleness: Evaluating the reliability and consistency of political worldviews in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), we need to understand whether they embed a specific "worldview" and what these views reflect. Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy issues. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They show a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare state and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in the areas of foreign policy and migration.</description>

      <title>Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment through Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard and Soft Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have proven to be effective in enhancing the quality of life and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation, which allows patients to independently complete exercises at home, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze exercise data, providing feedback to patients and updating clinicians on their progress. These programs commonly prescribe a variety of exercise types, leading to a distinct challenge in rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets: while abundant in overall training samples, these datasets often have a limited number of samples for each individual exercise type. This disparity hampers the ability of existing approaches to train generalizable models with such a small sample size per exercise type. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel supervised contrastive learning framework with hard and soft negative samples that effectively utilizes the entire dataset to train a single model applicable to all exercise types. This model, with a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture, demonstrated enhanced generalizability across exercises and a decrease in overall complexity. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, UI-PRMD, IRDS, and KIMORE, our method has proven to surpass existing methods, setting a new benchmark in rehabilitation exercise quality assessment.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, interpret constitutional principles in complex decision-making scenarios. We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.</description>
