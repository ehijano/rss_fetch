      <title>The Discovery of Giant Positive Magnetoresistance in Proximity to Helimagnetic Order in Manganese Phosphide Nanostructured Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of magnetoresistance (MR) phenomena has been pivotal in advancing magnetic sensors and spintronic devices. Helimagnets present an intriguing avenue for spintronics research. Theoretical predictions suggest that MR magnitude in the helimagnetic (HM) regime surpasses that in the ferromagnetic (FM) regime by over an order of magnitude. However, in metallic helimagnets like manganese phosphide, MR in the HM phase remains modest (10%), limiting its application in MR devices. Here, a groundbreaking approach is presented to achieve a giant low field MR effect in nanostructured manganese phosphide films by leveraging confinement and strain effects along with spin helicity. Unlike the modest MR observed in bulk manganese phosphide single crystals and large grain polycrystalline films, which exhibit a small negative MR in the FM region (2%) increasing to 8% in the HM region across 10-300 K, a grain size-dependent giant positive MR (90%) is discovered near FM to HM transition temperature (110 K), followed by a rapid decline to a negative MR below 55 K in manganese phosphide nanocrystalline films. These findings illuminate a novel strain-mediated spin helicity phenomenon in nanostructured helimagnets, presenting a promising pathway for the development of high-performance MR sensors and spintronic devices through the strategic utilization of confinement and strain effects.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of non-insulated DEMO TF coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of small solenoids without/with-partial insulation among turns or layers has been proven to grant higher thermal stability than for standard insulated cases. This technology implies higher safety standards, by allowing for 1-100 V highest voltage in the single TF coil; at the same time, a passive/simpler quench protection systems (QPS) becomes a concrete opportunity. Besides, experiments and simulations on large-scale solenoids do not guarantee yet the same advantages, as the redistribution of currents after quench is not yet clear and the temperature margins allowed by LTS are narrower. The possibility for full internal energy dissipation is here discussed analytically, highlighting the already high final temperatures being reached and the limits of the held hypotheses. \\ This study presents therefore a new effective 3-D original numerical model, developed for simulating in a fast fashion charge/discharge and quench of a EUROfusion DEMO toroidal field (TF) coil, by coupling both electrical and thermal physics in the same solver. Its structure is explained as well as its first benchmarks. Finally, the first results are reported of a parametric study where only turn-turn localized bridges are considered, discussing the consequences and the future outlook for this simulation work.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model For The Contribution Of Small Scatterers to Open-Ended Coaxial Probe Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open-ended coaxial probe (OECP) technique is one of the most commonly used methods for the characterization of homogeneous media properties, especially in the biomedical sciences. However, when considering inhomogeneous media, the effect of the heterogeneity on the probe terminal admittance is unclear, making the measured admittance hard to interpret and relate to the medium properties. In this paper we present an analytical model for the contribution of an isotropic scatterer embedded in an otherwise homogeneous medium to the probe admittance. We utilize rigorous scattering theory and various approximations to obtain simplified, closed-form expressions. Using the obtained results we present a method to accurately extract the scatterer properties from a measurement of the admittance. In addition, we define the sensing depth, and show how it can be mapped as a function of the expected scatterer properties. Full-wave simulations are used to verify the analytical model, and the proposed method paves a path for further generalization to additional scenarios of open-coaxial probe sensing of an inhomogeneous medium.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of shear horizontal (SH) acoustic waves in a quartz elastic plate in contact with a viscous fluid layer of a finite thickness as an acoustic wave sensor for measuring fluid viscosity or density. The first order elastic plate theory by Mindlin and the theory of Newtonian fluids are used. An equation for determining the dispersion relations of the SH waves is obtained. Approximate dispersion relations for long waves are given analytically. Numerical results showing the effects of the fluid on SH wave characteristics are presented.</description>

      <title>Processes and characteristics of methane hydrate formation and decomposition: a microfluidic experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and decomposition of methane hydrates, particularly in porous media such as subsea sediments, have attracted significant research interest due to their implications for energy production, storage, and safety in deep-sea environments. This study explores the process and characteristics of methane hydrates formation and decomposition using microfluidic technology to mimic natural conditions. By incorporating methylene blue, we enhanced phase differentiation, identifying five hydrate types: block, vein, point, membrane, and shell. These forms were influenced by the presence and movement of free gas, which shaped their development. Block and vein hydrates mainly formed in water-filled pores, while point and membrane hydrates appeared as coatings related to gas migration. Shell hydrates formed after gas relocation, filling pores. During dissociation, the presence of free gas accelerated the process significantly, with a dissociation rate approximately 12 times faster than with water alone. Gas migration was key in accelerating hydrate breakdown and fragment formation. This research offers critical insights into methane hydrate behavior, aiding in optimizing natural gas extraction and preventing deep-sea pipeline blockages.</description>

      <title>Phase equilibria, volumetric properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of hydrogen binary mixtures containing methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TThis works proposes modifications to the values of input parameters in widely accepted semi-analytical models of thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and its binary mixtures to improve their prediction accuracy. The modifications include characterization parameters for the Peng and Robinson Equation of State (PR-EoS), the Jossi-Stiel-Thodos (JST)/Lohrenz-Bray-Clark (LBC) viscosity correlation, and the Chung-Lee-Starling (CLS) thermal conductivity correlation, applicable to pure hydrogen and its binary mixtures containing methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The changes preserve the mathematical structure of the models and ensure their compatibility with existing commercial packages. We consider temperatures ranging from 90 K (triple point of methane) to 1000 K, and pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 100 MPa. The revised characterization parameters of hydrogen lead to a reduction in the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD) of the PR-EoS calculation for hydrogen density from 2.76% (with a maximum of 8.05%) down to 0.182% (with a maximum of 1.9%). For the JST/LBC viscosity correlation, the AAD decreases from 11.82% (with a maximum of 54.3%) to 4.08% (with a maximum of 13%). Regarding thermal conductivity, the adjustments for the CLS correlation results in the AAD decreasing from 36% (with a maximum of 44%) to 2.14\% (with a maximum of 12.1%). Binary interaction parameters for gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen and phase equilibria calculation are also proposed. Finally, we investigage optimal mixing rules parameters for viscosity and thermal conductivity of mixtures for more accurate predictions of mixtures? transport properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Beamforming Optimization for Quantized Phase-only Massive MIMO Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative quantum-inspired method for beamforming (BF) optimization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays. The method leverages the simulated bifurcation (SB) algorithm to address the complex combinatorial optimization problem due to the quantized phase configuration. We propose novel encoding techniques for high-bit phase quantization, which are then mapped into Ising spins. This enables efficient construction of the Hamiltonians and subsequent optimization of BF patterns. The results clearly demonstrate that the SB optimizer surpasses traditional schemes such as digital BF, holographic algorithms and genetic algorithms, offering faster convergence and higher solution quality. The impressive capability of the SB optimizer to handle complex BF scenarios, including sidelobe suppression and multiple beams with nulls, is undoubtedly demonstrated through several application cases. These findings strongly suggest that quantum-inspired methods have great potential to advance MIMO techniques in next-generation wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-driven nonreciprocity for energy guiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an intriguing physical phenomenon, in which all eigen-modes of a non-Hermitian lattice become localized at boundary regions. While such an exotic behavior has been demonstrated in various physical platforms, these realizations have been so far restricted to the linear regime. Here, we explore the interplay between nonlinearity and the non-Hermitian skin effect which can lead to extraordinary amplitude-driven skin localization dynamics that are unfeasible in linear systems. We show that nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can exhibit new kinds of non-Hermitian skin modes, capable of concentrating the energy of a source at any point of space, depending on the power level. This allows the realization of an energy guide that adapts spontaneously to the amount of energy previously stored in the system: it transfers the energy stored in bulk modes to a point only after a sufficient level of energy has been accumulated. Our theoretical, numerical and experimental findings open up exciting paths for a new generation of non-reciprocal systems, in which nonlinearities serve as a strategic tuning knob to manipulate the guiding process.</description>

      <title>External quantum efficiency above 100% in photovoltaic cells due to the technique raising efficiencies for all kinds of solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A V-shaped module (VSM) photovoltaic technique, which breaks traditional concepts, has been proven by European and American scientists to enable power-conversion-efficiency to increase by 50% for thin-film solar cells. Furthermore, the VSM technique raises power-conversion-efficiency for all kinds of solar cells (J. Environ. Sci. Eng. A 12, 214 (2023). https://doi.org/10.17265/2162-5298/2023.06.002). Mysterious dark energy is thought to result in the surprising VSM effect. The VSM approach opens up new avenues to study photovoltaic physics. In this study, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells in the VSM was investigated, which exhibits a surprising phenomenon of EQE above 100%. In theory, non-infrared light incident into a solar cell can cause infrared emission. The VSM could trap the emitted infrared photons and lead to extra photoexcited carriers. The easy-to-reproduce VSM effect is thus explainable. The energy of emitted infrared photons is considered as the so-called dark energy. This study provides new clues and evidences to unravel the mystery of the surprising VSM effect. The VSM technique could also be used to develop photodetectors for infrared and ultraviolet light respectively.</description>

      <title>Development of a Machine Learning based Radio source localisation algorithm for Tri-axial antenna configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the origin of radio emissions is essential for numerous scientific experiments, particularly in radio astronomy. Conventional techniques, such as the use of antenna arrays encounter significant challenges, specially at very low frequencies, due to factors like the substantial size of the antennas and ionospheric interference. To address these challenges, we employ a space-based single-telescope that utilizes co-located antennas, complemented by goniopolarimetric techniques for precise source localization. This study explores a novel and elementary machine learning (ML) technique as a way to improve and estimate Direction of Arrival (DoA), leveraging a tri-axial antenna arrangement for radio source localization. Employing a simplistic emission and receiving antenna model, our study involves training an artificial neural network (ANN) using synthetic radio signals. These synthetic signals can originate from any location in the sky and cover an incoherent frequency range of 0.3 to 30 MHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 0 and 60 dB. Then, a large data set was generated to train the ANN model catering to the possible signal configurations and variations. After training, the developed ANN model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving loss levels in the training ($\sim0.02$), validation ($\sim0.23\%$), and testing ($\sim0.21\%$) phases. The machine learning-based approach remarkably, exhibits substantially quicker inference times ($\sim5$ ms) in contrast to analytically derived Direction of Arrival (DoA) methods, which typically range from 100 ms to a few seconds. This underscores its practicality for real-time applications in radio source localization, particularly in scenarios with limited number of sensors.</description>

      <title>All-optical autoencoder machine learning framework using diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), known for its high speed, low power consumption, and strong parallelism, has been widely applied across various fields, including pattern recognition, image processing, and image transmission. However, existing network architectures primarily focus on data representation within the original domain, with limited exploration of the latent space, thereby restricting the information mining capabilities and multifunctional integration of D2NNs. Here, we propose an all-optical autoencoder (OAE) framework that can encode the input wavefield into a prior shape distribution in the latent space and decode the encoded pattern back to the original wavefield. By leveraging the non-reciprocal property of D2NN, the OAE models function as encoders in one direction of wave propagation and as decoders in the opposite direction. We further apply the models to three key areas: image denoising, noise-resistant reconfigurable image classification, and image generation. Proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted to validate numerical simulations. Our OAE framework fully exploits the potential of latent space representations, enabling a single set of diffractive processors to simultaneously achieve image reconstruction, representation, and generation. It can be viewed as both a counterpart and an extension of the electronic autoencoder model. This work not only offers fresh insights into the design of optical generative models but also paves the way for developing and applying multifunctional, highly integrated, and general optical intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Lateral diffusion in 2-micron InGaAs/GaAsSb superlattice planar diodes using atomic layer deposition of ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avalanche photodiodes used for greenhouse gas sensing often use a mesa-structure that suffers from high surface leakage currents and edge breakdown. In this paper, we report 2-micron InGaAs/GaAsSb superlattice (SL) based planar PIN diodes to eliminate the challenges posed by conventional mesa diodes. An alternate way to fabricate planar diodes using atomic layer deposited ZnO was explored and the effect of the diffusion process on the superlattice was studied using X-ray diffraction. The optimum diffusion conditions were then used to make planar PIN diodes. The diffused Zn concentration was measured to be approximately 1E20 cm-3 with a diffusion depth of 50 nm and a lateral diffusion ranging between 18 microns to 30 microns. A background doping of 5.8 x 1E14 cm-3 for the UID layer was determined by analyzing the capacitance-voltage measurements of the superlattice PIN diodes. The room temperature dark current for a device with a designed diameter of 30 microns is 1E-6 A at -2V. The quantum efficiency of the diode with a designed diameter of 200 microns was obtained to be 11.11% at 2-micron illumination. Further optimization of this diffusion process may lead to a rapid, manufacturable, and cost-effective method of developing planar diodes.</description>

      <title>Helium atom micro-diffraction as a characterisation tool for 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present helium atom micro-diffraction as an ideal technique for characterization of 2D materials due to its ultimate surface sensitivity combined with sub-micron spatial resolution. Thermal energy neutral helium scatters from the valence electron density, 2-3A above the ionic cores of a surface, making the technique ideal for studying 2D materials, where other approaches can struggle due to small interaction cross-sections with few-layer samples. Sub-micron spatial resolution is key development in neutral atom scattering to allow measurements from device-scale samples. We present measurements of monolayer-substrate interactions, thermal expansion coefficients, the electron-phonon coupling constant and vacancy-type defect density on monolayer-MoS2. We also discuss extensions to the presented methods which can be immediately implemented on existing instruments to perform spatial mapping of these material properties.</description>

      <title>Miscible fluids patterning and micro-manipulation using vortex-based single-beam acoustic tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex-based single-beam tweezers have the ability to precisely and selectively move a wide range of objects, including particles, bubbles, droplets, and cells with sizes ranging from the millimeter to micrometer scale. In 2017, Karlsen and Bruus [Phys. Rev. Appl. 7, 034017 (2017)] theoretically suggested that these tweezers could also address one of the most challenging issues: the patterning and manipulation of miscible fluids. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate this ability using acoustic vortex beams generated by interdigital transducer-based active holograms. The experimental results are supported by a numerical model based on acoustic body force simulations. This work paves the way for the precise shaping of chemical concentration fields, a crucial factor in numerous chemical and biological processes.</description>

      <title>Closing the reproducibility gap: 2D materials research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D materials research has reached significant scientific milestones, accompanied by a rapidly growing industrial sector in the two decades since the field's inception. Such rapid progress requires pushing past the boundary of what is technically and scientifically feasible and carries the risk of disseminating irreproducible research results. This Expert Recommendation addresses the need for enhanced reproducibility in 2D materials science and physics. Through a comprehensive examination of the factors that affect reproducibility the authors present a set of concrete guidelines designed to improve the reliability of research results. The introduction of a Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures (STEP) offers a novel approach to documenting experimental details that are crucial for replication and troubleshooting. We emphasise the importance of involving stakeholders from research, industry, publishing, funding agencies, and policymaking to foster a culture of transparency, reliability, and trust without blind angles and critical oversights. By addressing systemic issues that hinder reproducibility and presenting actionable steps for improvement, we aim to pave the way for more robust research practices in 2D materials science, contributing to the field's scientific maturation and the subsequent development of beneficial technologies.</description>

      <title>Novel and Simple Method for Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to generate the broadest Raman probe spectrum to our knowledge (spanning -6000 to 0 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Effect of the blast wave interaction on the flame heat release and droplet dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study comprehensively investigates the response of a combusting droplet during its interaction with high-speed transient flow imposed by a coaxially propagating blast wave. The blast wave is generated using a miniature shock generator which facilitates wide Mach number range ($1.01&lt;M_s&lt;1.6$). The interaction of the shock flow occurs in two stages: 1) interaction of the temporally decaying velocity ($\rm v_s$) imposed by blast wave and 2) interaction with the induced flow ($\rm v_{ind}$). The flame base lifts off due to the imposed flow, and the advection of flame base towards flame tip results in flame extinction for $M_s &gt; 1.06$. The timescale of the flame extinction is faster (interaction with $\rm v_s$) for $M_s&gt;1.1$. The study investigates the effect on droplet regression, flame heat release rate and flame topological evolution during the interaction. The droplet regression rate gets enhanced after the interaction with blast wave for $M_s &lt; 1.06$, while it slowed down due to complete extinction for $M_s &gt; 1.06$. A momentary flame heat release rate (HRR) enhancement occurs during the interaction with shock flow, and this HRR enhancement is found to be more than 8 times the nominal unforced flame HRR for $M_s &gt; 1.1$, where rapid flame extinction occurs due to faster interaction with $\rm v_s$ ($\sim O(10^{-1})ms$). HRR enhancement has been attributed to the fuel vapor accumulation during the interaction. Furthermore, for $M_s &gt; 1.1$), compressible vortex interaction occurs with the droplet resulting in droplet atomization. The droplet shows a wide range of atomization response modes ranging for different shock strengths. No significant effect of nanoparticle (NP) addition has been found on the flame dynamics due to the faster timescales. However, minimial effects of NP addition are observed during droplet breakup due to fluid property variation.</description>

      <title>Doping Dependence of Upper Critical Field of High-Tc Cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCaCu2O8+d Estimated from Irreversibility Field at Zero Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the temperature (T) dependence of the irreversibility field Hirr(T) in high-critical-temperature cuprate Bi2+xSr2-xCa1-yYyCu2O8+d (Bi-2212) single crystals over a wide range of hole doping level (p). Hirr(T) was evaluated by measuring the magnetization hysteresis loop. The value of Hirr(T) extrapolated to T = 0 K [Hirr(0)], is either equal to or sets the lower boundary for the upper critical field at T = 0 K [Hc2(0)]. Tc shows a parabolic p-dependence (peak at p = 0.16), whereas Hirr(0) increases monotonically with p by approximately one order of magnitude, from 19 T for the most underdoped sample (p = 0.065, Tc = 24 K) to 209 T for the most overdoped sample (p = 0.200, Tc = 75 K). The present results qualitatively agree with Hc2(0) values evaluated from the specific heat measurements. The observed p-dependence of Hirr(0) in Bi-2212 is distinct from those in YBa2Cu3O7-d and HgBa2CuO6+d, in which a pronounced dip structure appears in the underdoped region. Considering that the dip structures observed in these two systems are likely associated with the formation of competing orders (most likely field-induced charge orders), the present results indicate that the influence of the competing order in Bi-2212 is less prominent than that in the other two systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulation of Wave Transmission Through Space-Time-Varying Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the generalized Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical modelling of electromagnetic wave scattering from space-time-varying media. We investigate the dynamic behavior of generalized oblique and normal incidence of both TM and TE electromagnetic fields on space-time-modulated gratings. In their most general form, these gratings have electrical permittivity, magnetic permeability, and electrical conductivity modulated across both space and time. The FDTD scheme and equations for both TM and TE wave illuminations of space-time-varying slabs are provided. Additionally, intriguing illustrative examples are presented, including the nonlinear multi-beam-multi-frequency generator and linear pure beam-splitting frequency generation for generalized oblique TM wave incidence, as well as the antenna-mixer-amplifier, nonreciprocal slab, diffraction grating, and nonreciprocal beamsplitter for TE wave incidence. Through these examples, we showcase the versatility and potential applications of space-time-varying microwave components in modern communication systems, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Single-gate electro-optic beam switching metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic active metasurfaces have attracted attention due to their ability to electronically control optical wavefront with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. In most studies, such devices require gate arrays composed of a large number of independently-controllable local gate electrodes that address local scattering response of individual metaatoms. Although this approach in principle enables arbitrary wavefront control, the complicated driving mechanism and low optical efficiency have been hindering its practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate an active beam switching device that provides high directivity, uniform efficiency across diffraction orders, and a wide field of view while operating with only a single-gate bias. Experimentally, the metasurface achieves 57{\deg} of active beam switching from the 0th to the -1st order diffraction, with efficiencies of 0.084 and 0.078 and directivities of 0.765 and 0.836, respectively. Furthermore, an analytical framework using nonlocal quasinormal mode expansion provides deeper insight into the operating mechanism of active beam switching. Finally, we discuss the performance limitations of this design platform and provide insights into potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Integrated RF Photonic Front-End Capable of Simultaneous Cascaded Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic (MWP) front-ends are capable of ultra-broadband signal reception and processing. However, state-of-the-art demonstrations are limited to performing only one specific functionality at any given time, which fails to meet the demands of advanced radio frequency applications in real-world electromagnetic environments. In this paper, we present a major departure from the current trend, which is a novel integrated MWP front-end capable of simultaneous cascaded functions with enhanced performances. Our integrated MWP front-end can delay or phase-shift signals within the selected frequency band while simultaneously suppressing noise signals in other frequency bands, resembling the function of a conventional RF front-end chain. Moreover, we implement an on-chip linearization technique to improve the spurious-free dynamic range of the system. Our work represents a paradigm shift in designing RF photonic front-ends and advancing their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Violet to near-infrared optical addressing of spin pairs in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins are an important platform for practical quantum technologies. Van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising host as it contains a wide variety of optical emitters, but thus far observations of addressable spins have been sparse, and most of them lacked a demonstration of coherent spin control. Here we demonstrate robust optical readout of spin pairs in hBN with emission wavelengths spanning from violet to the near-infrared. We find these broadband spin pairs exist naturally in a variety of hBN samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range. Furthermore, we identify the optimal wavelengths for independent readout of spin pairs and boron vacancy spin defects co-existing in the same sample. Our results establish the ubiquity of the optically addressable spin pair system in hBN across a broad parameter space, making it a versatile playground for spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. Recognizing that the RIS control circuit, irrespective of its detailed architecture, can always be represented as a multi-port network with auxiliary ports terminated by tunable individual loads, we physics-compliantly express the BD-RIS-parametrized channel as a multi-port chain cascade of i) radio environment, ii) static parts of the control circuit, and iii) individually tunable loads. Thus, the cascade of the former two systems is terminated by a system that is mathematically always characterized by a diagonal matrix. This physics-compliant diagonal representation implies that existing algorithms for channel estimation and optimization for conventional ("diagonal") RIS can be readily applied to BD-RIS scenarios. We demonstrate this in an experimentally grounded case study. Importantly, we highlight that, operationally, an ambiguous characterization of the cascade of radio environment and the static parts of the control circuit is required, but not the breakdown into the characteristics of its two constituent systems nor the lifting of the ambiguities. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to derive or estimate the characteristics of the static parts of the control circuit for pedagogical purposes. The diagonal representation of BD-RIS-parametrized channels also enables their treatment with coupled-dipole-based models. We furthermore derive the assumptions under which the physics-compliant BD-RIS model simplifies to the widespread linear cascaded model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of the resonator to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. In the noise spectral density, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we obtained deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic oscillator response. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and technoeconomics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, as ensuing efforts to commercialize the technology develop, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic model based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand the relative importance of efficiency and power density. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how five example systems fit into these cost regimes. Finally, we analyze how cell improvements could improve system technoeconomics, and we identify the most impactful properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective way to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems where the TPV cell cost is high. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for a given application and how to maximize it.</description>

      <title>A rapid experimental workflow for studying melt track scaling in laser powder bed fusion using high-precision metal template substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Development and qualification of process parameters in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) commonly involves many variables. At the outset of development, whether transferring known parameters to a new machine, or exploring a new material, single-track and single-layer experiments are a convenient means of down-selecting key variables and exploring parameter scaling behavior. We present an experimental workflow for single-layer LPBF experiments using etched high-precision metal template substrates, overcoming challenges with precision single-layer alignment in LPBF systems and enabling efficient processing and cross-sectional analysis. Templates are fabricated using chemical etching and machining, and are characterized using optical profilometry and X-ray transmission imaging of powder layers. Using the templates a single-track parameter study is performed in SS316 including three powder layer thicknesses, and spanning common laser melting modes (lack-of-fusion, conduction, and keyhole mode). Analysis of melt track geometries using automated image processing allows a scaling law to be applied to define the process window, quantifying the amount of material added with increasing powder layer thickness. Single-track results are verified with raster scanning experiments, showing the potential to transfer single-track results to full LPBF builds.</description>

Abstract: This study optimizes 28 nm planar MOSFET technology to reduce device leakage current and enhance switching speed. The specific aims are to decrease subthreshold swing (S.S.) and mitigate drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect. Silvaco TCAD software is used for process (Athena) and device (Atlas) simulations. For the further development of MOSFET technology, we implemented our device (planar 28 nm n-MOSFET) with high-k metal-gate (HK/MG), lightly doped drain (LDD), multiple spacers (mult-spacers), and silicide. Simulation validation shows improvements over other 28 nm devices, with lower static power consumption and notable optimizations in both S.S. (69.8 mV/dec) and DIBL effect (30.5 mV/V).</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>

Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
