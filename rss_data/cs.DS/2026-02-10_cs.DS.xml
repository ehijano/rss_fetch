      <title>Unsplittable Transshipments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Unsplittable Transshipment Problem in directed graphs with multiple sources and sinks. An unsplittable transshipment routes given supplies and demands using at most one path for each source-sink pair. Although they are a natural generalization of single source unsplittable flows, unsplittable transshipments raise interesting new challenges and require novel algorithmic techniques. As our main contribution, we give a nontrivial generalization of a seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans (1999) by showing how to efficiently turn a given transshipment $x$ into an unsplittable transshipment $y$ with $y_a&lt;x_a+d_{\max}$ for all arcs $a$, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum demand (or supply) value. Further results include bounds on the number of rounds required to satisfy all demands, where each round consists of an unsplittable transshipment that routes a subset of the demands while respecting arc capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Online Algorithm for Fractional Matchings with Edge Arrivals in Graphs of Maximum Degree Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online algorithms for maximum cardinality matchings with edge arrivals in graphs of low degree. Buchbinder, Segev, and Tkach showed that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings can achieve a competitive ratio larger than $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ even for graphs of maximum degree three. The negative result of Buchbinder et al. holds even when the graph is bipartite and edges are revealed according to vertex arrivals, i.e. once a vertex arrives, all edges are revealed that include the newly arrived vertex and one of the previously arrived vertices. In this work, we complement the negative result of Buchbinder et al. by providing an online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings with a competitive ratio at least $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ for graphs of maximum degree three. We also demonstrate that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality integral matchings can have the competitive guarantee $0.5807$, establishing a gap between integral and fractional matchings for graphs of maximum degree three. Note that the work of Buchbinder et al. shows that for graphs of maximum degree two, there is no such gap between fractional and integral matchings, because for both of them the best achievable competitive ratio is $2/3$. Also, our results demonstrate that for graphs of maximum degree three best possible competitive ratios for fractional matchings are the same in the vertex arrival and in the edge arrival models.</description>

      <title>Local Computation Algorithms for (Minimum) Spanning Trees on Expander Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study \emph{local computation algorithms (LCAs)} for constructing spanning trees. In this setting, the goal is to locally determine, for each edge $ e \in E $, whether it belongs to a spanning tree $ T $ of the input graph $ G $, where $ T $ is defined implicitly by $ G $ and the randomness of the algorithm. It is known that LCAs for spanning trees do not exist in general graphs, even for simple graph families. We identify a natural and well-studied class of graphs -- \emph{expander graphs} -- that do admit \emph{sublinear-time} LCAs for spanning trees. This is perhaps surprising, as previous work on expanders only succeeded in designing LCAs for \emph{sparse spanning subgraphs}, rather than full spanning trees. We design an LCA with probe complexity $ O\left(\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{\phi^2} + d\right)\right)$ for graphs with conductance at least $ \phi $ and maximum degree at most $ d $ (not necessarily constant), which is nearly optimal when $\phi$ and $d$ are constants, since $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ probes are necessary even for expanders. Next, we show that for the natural class of \emph{\ER graphs} $ G(n, p) $ with $ np = n^{\delta} $ for any constant $ \delta &gt; 0 $ (which are expanders with high probability), the $ \sqrt{n} $ lower bound can be bypassed. Specifically, we give an \emph{average-case} LCA for such graphs with probe complexity $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{n^{1 - \delta}})$.
  Finally, we extend our techniques to design LCAs for the \emph{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem on weighted expander graphs. Specifically, given a $d$-regular unweighted graph $\bar{G}$ with sufficiently strong expansion, we consider the weighted graph $G$ obtained by assigning to each edge an independent and uniform random weight from $\{1,\ldots,W\}$, where $W = O(d)$. We show that there exists an LCA that is consistent with an exact MST of $G$, with probe complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}d^2)$.</description>

      <title>Robust Multiagent Collaboration Through Weighted Max-Min T-Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multiagent tasks -- such as reviewer assignment, coalition formation, or fair resource allocation -- require selecting a group of agents such that collaboration remains effective even in the worst case. The \emph{weighted max-min $T$-join problem} formalizes this challenge by seeking a subset of vertices whose minimum-weight matching is maximized, thereby ensuring robust outcomes against unfavorable pairings.
  We advance the study of this problem in several directions. First, we design an algorithm that computes an upper bound for the \emph{weighted max-min $2k$-matching problem}, where the chosen set must contain exactly $2k$ vertices. Building on this bound, we develop a general algorithm with a \emph{$2 \ln n$-approximation guarantee} that runs in $O(n^4)$ time. Second, using ear decompositions, we propose another upper bound for the weighted max-min $T$-join cost. We also show that the problem can be solved exactly when edge weights belong to $\{1,2\}$.
  Finally, we evaluate our methods on real collaboration datasets. Experiments show that the lower bounds from our approximation algorithm and the upper bounds from the ear decomposition method are consistently close, yielding empirically small constant-factor approximations. Overall, our results highlight both the theoretical significance and practical value of weighted max-min $T$-joins as a framework for fair and robust group formation in multiagent systems.</description>

      <title>A Faster Directed Single-Source Shortest Path Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07868v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on real non-negative edge-weighted directed graphs, with running time $O(m\sqrt{\log n}+\sqrt{mn\log n\log \log n})$, which is $O(m\sqrt{\log n\log \log n})$ for sparse graphs. This improves the recent breakthrough result of $O(m\log^{2/3} n)$ time for directed SSSP algorithm [Duan, Mao, Mao, Shu, Yin 2025].</description>

      <title>Space Complexity Dichotomies for Subgraph Finding Problems in the Streaming Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space complexity of four variants of the standard subgraph finding problem in the streaming model. Specifically, given an $n$-vertex input graph and a fixed-size pattern graph, we consider two settings: undirected simple graphs, denoted by $G$ and $H$, and oriented graphs, denoted by $\vec{G}$ and $\vec{H}$. Depending on the setting, the task is to decide whether $G$ contains $H$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph, or whether $\vec{G}$ contains $\vec{H}$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph. Let Sub$(H)$, IndSub$(H)$, Sub$(\vec{H})$, and IndSub$(\vec{H})$ denote these four variants, respectively.
  An oriented graph is well-oriented if it admits a bipartition in which every arc is oriented from one part to the other, and a vertex is non-well-oriented if both its in-degree and out-degree are non-zero. For each variant, we obtain a complete dichotomy theorem, briefly summarized as follows.
  (1) Sub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H$ is bipartite.
  (2) IndSub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H \in \{P_3, P_4, co\mbox{-}P_3\}$.
  (3) Sub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by a single-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if every connected component of $\vec H$ is either a well-oriented bipartite graph or a tree containing at most one non-well-oriented vertex.
  (4) IndSub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if the underlying undirected simple graph $H$ is a $co\mbox{-}P_3$.</description>

      <title>Prune, Don't Rebuild: Efficiently Tuning $\alpha$-Reachable Graphs for Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector similarity search is an essential primitive in modern AI and ML applications. Most vector databases adopt graph-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms, such as DiskANN (Subramanya et al., 2019), which have demonstrated state-of-the-art empirical performance. DiskANN's graph construction is governed by a reachability parameter $\alpha$, which gives a trade-off between construction time, query time, and accuracy. However, adaptively tuning this trade-off typically requires rebuilding the index for different $\alpha$ values, which is prohibitive at scale. In this work, we propose RP-Tuning, an efficient post-hoc routine, based on DiskANN's pruning step, to adjust the $\alpha$ parameter without reconstructing the full index. Within the $\alpha$-reachability framework of prior theoretical works (Indyk and Xu, 2023; Gollapudi et al., 2025), we prove that pruning an initially $\alpha$-reachable graph with RP-Tuning preserves worst-case reachability guarantees in general metrics and improved guarantees in Euclidean metrics. Empirically, we show that RP-Tuning accelerates DiskANN tuning on four public datasets by up to $43\times$ with negligible overhead.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by optimization oracles in bandits with network interference, we study the Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling (NAGL) problem. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\sum_{v \in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\!\left(n\cdot \mathrm{tw}(G^2)\cdot L^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\right)$ time. For approximation, unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is no polynomial-time $n^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation on general graphs even under the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$; without the promise $\mathrm{OPT}&gt;0$, no finite multiplicative approximation ratio is possible. In the nonnegative-reward regime, we give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NAGL in two settings: (i) given a proper $q$-coloring of $G^2$, we obtain a $1/q$-approximation; and (ii) on planar graphs of bounded maximum degree, we develop a Baker-type polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which becomes an efficient PTAS (EPTAS) when $L$ is constant.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann sampling and optimal exact-size sampling for directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two efficient algorithms for generating uniform random directed acyclic graphs, including an asymptotically optimal exact-size sampler that performs $\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2)$ operations and requests to a random generator. This was achieved by extending the Boltzmann model for graphical generating functions and by using various decompositions of directed acyclic graphs. The presented samplers improve upon the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of theoretical complexity and offer a significant speed-up in practice.</description>

      <title>Submodular Maximization over a Matroid $k$-Intersection: Multiplicative Improvement over Greedy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a non-negative monotone submodular objective $f$ subject to the intersection of $k$ arbitrary matroid constraints. The natural greedy algorithm guarantees $(k+1)$-approximation for this problem, and the state-of-the-art algorithm only improves this approximation ratio to $k$. We give a $\frac{2k\ln2}{1+\ln2}+O(\sqrt{k})&lt;0.819k+O(\sqrt{k})$ approximation for this problem. Our result is the first multiplicative improvement over the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for general $k$. We further show that our algorithm can be used to obtain roughly the same approximation ratio also for the more general problem in which the objective is not guaranteed to be monotone (the sublinear term in the approximation ratio becomes $O(k^{2/3})$ rather than $O(\sqrt{k})$ in this case).
  All of our results hold also when the $k$-matroid intersection constraint is replaced with a more general matroid $k$-parity constraint. Furthermore, unlike the case in many of the previous works, our algorithms run in time that is independent of $k$ and polynomial in the size of the ground set. Our algorithms are based on a hybrid greedy local search approach recently introduced by Singer and Thiery (STOC 2025) for the weighted matroid $k$-intersection problem, which is a special case of the problem we consider. Leveraging their approach in the submodular setting requires several non-trivial insights and algorithmic modifications since the marginals of a submodular function $f$, which correspond to the weights in the weighted case, are not independent of the algorithm's internal randomness. In the special weighted case studied by Singer and Thiery, our algorithms reduce to a variant of their algorithm with an improved approximation ratio of $k\ln2+1-\ln2&lt;0.694k+0.307$, compared to an approximation ratio of $\frac{k+1}{2\ln2}\approx0.722k+0.722$ guaranteed by Singer and Thiery.</description>

      <title>Incremental (k, z)-Clustering on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a weighted undirected graph, a number of clusters $k$, and an exponent $z$, the goal in the $(k, z)$-clustering problem on graphs is to select $k$ vertices as centers that minimize the sum of the distances raised to the power $z$ of each vertex to its closest center. In the dynamic setting, the graph is subject to adversarial edge updates, and the goal is to maintain explicitly an exact $(k, z)$-clustering solution in the induced shortest-path metric.
  While efficient dynamic $k$-center approximation algorithms on graphs exist [Cruciani et al. SODA 2024], to the best of our knowledge, no prior work provides similar results for the dynamic $(k,z)$-clustering problem. As the main result of this paper, we develop a randomized incremental $(k, z)$-clustering algorithm that maintains with high probability a constant-factor approximation in a graph undergoing edge insertions with a total update time of $\tilde O(k m^{1+o(1)}+ k^{1+\frac{1}{\lambda}} m)$, where $\lambda \geq 1$ is an arbitrary fixed constant. Our incremental algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, we maintain a constant-factor bicriteria approximate solution of size $\tilde{O}(k)$ with a total update time of $m^{1+o(1)}$ over all adversarial edge insertions. This first stage is an intricate adaptation of the bicriteria approximation algorithm by Mettu and Plaxton [Machine Learning 2004] to incremental graphs. One of our key technical results is that the radii in their algorithm can be assumed to be non-decreasing while the approximation ratio remains constant, a property that may be of independent interest.
  In the second stage, we maintain a constant-factor approximate $(k,z)$-clustering solution on a dynamic weighted instance induced by the bicriteria approximate solution. For this subproblem, we employ a dynamic spanner algorithm together with a static $(k,z)$-clustering algorithm.</description>

      <title>Approximate Cartesian Tree Matching with Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cartesian tree of a sequence captures the relative order of the sequence's elements. In recent years, Cartesian tree matching has attracted considerable attention, particularly due to its applications in time series analysis. Consider a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$. In the exact Cartesian tree matching problem, the task is to find all length-$m$ fragments of $T$ whose Cartesian tree coincides with the Cartesian tree $CT(P)$ of the pattern. Although the exact version of the problem can be solved in linear time [Park et al., TCS 2020], it remains rather restrictive; for example, it is not robust to outliers in the pattern.
  To overcome this limitation, we consider the approximate setting, where the goal is to identify all fragments of $T$ that are close to some string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. In this work, we quantify closeness via the widely used Hamming distance metric. For a given integer parameter $k&gt;0$, we present an algorithm that computes all fragments of $T$ that are at Hamming distance at most $k$ from a string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. Our algorithm runs in time $\mathcal O(n \sqrt{m} \cdot k^{2.5})$ for $k \leq m^{1/5}$ and in time $\mathcal O(nk^5)$ for $k \geq m^{1/5}$, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-art $\mathcal O(nmk)$-time algorithm of Kim and Han [TCS 2025] in the regime $k = o(m^{1/4})$.
  On the way to our solution, we develop a toolbox of independent interest. First, we introduce a new notion of periodicity in Cartesian trees. Then, we lift multiple well-known combinatorial and algorithmic results for string matching and periodicity in strings to Cartesian tree matching and periodicity in Cartesian trees.</description>

Abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Nearest-Neighbor Search without the Spread</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$Recent work showed how to construct nearest-neighbor graphs of linear size, on a given set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, such that one can answer approximate nearest-neighbor queries in logarithmic time in the spread. Unfortunately, the spread might be unbounded in $n$, and an interesting theoretical question is how to remove the dependency on the spread. Here, we show how to construct an external linear-size data structure that, combined with the linear-size graph, allows us to answer ANN queries in logarithmic time in $n$.</description>

      <title>Compact Conformal Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides rigorous, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees, but often yields prohibitively large prediction sets in structured domains such as routing, planning, or sequential recommendation. We introduce "graph-based conformal compression", a framework for constructing compact subgraphs that preserve statistical validity while reducing structural complexity. We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees. Our results on the one hand bridge efficient conformal prediction with combinatorial graph compression via monotonicity, to provide rigorous guarantees on both statistical validity, and compression or size. On the other hand, they also highlight an algorithmic regime, distinct from classical densest-$k$-subgraph hardness settings, where the problem can be approximated efficiently. We finally validate our algorithmic approach via simulations for trip planning and navigation, and compare to natural baselines.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Independent Set and More when Excluding a Half-Graph, Co-Matching, or Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Ding, Oporowski, Oxley, and Vertigan implies that any sufficiently large twin-free graph contains a large matching, a co-matching, or a half-graph as a semi-induced subgraph. The sizes of these unavoidable patterns are measured by the matching index, co-matching index, and half-graph index of a graph. Consequently, graph classes can be organized into the eight classes determined by which of the three indices are bounded.
  We completely classify the parameterized complexity of Independent Set, Clique, and Dominating Set across all eight of these classes. For this purpose, we first derive multiple tractability and hardness results from the existing literature, and then proceed to fill the identified gaps. Among our novel results, we show that Independent Set is fixed-parameter tractable on every graph class where the half-graph and co-matching indices are simultaneously bounded. Conversely, we construct a graph class with bounded half-graph index (but unbounded co-matching index), for which the problem is W[1]-hard.
  For the W[1]-hard cases of our classification, we review the state of approximation algorithms. Here, we contribute an approximation algorithm for Independent Set on classes of bounded half-graph index.</description>

      <title>A Two-Layer Framework for Joint Online Configuration Selection and Admission Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online configuration selection with admission control problem, which arises in LLM serving, GPU scheduling, and revenue management. In a planning horizon with $T$ periods, we consider a two-layer framework for the decisions made within each time period. In the first layer, the decision maker selects one of the $K$ configurations (ex. quantization, parallelism, fare class) which induces distribution over the reward-resource pair of the incoming request. In the second layer, the decision maker observes the request and then decides whether to accept it or not.
  Benchmarking this framework requires care. We introduce a \textbf{switching-aware fluid oracle} that accounts for the value of mixing configurations over time, provably upper-bounding any online policy. We derive a max-min formulation for evaluating the benchmark, and we characterize saddle points of the max-min problem via primal-dual optimality conditions linking equilibrium, feasibility, and complementarity. This guides the design of \textbf{SP-UCB--OLP} algorithm, which solves an optimistic saddle point problem and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ regret.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Data Analysis over Dense Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data workflows are inherently adaptive, repeatedly querying the same dataset to refine and validate sequential decisions, but such adaptivity can lead to overfitting and invalid statistical inference. Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Wheeler Bisimulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new paradigm was introduced in automata theory. The main idea is to classify regular languages according to their propensity to be sorted, establishing a deep connection between automata theory and data compression [J. ACM 2023]. This parameterization leads to two hierarchies of regular languages: a deterministic hierarchy and a non-deterministic hierarchy. While the deterministic hierarchy is well understood, the non-deterministic hierarchy appears much more complex. This is true even for the richest and most studied level of the hierarchies, corresponding to the class of Wheeler languages.
  In this paper, we study Wheeler language through the lens of bisimulations. We first show that the standard notion of bisimulation is not appropriate. Then, we introduce Wheeler bisimulations, that is, bisimulations that respect the convex structure of the considered Wheeler automata. Although there are some differences between the properties of bisimulations and the properties of Wheeler bisimulations, we show that Wheeler bisimulations induce a unique minimal Wheeler NFA (analogously to standard bisimulations). In particular, in the deterministic case, we retrieve the minimum Wheeler deterministic automaton of a given language. We also show that the minimal Wheeler NFA induced by Wheeler bisimulations can be built in linear time. This is in contrast with standard bisimulations, for which the corresponding minimal NFA can be built in $ O(m \log n) $ time (where $ m $ is the number of edges and $ n $ is the number of states) by adapting Paige-Tarjan's partition refinement algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We derive Singleton-type bounds on the free distance and column distances of trellis codes. Our results show that, at a given time instant, the maximum attainable column distance of trellis codes can exceed that of convolutional codes. Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Swap Regret Minimization for Convex Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a randomized online algorithm that guarantees near-optimal $\widetilde O(\sqrt T)$ expected swap regret against any sequence of $T$ adaptively chosen Lipschitz convex losses on the unit interval. This improves the previous best bound of $\widetilde O(T^{2/3})$ and answers an open question of Fishelson et al. [2025b]. In addition, our algorithm is efficient: it runs in $\mathsf{poly}(T)$ time. A key technical idea we develop to obtain this result is to discretize the unit interval into bins at multiple scales of granularity and simultaneously use all scales to make randomized predictions, which we call multi-scale binning and may be of independent interest. A direct corollary of our result is an efficient online algorithm for minimizing the calibration error for general elicitable properties. This result does not require the Lipschitzness assumption of the identification function needed in prior work, making it applicable to median calibration, for which we achieve the first $\widetilde O(\sqrt T)$ calibration error guarantee.</description>

      <title>Distortion of Metric Voting with Bounded Randomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of voting rules in the metric distortion framework. It is known that any deterministic rule suffers distortion of at least $3$, and that randomized rules can achieve distortion strictly less than $3$, often at the cost of reduced transparency and interpretability. In this work, we explore the trade-off between these paradigms by asking whether it is possible to break the distortion barrier of $3$ using only "bounded" randomness. We answer in the affirmative by presenting a voting rule that (1) achieves distortion of at most $3 - \varepsilon$ for some absolute constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and (2) selects a winner uniformly at random from a deterministically identified list of constant size. Our analysis builds on new structural results for the distortion and approximation of Maximal Lotteries and Stable Lotteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic correlation clustering problem with $\textit{adaptive}$ edge label flips. In correlation clustering, we are given a $n$-vertex complete graph whose edges are labeled either $(+)$ or $(-)$, and the goal is to minimize the total number of $(+)$ edges between clusters and the number of $(-)$ edges within clusters. We consider the dynamic setting with adversarial robustness, in which the $\textit{adaptive}$ adversary could flip the label of an edge based on the current output of the algorithm. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that always maintains an $O(1)$-approximation to the optimal correlation clustering with $O(\log^{2}{n})$ amortized update time. Prior to our work, no algorithm with $O(1)$-approximation and $\text{polylog}{(n)}$ update time for the adversarially robust setting was known. We further validate our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with competitive empirical performances. Our main technical ingredient is an algorithm that maintains $\textit{sparse-dense decomposition}$ with $\text{polylog}{(n)}$ update time, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Combinatorial Approach to Proving Chernoff Bounds and Their Generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chernoff bound is one of the most widely used tools in theoretical computer science. It's rare to find a randomized algorithm that doesn't employ a Chernoff bound in its analysis. The standard proofs of Chernoff bounds are beautiful but in some ways not very intuitive. In this paper, I'll show you a different proof that has four features: (1) the proof offers a strong intuition for why Chernoff bounds look the way that they do; (2) the proof is user-friendly and (almost) algebra-free; (3) the proof comes with matching lower bounds, up to constant factors in the exponent; and (4) the proof extends to establish generalizations of Chernoff bounds in other settings. The ultimate goal is that, once you know this proof (and with a bit of practice), you should be able to confidently reason about Chernoff-style bounds in your head, extending them to other settings, and convincing yourself that the bounds you're obtaining are tight (up to constant factors in the exponent).</description>

      <title>The Structural Complexity of Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{M}$, and supporting queries that, for any vector $v$, returns the matrix-vector product $\mathbf{M} v$. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas on the other side, theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Hence, we study the problem for \emph{structured} matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ Boolean matrices of VC-dimension $d$, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Furthermore, we show how to extend this result to the non-Boolean setting with the Pollard pseudodimension.
  Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector (OMv) hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query, even over the boolean semi-ring) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for effective resistance, Laplacian solvers, shortest paths, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector multiplication result, we show we can maintain these problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified framework that yields EPASes for constrained $(k,z)$-clustering in metric spaces of bounded (algorithmic) scatter dimension, a notion introduced by Abbasi et al. (FOCS 2023). They showed that several well known metric families, including continuous Euclidean spaces, bounded doubling spaces, planar metrics, and bounded treewidth metrics, have bounded scatter dimension. Subsequently, Bourneuf and Pilipczuk (SODA 2025) proved that this also holds for metrics induced by graphs from any fixed proper minor closed class. Our result, in particular, addresses a major open question of Abbasi et al., whose approach to $k$-clustering in such metrics was inherently limited to \emph{Voronoi-based} objectives, where each point is connected only to its nearest chosen center.
  As a consequence, we obtain EPASes for several constrained clustering problems, including capacitated and matroid $(k,z)$-clustering, fault tolerant and fair $(k,z)$-clustering, as well as for metrics of bounded highway dimension. In particular, our results on capacitated and fair $k$-Median and $k$-Means provide the first EPASes for these problems across broad families of structured metrics. Previously, such results were known only in continuous Euclidean spaces, due to the works of Cohen-Addad and Li (ICALP 2019) and Bandyapadhyay, Fomin, and Simonov (ICALP 2021; JCSS 2024), respectively. Along the way, we also obtain faster EPASes for uncapacitated $k$-Median and $k$-Means, improving upon the running time of the algorithm by Abbasi et al. (FOCS 2023).</description>

      <title>Minimizing Envy and Maximizing Happiness in Graphical House Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the house allocation problem in a setting where agents are connected by a graph representing friendships. In this model, two agents can only envy each other if they are neighbors (i.e., friends) in the graph. Each agent has a set of preferred (liked) houses and dislikes the rest. An agent $a$ is said to envy a friend $b$ if $a$ is not assigned any house she likes, while $b$ is allocated a house that $a$ likes. This framework is known as graphical house allocation.
  Within this framework, we investigate two central problems. The first problem is to compute a house allocation that minimizes the number of envious agents. Multiple such allocations may exist that achieve the same minimum level of envy. Among all allocations that minimize envy, the second problem aims to find one that maximizes the number of agents who receive one of their preferred houses.
  We present a detailed complexity-theoretic analysis of these problems. In particular, we show that both problems can be solved in polynomial time when each agent prefers at most one house. However, both become NP-hard even when agents are allowed to prefer at most two houses, thereby highlighting the tight boundary between tractability and intractability.
  Additionally, we design exact algorithms for both problems under certain structural conditions on the agent graph, such as when the graph is sparse, has a small balanced separator, or admits a small vertex cover. These algorithms are significantly faster than the naive brute-force approach.</description>

      <title>Fast and Simple Densest Subgraph with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the densest subgraph problem and its variants through the lens of learning-augmented algorithms. We show that, given a reasonably accurate predictor that estimates whether a node belongs to the densest subgraph (e.g., a machine-learning classifier), one can design simple and practical linear-time algorithms that achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to the densest subgraph. Our approach also extends to the NP-Hard densest at-most-$k$ subgraph problem and to the directed densest subgraph variant. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Compressing Suffix Trees by Path Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The suffix tree is arguably the most fundamental data structure on strings: introduced by Weiner (SWAT 1973) and McCreight (JACM 1976), it allows solving a myriad of computational problems on strings in linear time. Motivated by its large space usage, subsequent research focused first on reducing its size by a constant factor via Suffix Arrays, and later on reaching space proportional to the size of the compressed string. Modern compressed indexes, such as the $r$-index (Gagie et al., SODA 2018), fit in space proportional to $r$, the number of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform (a strong and universal repetitiveness measure). These advances, however, came with a price: while modern compressed indexes boast optimal bounds in the RAM model, they are often orders of magnitude slower than uncompressed counterparts in practice due to catastrophic cache locality. This reality gap highlights that Big-O complexity in the RAM model has become a misleading predictor of real-world performance, leaving a critical question unanswered: can we design compressed indexes that are efficient in the I/O model of computation?
  We answer this in the affirmative by introducing a new Suffix Array sampling technique based on particular path decompositions of the suffix tree. We prove that sorting the suffix tree leaves by specific priority functions induces a decomposition where the number of distinct paths (each corresponding to a string suffix) is bounded by $r$. This allows us to solve indexed pattern matching efficiently in the I/O model using a Suffix Array sample of size at most $r$, strictly improving upon the (tight) $2r$ bound of Suffixient Arrays, another recent compressed Suffix Array sampling technique.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and functional inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of this problem is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be unbounded.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemingly moderate strengthening from (1) to (1*) yields an exponential gap in the query complexity.
  Furthermore, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. We also establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality for $\mu$ under these conditions. As an application of our technique, we obtain a new estimate of the modified log-Sobolev constant for a specific class of mixtures of strongly log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Lower Bounds for $k$-Edge Connectivity in the Distributed Sketching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $k$-edge connectivity problem on undirected graphs in the distributed sketching model, where we have $n$ nodes and a referee. Each node sends a single message to the referee based on its 1-hop neighborhood in the graph, and the referee must decide whether the graph is $k$-edge connected by taking into account the received messages.
  We present the first lower bound for deciding a graph connectivity problem in this model with a deterministic algorithm. Concretely, we show that the worst case message length is $\Omega( k )$ bits for $k$-edge connectivity, for any super-constant $k = O(\sqrt{n})$. Previously, only a lower bound of $\Omega( \log^3 n )$ bits was known for ($1$-edge) connectivity, due to Yu (SODA 2021). In fact, our result is the first super-polylogarithmic lower bound for a connectivity decision problem in the distributed graph sketching model.
  To obtain our result, we introduce a new lower bound graph construction, as well as a new 3-party communication complexity problem that we call UniqueOverlap. As this problem does not appear to be amenable to reductions to existing hard problems such as set disjointness or indexing due to correlations between the inputs of the three players, we leverage results from cross-intersecting set families to prove the hardness of UniqueOverlap for deterministic algorithms. Finally, we obtain the sought lower bound for deciding $k$-edge connectivity via a novel simulation argument that, in contrast to previous works, does not introduce any probability of error and thus works for deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimally detecting uniformly-distributed $\ell_2$ heavy hitters in data streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a stream $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ of items from a Universe $U$ of size poly$(n)$, and a parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$, an item $i\in U$ is said to be an $\ell_2$ heavy hitter if its frequency $f_i$ in the stream is at least $\sqrt{\epsilon F_2}$, where $F_2={\sum_{i\in U} f_i^2}$. Efficiently detecting such heavy hitters is a fundamental problem in data streams and has several applications in both theory and in practice. The classical $\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton [2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\ell_2$ heavy hitters using $O\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{\epsilon}\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is optimal for streams with deletions. A work due to Braverman, Chestnut, Ivkin, Nelson, Wang, and Woodruff [2017] gave the $\mathsf{BPTree}$ algorithm which detects $\ell_2$ heavy hitters in insertion-only streams using only $O\left(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}\log n \right)$ space. Note that any algorithm requires at least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ space to output $O(1/\epsilon)$ heavy hitters in the worst case. While $\mathsf{BPTree}$ achieves optimal space bound for constant $\epsilon$, their bound could be sub-optimal for $\epsilon=o(1)$. For $\textit{random order}$ streams, where the stream elements can be adversarial but their order of arrival is uniformly random, Braverman, Garg, and Woodruff [2020] showed that it is possible to achieve the optimal space bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ for every $\epsilon = \Omega\left(\frac{1}{2^{\sqrt{\log n}}}\right)$. In this work, we generalize their result to $\textit{partially random order}$ streams where only the heavy hitters are required to be uniformly distributed in the stream. We show that it is possible to achieve the same space bound, but with an additional assumption that the algorithm is given a constant approximation to $F_2$ in advance.</description>

      <title>Uncrossed Multiflows and Applications to Disjoint Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiflow in a planar graph is uncrossed if its support paths do not cross. Recently such flows played a role in approximation algorithms for maximum disjoint paths in "fully-planar" instances, where the combined supply-demand graph is planar, as well as low-congestion unsplittable flows for fully-planar and single-source instances.
  We expand on the theory of uncrossed flows to investigate their utility more generally. We ask three key questions. First, are there other interesting planar multiflow instances that admit uncrossed flows? We answer affirmatively, demonstrating a new family of "pairwise-planar" instances whose flows can be uncrossed. This family subsumes fully-planar but includes substantially more, such as fully-compliant series-parallel instances, and has instances with clique demand graphs. Second, given a fractional uncrossed flow, can we always round it to a "good" integral flow? We again answer positively. For maximization problems (where we maximize the total amount of flow), we obtain integral flows with a constant fraction of the original value. For congestion problems (where we fully route specific given demands), we obtain integral flows with edge congestion 2, or unsplittable flows with an additional additive error. As a consequence we obtain approximation algorithms for maximum disjoint paths and minimum congestion integer multiflow for pairwise-planar instances.
  Finally, given a planar multiflow instance, can we determine if there exists a congestion 1 uncrossed fractional flow (congestion) or find the highest value uncrossed fractional flow (maximization)? For the congestion model, we show this is NP-hard, but finding uncrossed edge-disjoint paths is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded number of faces. For the maximization model, we present a strong inapproximability result.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Matroids: Base Packing and Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider dynamic matroids, where elements can be inserted to or deleted from the ground set over time. The independent sets change to reflect the current ground set. As matroids are central to the study of many combinatorial optimization problems, it is a natural next step to also consider them in a dynamic setting. The study of dynamic matroids has the potential to generalize several dynamic graph problems, including, but not limited to, arboricity and maximum bipartite matching. We contribute by providing efficient algorithms for some fundamental matroid questions.
  In particular, we study the most basic question of maintaining a base dynamically, providing an essential building block for future algorithms. We further utilize this result and consider the elementary problems of base packing and base covering. We provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base packing number $\Phi$ in $O(\Phi \cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Similarly, we provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $\beta$ in $O(\beta \cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Moreover, we give an algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $\beta$ in $O(\text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update against an oblivious adversary.
  These results are obtained by exploring the relationship between base collections, a generalization of tree-packings, and base packing and covering respectively. We provide structural theorems to formalize these connections, and show how they lead to simple dynamic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Branch-width of connectivity functions is fixed-parameter tractable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} \gamma n^6 \log n$, where $\gamma$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2007], which runs in time $\gamma n^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hlin\v{e}n\'y [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.</description>

Abstract: We present simple differentially private estimators for the mean and covariance of multivariate sub-Gaussian data that are accurate at small sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms both theoretically and empirically using synthetic and real-world datasets -- showing that their asymptotic error rates match the state-of-the-art theoretical bounds, and that they concretely outperform all previous methods. Specifically, previous estimators either have weak empirical accuracy at small sample sizes, perform poorly for multivariate data, or require the user to provide strong a priori estimates for the parameters.</description>

      <title>The Ideal Membership Problem and Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given polynomials $f_0,\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications. For instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
  Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] advanced these results to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] to systems of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input polynomial has bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Young domination on Hamming rectangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of domination-type problems in Cartesian products of two graphs. The framework captures several well-studied topics, including variants of bootstrap percolation, line growth, distance domination, and target set selection. We focus on Cartesian products of two complete graphs and formulate the notion of Young domination number in terms of a growth rule determined by a Young diagram; this number is the smallest cardinality of an initial set that covers the entire vertex set in a prescribed number $L$ of iterations of the rule.
  We compute the Young domination number with $L=1$ for several natural cases, including $k$-domination for Cartesian products of two complete graphs of the same order, thereby proving a conjecture from 2009 due to Burchett, Lane, and Lachniet. We show that the case of $L=1$ of Young domination is equivalent to computing bipartite Tur\'an numbers for families of double stars, yielding implications of our results in extremal graph theory. For arbitrary fixed $L$, we devise constant-factor approximation algorithms for the problem. Our approach is based on a variety of techniques, including duality between Young diagrams, algebraic formulations, explicit constructions, and dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>On the Space Complexity of Online Convolution</title>

Abstract: We study a discrete convolution streaming problem. An input arrives as a stream of numbers $z = (z_0,z_1,z_2,\ldots)$, and at time $t$ our goal is to output $(Tz)_t$ where $T$ is a lower-triangular Toeplitz matrix. We focus on space complexity; we define a model for studying the memory-size of online continuous algorithms. In this model, algorithms store a buffer of $\beta(t)$ numbers in order to achieve their goal.
  We characterize space complexity using the language of generating functions. The matrix $T$ corresponds to a generating function $G(x)$. When $G(x)$ is rational of degree $d$, it is known that the space complexity is at most $O(d)$. We prove a corresponding lower bound; the space complexity is at least $\Omega(d)$. In addition, for irrational $G(x)$, we prove that the space complexity is infinite. We also provide finite-time guarantees. For example, for the generating function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ that was studied in various previous works in the context of differentially private continual counting, we prove a sharp lower bound on the space complexity; at time $t$, it is at least $\Omega(t)$.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and $p$ robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of $p$. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph $G = (V, E)$, achieving a running time of $\mathcal{O}(p \cdot (|V| + |E|))$ in sparse graphs and $\mathcal{O}(|V| + |E|)$ in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph $G$ that is not universally solvable for $p$ robots, the question is to check if for a given budget $b$, at most $b$ edges can be added to $G$ to make it universally solvable for $p$ robots. We provide an upper bound of $p - 2$ on $b$ for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require $\Theta(p)$ edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where $a$ vertices and $b$ edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on $a$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>Colorful Minors</title>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical concept of rooted minors in graphs. A $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair $(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing three core theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where $\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face. Our results reveal that when exclusion is imposed not only on graphs but also to the way colors are distributed in them, a more refined structural landscape appears.
  Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -- parameterized by the number $q$ of colors -- of all colorful graphs that exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the algorithmic side, we deduce that colorful minor testing is fixed-parameter tractable. Together with the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.</description>

      <title>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</description>
