      <title>Misfit layer superconductors, tuneable bulk heterostructures with strong 2D effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin layered materials are systems with zero limit bulk-to-surface ratio. Their physical properties are determined by two-dimensionality and strongly affected by interfacing with other systems. Therefore, they represent an accessible platform for the abundance of quantum effects that can be engineered by combining them into vertical stacks. Two types of layered systems are considered here - artificially prepared (exfoliated) van der Waals nanostructures, and naturally layered systems showing quasi 2D behaviour already in a bulk form. A special class of naturally layered materials is misfit structures combining atomic layers of hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides and slabs of tetragonal ionic rare-earth monochalcogenides in the same superlattice. Both types of layered systems feature a new state of quantum matter, the Ising superconductivity extremely resilient to external magnetic field. A giant electron doping, natural to the misfit structures, can lead to topological superconductivity. Both systems can also be assembled into heterostructures combining different constituents. Layered 2D heterostructures have a large number of implications for many potential applications in solid-state devices.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced topological changes in Fermi surface of two-dimensional molecular conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated X-ray structural analysis of the pressure-induced superconductor, $\beta'$-ET$_2$ICl$_2$ under extremely high-pressure conditions, where ET denotes bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene. This material has been known as the highest transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductor among organic superconductors ($T_c=14.2$ K at $8.2$ GPa). On the basis of the experimental results, ab-initio models were derived using the constrained random phase approximation. We revealed that the Lifshitz transition exists behind the Mott insulator-metal transition and found that the value of the on-site Coulomb interaction was halved to around $10$ GPa compared to that at ambient pressure. This study clarifies the enigmatic origins of high $T_{\rm c}$, and concurrently, provides a new understanding of the impacts of structural alterations in organic materials under high pressure on their electronic properties and the superconductivity process.</description>

      <title>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Preformed Cooper Pairs in a Triclinic Iron Pnictide Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron pairing along with phase coherence generates superconductivity below the critical temperature ($T_c$). In underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates, these two quantum phenomena may occur at separate temperatures, which was lately confirmed in the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we report a systematic investigation on the pre-pairing behavior in a triclinic iron pnictide superconductor (Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with $T_c \approx $ 30 K, where the superconductivity is quasi-2D manifested by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behaviors. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments unambiguously reveal a spin resonance peak around $E_R =$ 13 meV in the superconducting state, but its intensity continuously decreases when warming up across $T_c$, accompanied with an anomaly around $T^{*}\approx$ 45 K in spin correlations, and a suppression by an in-plane magnetic field persisting to the same temperature. Below $T^{*}$, a significant Nernst signal and a reduction of density of states at the Fermi level are also observed. These results suggest that the precursor of spin resonance is highly related to the preformed Cooper pairs driven by phase fluctuations, much like the pseudogap case in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric bulk NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising superconductivity allows in-plane upper critical magnetic fields to vastly surpass Pauli limit by locking the antiparallel electron spins of Cooper pairs in the out-of-plane direction. It was first explicitly demonstrated in fully two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with large spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Since then, several studies have shown that it can be present in layered bulk materials, too. In our previous study, we have clarified the underlying microscopic mechanism of Ising superconductivity in bulk, based on a reduced electronic coupling between superconducting layers due to intercalation by insulating layers and restricted inversion symmetry. But earlier studies suggest that in some transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes Pauli paramagnetic limit is violated even without intercalation. Here, using heat capacity measurements we unambiguously demonstrate, that the pristine noncentrosymmetric bulk 4Ha-NbSe2 polytype significantly violates the Pauli limit. The band structure parameters obtained from ab initio calculations using the experimentally determined crystal structure are used in the theoretical model which provides the microscopic mechanism of the Ising protection based solely on broken inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.</description>

      <title>The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary-induced Majorana coupling in a planar topological Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that geometric curvature and torsion may be used to probe the quality of an uncompensated antiferromagnetic interface, using the proximity effect. We study a helix of antiferromagnetic wire coupled to a conventional superconductor, and show that a density of states measurement can give information about the quality of an uncompensated interface, crucial for many recently predicted antiferromagnetic proximity effects. Furthermore, we show that geometric curvature alone can result in long-ranged superconducting triplet correlations in the antiferromagnet, and we discuss the impact curvature and torsion can have on the future development of superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using linear response, an exact path integral technique and symmetry considerations. All three approaches independently lead to conclude that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from assuming it would not. We also explain why the RSJ physics differs from that of 1D quantum impurity problems. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</description>
