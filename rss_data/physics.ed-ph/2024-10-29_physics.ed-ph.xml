      <title>Qureka! Box -- An ENSAR methodology based tool for understanding quantum computing concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As nations and organisations worldwide intensify their efforts and investments to commercialise quantum technologies and explore practical applications across various industries, there is a burgeoning demand for skilled professionals to support this rapidly growing ecosystem. With an expanding array of stakeholders from diverse professions beginning to engage with this ecosystem, there is an urgent need for innovative educational methodologies. These methodologies must not only convey the intricate principles of quantum mechanics effectively to varied professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions but also spark interest among students to delve into and pursue careers within this cutting-edge field. In response, we introduce the Experience-Name-Speak-Apply-Repeat (ENSAR) methodology, coupled with its hands-on implementation through the Qureka Box - an innovative tool designed to demystify quantum computing for a diverse audience by emphasising a pedagogical approach rooted in experiential learning, conceptual understanding, and practical application. We present the results of deploying the ENSAR methodology using the Qureka Box across a diverse group to validate our claims. The findings suggest a significant enhancement in the participants' grasp of foundational quantum computing concepts, thereby showcasing the potential of this approach to equip individuals from diverse professional backgrounds with the knowledge and skills to bridge the workforce demand.</description>
