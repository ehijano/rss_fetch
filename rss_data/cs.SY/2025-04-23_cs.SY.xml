      <title>A Quadratic Control Framework for Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories.
  For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy.
  To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities.
  To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Safety Embedded Adaptive Control Using Barrier States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the application of barrier states (BaS) in the realm of safe nonlinear adaptive control. Our proposed framework derives barrier states for systems with parametric uncertainty, which are augmented into the uncertain dynamical model. We employ an adaptive nonlinear control strategy based on a control Lyapunov functions approach to design a stabilizing controller for the augmented system. The developed theory shows that the controller ensures safe control actions for the original system while meeting specified performance objectives. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on diverse systems, including a planar quadrotor subject to unknown drag forces and an adaptive cruise control system, for which we provide comparisons with existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Nonlinear Safe Control with BaS-SDRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach has emerged as a systematic and effective means of designing nearly optimal nonlinear controllers. The Barrier States (BaS) embedding methodology was developed recently for safe multi-objective controls in which the safety condition is manifested as a state to be controlled along with other states of the system. The overall system, termed the safety embedded system, is highly nonlinear even if the original system is linear. This paper develops a nonlinear nearly optimal safe feedback control technique by combining the two strategies effectively. First, the BaS is derived in an extended linearization formulation to be subsequently used to form an extended safety embedded system. A new optimal control problem is formed thereafter, which is used to construct a safety embedded State-Dependent Riccati Equation, termed BaS-SDRE, whose solution approximates the solution of the optimal control problem's associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The BaS-SDRE is then solved online to synthesize the nearly optimal safe control. The proposed technique's efficacy is demonstrated on an unstable, constrained linear system that shows how the synthesized control reacts to nonlinearities near the unsafe region, a nonlinear flight control system with limited path angular velocity that exists due to structural and dynamic concerns, and a planar quadrotor system that navigates safely in a crowded environment.</description>

      <title>Explicit Ensemble Mean Clock Synchronization for Optimal Atomic Time Scale Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for atomic time scale generation, called explicit ensemble mean synchronization, which unifies clock synchronization and time scale generation within a control-theoretic paradigm. By exploiting an observable canonical decomposition of a standard atomic clock ensemble model, the system is decomposed into two complementary components: the observable part, which represents the synchronization deviation, and the unobservable part, which captures the synchronization destination. Within this structure, we mathematically prove that standard Kalman filtering, widely used in current time scale generation, can be interpreted as a special case of the proposed framework that optimizes long-term frequency stability in terms of the Allan variance. Furthermore, by applying appropriate state feedback control to each component based on the Kalman filtering, both clock synchronization and optimal time scale generation are achieved within a unified framework. This framework provides a principled basis for robust timekeeping systems that goes beyond conventional approaches in both scope and performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Optimal Design of Experiment for Parameter Identification of Li-Ion Cell Electrochemical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately identifying the parameters of electrochemical models of li-ion battery (LiB) cells is a critical task for enhancing the fidelity and predictive ability. Traditional parameter identification methods often require extensive data collection experiments and lack adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper describes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that dynamically tailors the current profile applied to a LiB cell to optimize the parameters identifiability of the electrochemical model. The proposed framework is implemented in real-time using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup, which serves as a reliable testbed for evaluating the RL-based design strategy. The HIL validation confirms that the RL-based experimental design outperforms conventional test protocols used for parameter identification in terms of both reducing the modeling errors on a verification test and minimizing the duration of the experiment used for parameter identification.</description>

      <title>An ACO-MPC Framework for Energy-Efficient and Collision-Free Path Planning in Autonomous Maritime Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated driving on ramps presents significant challenges due to the need to balance both safety and efficiency during lane changes. This paper proposes an integrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an unsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for safety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking into account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency. Additionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to evaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive simulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient and safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can effectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe lane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the maneuver.</description>

      <title>On relaxing the N-Reachability Implicit Requirement in NMPC Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a proof of stability for Model Predictive Control formulations involving a prediction horizon that might be too short to meet the reachability condition generally invoked as a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. This condition is replaced by a contraction condition on the stage cost. But unlike the contraction based existing formulations where the prediction horizon becomes a decision variable, the formulation proposed in this paper remains standard in that it uses constant and short prediction horizon. An illustrative example is provided to assess the relevance of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Distributed model predictive control without terminal cost under inexact distributed optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed model predictive control (MPC) formulation without terminal cost and a corresponding distributed synthesis approach for distributed linear discrete-time systems with coupled constraints. The proposed control scheme introduces an explicit stability condition as an additional constraint based on relaxed dynamic programming. As a result, contrary to other related approaches, system stability with the developed controller does not rely on designing a terminal cost. A distributed synthesis approach is then introduced to handle the stability constraint locally within each local agent. To solve the underlying optimization problem for distributed MPC, a violation-free distributed optimization approach is developed, using constraint tightening to ensure feasibility throughout iterations. A numerical example demonstrates that the proposed distributed MPC approach ensures closed-loop stability for each feasible control sequence, with each agent computing its control input in parallel.</description>

      <title>A Point-Hyperplane Geometry Method for Operational Security Region of Renewable Energy Generation in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy generation challenges the secure operation of power systems. It becomes crucial to quantify the critical security boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the system operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry (PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational security region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the geometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a polytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the system operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is proposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on intersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane iteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric polytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in power systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by modifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes. Finally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PHG method.</description>

      <title>Finite time max-consensus for simultaneous target interception in switching graph topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed guidance law for the simultaneous interception of a stationary target. For a group of `n' heterogeneous pursuers, the proposed guidance law establishes the necessary conditions on static graphs that ensure simultaneous target interception, regardless of the initial conditions of the pursuers. Building on these results, we also establish the necessary conditions for achieving simultaneous interception in switching graph topologies as well. The major highlight of the work is that the target interception occurs in finite time for both static and switching graph topologies. We demonstrate all of these results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.</description>

      <title>Predictive Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions and its Application to Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic method for synthesizing a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that encodes predictive information into a CBF. Unlike other methods, the synthesized CBF can account for changes and time-variations in the constraints even when constructed for time-invariant constraints. This avoids recomputing the CBF when the constraint specifications change. The method provides an explicit characterization of the extended class K function {\alpha} that determines the dynamic properties of the CBF, and {\alpha} can even be explicitly chosen as a design parameter in the controller synthesis. The resulting CBF further accounts for input constraints, and its values can be determined at any point without having to compute the CBF over the entire domain. The synthesis method is based on a finite horizon optimal control problem inspired by Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and does not rely on a nominal control law. The synthesized CBF is time-invariant if the constraints are. The method poses mild assumptions on the controllability of the dynamic system and assumes the knowledge of at least a subset of some control invariant set. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the properties of the synthesized CBF, including its application to time-varying constraints. A simulation study applies the proposed approach to various dynamic systems in the presence of time-varying constraints. The paper is accompanied by an online available parallelized implementation of the proposed synthesis method.</description>

      <title>Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems based on Gaussian processes. Finite-length trajectories of the system are modeled as random vectors from a Gaussian distribution, which we call a Gaussian behavior. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian process and measurement noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance under the assumption that the measured trajectories are from independent experiments. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control (SPC) is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.</description>

      <title>Monocular inspection of spacecraft under illumination constraints and avoidance regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive control approach to information-based guidance and control of a spacecraft carrying out on-orbit inspection by actively computing optimal policies for the spacecraft to achieve the best possible representation of objects within its orbital environment. Due to the complexity of navigating the space environment, it may be impossible to carry out on-orbit servicing to maintain space systems like satellites using a spacecraft equipped with controllers that cannot adapt to changing conditions. In particular, the presence of constraints such as illumination, field-of-view (FOV), minimal fuel, the use of visual-inertial navigation for improved localization, and the need for real-time computation of control policies render the spacecraft motion planning problem challenging. The control framework developed in this paper addresses these challenges by formulating the inspection task as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to maximize information gained from the cameras, while navigating to the next best view, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. The developed architecture is analyzed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis and the effectiveness of the planning algorithm is verified in simulation.</description>

      <title>Hessian Riemannian Flow For Multi-Population Wardrop Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing flows on generalized graphs that feature multiple entry points and multiple populations, each with varying cost structures. We tackle this problem by considering the multi-population Wardrop equilibrium, defined through variational inequalities. We rigorously analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Wardrop equilibrium. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient numerical method to find the solution. In particular, we reformulate the equilibrium problem as a distributed optimization problem over subgraphs and introduce a novel Hessian Riemannian flow method, a Riemannian-manifold-projected Hessian flow, to efficiently compute a solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples in urban traffic management, including routing for diverse vehicle types and strategies for minimizing emissions in congested environments.</description>

Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers iteratively drive a plant to an optimal operating point that satisfies input and output constraints, relying solely on the input-output sensitivity as model information. This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>SLAM-Based Navigation and Fault Resilience in a Surveillance Quadcopter with Embedded Vision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial surveillance platform, Veg, designed as a fault-tolerant quadcopter system that integrates visual SLAM for GPS-independent navigation, advanced control architecture for dynamic stability, and embedded vision modules for real-time object and face recognition. The platform features a cascaded control design with an LQR inner-loop and PD outer-loop trajectory control. It leverages ORB-SLAM3 for 6-DoF localization and loop closure, and supports waypoint-based navigation through Dijkstra path planning over SLAM-derived maps. A real-time Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system detects rotor faults and executes emergency landing through re-routing. The embedded vision system, based on a lightweight CNN and PCA, enables onboard object detection and face recognition with high precision. The drone operates fully onboard using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Nano, validated through simulations and real-world testing. This work consolidates real-time localization, fault recovery, and embedded AI on a single platform suitable for constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Safe Planner for Automated Driving on Ramps Considering Unsatisfication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving on ramps presents significant challenges due to the need to balance both safety and efficiency during lane changes. This paper proposes an integrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an unsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for safety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking into account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency. Additionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to evaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive simulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient and safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can effectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe lane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the maneuver.</description>

      <title>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two notions of barrier certificates that use multiple functions to provide a lower bound on the probabilistic satisfaction of safety for stochastic dynamical systems. A barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system acts as a nonnegative supermartingale, and provides a lower bound on the probability that the system is safe. The promise of such certificates is that their search can be effectively automated. Typically, one may use optimization or SMT solvers to find such barrier certificates of a given fixed template. When such approaches fail, a typical approach is to instead change the template. We propose an alternative approach that we dub interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. An interpolation-inspired barrier certificate consists of a set of functions that jointly provide a lower bound on the probability of satisfying safety. We show how one may find such certificates of a fixed template, even when we fail to find standard barrier certificates of the same template. However, we note that such certificates still need to ensure a supermartingale guarantee for one function in the set. To address this challenge, we consider the use of $k$-induction with these interpolation-inspired certificates. The recent use of $k$-induction in barrier certificates allows one to relax the supermartingale requirement at every time step to a combination of a supermartingale requirement every $k$ steps and a $c$-martingale requirement for the intermediate steps. We provide a generic formulation of a barrier certificate that we dub $k$-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. The formulation allows for several combinations of interpolation and $k$-induction for barrier certificate. We present two examples among the possible combinations. We finally present sum-of-squares programming to synthesize this set of functions and demonstrate their utility in case studies.</description>

      <title>MRTA-Sim: A Modular Simulator for Multi-Robot Allocation, Planning, and Control in Open-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MRTA-Sim, a Python/ROS2/Gazebo simulator for testing approaches to Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems on simulated robots in complex, indoor environments. Grid-based approaches to MRTA problems can be too restrictive for use in complex, dynamic environments such in warehouses, department stores, hospitals, etc. However, approaches that operate in free-space often operate at a layer of abstraction above the control and planning layers of a robot and make an assumption on approximate travel time between points of interest in the system. These abstractions can neglect the impact of the tight space and multi-agent interactions on the quality of the solution. Therefore, MRTA solutions should be tested with the navigation stacks of the robots in mind, taking into account robot planning, conflict avoidance between robots, and human interaction and avoidance. This tool connects the allocation output of MRTA solvers to individual robot planning using the NAV2 stack and local, centralized multi-robot deconfliction using Control Barrier Function-Quadrtic Programs (CBF-QPs), creating a platform closer to real-world operation for more comprehensive testing of these approaches. The simulation architecture is modular so that users can swap out methods at different levels of the stack. We show the use of our system with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based approach to dynamic MRTA on a fleet of indoor delivery robots.</description>

      <title>LAPP: Large Language Model Feedback for Preference-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Large Language Model-Assisted Preference Prediction (LAPP), a novel framework for robot learning that enables efficient, customizable, and expressive behavior acquisition with minimum human effort. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on reward engineering, human demonstrations, motion capture, or expensive pairwise preference labels, LAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate preference labels from raw state-action trajectories collected during reinforcement learning (RL). These labels are used to train an online preference predictor, which in turn guides the policy optimization process toward satisfying high-level behavioral specifications provided by humans. Our key technical contribution is the integration of LLMs into the RL feedback loop through trajectory-level preference prediction, enabling robots to acquire complex skills including subtle control over gait patterns and rhythmic timing. We evaluate LAPP on a diverse set of quadruped locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks and show that it achieves efficient learning, higher final performance, faster adaptation, and precise control of high-level behaviors. Notably, LAPP enables robots to master highly dynamic and expressive tasks such as quadruped backflips, which remain out of reach for standard LLM-generated or handcrafted rewards. Our results highlight LAPP as a promising direction for scalable preference-driven robot learning.</description>

      <title>A Sensor-Driven Optimization Framework for Asset Management in Energy Systems: Implications for Full and Partial Digital Transformation in Hydro Fleets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&amp;M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&amp;M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&amp;M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&amp;M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&amp;M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of indoor navigation has witnessed groundbreaking advancements through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional navigation approaches relying on pre-built maps or reinforcement learning exhibit limitations such as poor generalization and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, LLMs offer a novel paradigm for complex indoor navigation tasks by leveraging their exceptional semantic comprehension, reasoning capabilities, and zero-shot generalization properties. We propose an LLM-based navigation framework that leverages function calling capabilities, positioning the LLM as the central controller. Our methodology involves modular decomposition of conventional navigation functions into reusable LLM tools with expandable configurations. This is complemented by a systematically designed, transferable system prompt template and interaction workflow that can be easily adapted across different implementations. Experimental validation in PyBullet simulation environments across diverse scenarios demonstrates the substantial potential and effectiveness of our approach, particularly in achieving context-aware navigation through dynamic tool composition.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-$k^2$: Helmholtz Equation Informed Generative Diffusion Model for Multi-Path Aware Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed generative learning approach, termed RadioDiff-$\bm{k^2}$, for accurate and efficient multipath-aware radio map (RM) construction. As wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, driven by the increasing demand for intelligent and proactive optimization in sixth-generation (6G) networks, accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although, existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. Based on this insight, we design an innovative dual generative diffusion model (DM) framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Our physics-informed approach uniquely combines the efficiency advantages of data-driven methods with rigorous physics-based EM modeling, significantly enhancing RM accuracy, particularly in complex propagation environments dominated by multipath effects.</description>

      <title>Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\^{o} diffusion ${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}} t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.</description>

      <title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</description>

      <title>Continuity Conditions for Piecewise Quadratic Functions on Simplicial Conic Partitions are Equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear (PWL) systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. A key element in our proof is a technical lemma, which, in addition to being of independent interest, plays a crucial role in demonstrating the equivalence of these conditions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Fault-tolerant Control of Underwater Vehicles with Thruster Failures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fault-tolerant control for the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) against thruster failures. We formulate faults in AUV thrusters as discrete switching events during a UAV mission, and develop a soft-switching approach in facilitating shift of control strategies across fault scenarios. We mathematically define AUV thruster fault scenarios, and develop the fault-tolerant control that captures the fault scenario via Bayesian approach. Particularly, when the AUV fault type switches from one to another, the developed control captures the fault states and maintains the control by a linear quadratic tracking controller. With the captured fault states by Bayesian approach, we derive the control law by aggregating the control outputs for individual fault scenarios weighted by their Bayesian posterior probability. The developed fault-tolerant control works in an adaptive way and guarantees soft-switching across fault scenarios, and requires no complicated fault detection dedicated to different type of faults. The entailed soft-switching ensures stable AUV trajectory tracking when fault type shifts, which otherwise leads to reduced control under hard-switching control strategies. We conduct numerical simulations with diverse AUV thruster fault settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can provide smooth transition across thruster failures, and effectively sustain AUV trajectory tracking control in case of thruster failures and failure shifts.</description>

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, the field of process industry optimization and control is also undergoing a digital transformation. With the rise of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), its application in process control has attracted widespread attention. However, the extremely low sample efficiency and the safety concerns caused by exploration in DRL hinder its practical implementation in industrial settings. Transfer learning offers an effective solution for DRL, enhancing its generalization and adaptability in multi-mode control scenarios. This paper provides insights into the use of DRL for process control from the perspective of transfer learning.

      <title>Robust, positive and exact model reduction via monotone matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of exact model reduction of positive linear systems, by leveraging minimal realization theory. While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Discrete Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter demonstrates how synthetic inertia can be obtained with the control of flexible discrete devices to keep the power balance of power systems, even if the system does not include any synchronous generator or conventional grid-forming converter. The letter also discusses solutions to cycling issues, which can arise due to the interaction of uncoordinated discrete inertia controllers. The effectiveness, dynamic performance, and challenges of the proposed approach are validated through simulations using modified versions of the WSCC 9-bus test system and of the all-island Irish transmission system.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of connected automated vehicle (CAV) is advocated to mitigate traffic oscillations in mixed traffic flow consisting of CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) for regulating mixed traffic flow. Firstly, a Koopman theory-based adaptive trajectory prediction deep network (AdapKoopnet) is designed for modeling HDVs car-following behavior. AdapKoopnet enables the representation of HDVs behavior by a linear model in a high-dimensional space. Secondly, the model predictive control is employed to smooth the mixed traffic flow, where the combination of the linear dynamic model of CAVs and linear prediction blocks from AdapKoopnet is embedded as the predictive model into the AdapKoopPC. Finally, the predictive performance of the prosed AdapKoopnet is verified using the HighD naturalistic driving dataset. Furthermore, the control performance of AdapKoopPC is validated by the numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the AdapKoopnet provides more accuracy HDVs predicted trajectories than the baseline nonlinear models. Moreover, the proposed AdapKoopPC exhibits more effective control performance with less computation cost compared with baselines in mitigating traffic oscillations, especially at the low CAVs penetration rates. The code of proposed AdapKoopPC is open source.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Predictive Control: Introductory Algebraic Calculations, and a Comparison with HEOL and ANNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control engineering practice, but requires a sound knowledge of the model. Model-free predictive control (MFPC), a burning issue today, also related to reinforcement learning (RL) in AI, is reformulated here via a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, thanks to a new perspective on optimal control combined with recent advances in the field of model-free control (MFC). It is replacing Dynamic Programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The computing burden is low. The implementation is straightforward. Two nonlinear examples, a chemical reactor and a two tank system, are illustrating our approach. A comparison with the HEOL setting, where some expertise of the process model is needed, shows only a slight superiority of the later. A recent identification of the two tank system via a complex ANN architecture might indicate that a full modeling and the corresponding machine learning mechanism are not always necessary neither in control, nor, more generally, in AI.</description>

      <title>Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme, for which two methods are proposed. Firstly, the controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Secondly, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with a parametrized NMPC as a function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters' divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of System Poles for Ho-Kalman Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the error analysis of system pole estimation in $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant systems with $m$ outputs and $p$ inputs, using the classical Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input-output sample data. Building upon prior work, we establish end-to-end estimation guarantees for system poles under both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory settings. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error of system poles decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}\{T^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the single-trajectory case and $\mathcal{O}\{N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the multiple-trajectory case, where $T$ is the length of a single trajectory, and $N$ is the number of trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation accuracy for system poles requires the sample size to grow super-polynomially with respect to the larger of the two ratios, $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Communication of Distributed Model Predictive Control: Autoencoders and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in wireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of information exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length of the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant length to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to provide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the size of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the communicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to communication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the distributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice of a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the data, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control problems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation control of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for optimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and which is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a simulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a satisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the canonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the prediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted on embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and wireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing communication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.</description>

      <title>Considerations on the Design of Transceivers for Ambient Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ambient IoT (A-IoT) will introduce trillions of connections and enable low-cost battery-less devices. The A-IoT nodes can achieve low cost ($\sim\$ 0.1$ like RFID tag), sub-1mW average power consumption, $\leq 10$ kbps data rates, maintenance-free working for decades, cm-scale size, and support applications like supply chain and smart agriculture. The transceiver challenges in A-IoT focus on sub-mW receivers and crystal-less clock generation. The paper proposes an approximate low-IF receiver and carrier-auxiliary IF feedback LO synthesizer architecture for Type-B/C A-IoT devices, which tracks the RF carrier frequency and eliminates external crystals. The proposed receiver and LO generator are implemented using 55nm CMOS technology. After locking the LO calibration loop, the receiver sensitivity is better than -88 dBm. The proposed receiver architecture will promote zero-power devices for ubiquitous IoT connectivity, bridging digital and physical worlds.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Games on Infinite Strategy Sets: Convergence to Nash Equilibria via Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary dynamics for population games in which players have a continuum of strategies at their disposal. Models in this setting amount to infinite-dimensional differential equations evolving on the manifold of probability measures. We generalize dissipativity theory for evolutionary games from finite to infinite strategy sets that are compact metric spaces, and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of Nash equilibria under the infinite-dimensional dynamics. The resulting analysis is applicable to a broad class of evolutionary games, and is modular in the sense that the pertinent conditions on the dynamics and the game's payoff structure can be verified independently. By specializing our theory to the class of monotone games, we recover as special cases existing stability results for the Brown-von Neumann-Nash and impartial pairwise comparison dynamics. We also extend our theory to models with dynamic payoffs, further broadening the applicability of our framework. Throughout our analyses, we identify and elaborate on new technical conditions that are key in extending dissipativity theory from finite to infinite strategy sets, such as compactness of the set of Nash equilibria and evolution of dynamic payoffs within a compact positively invariant set. We illustrate our theory using a variety of case studies, including a novel, continuous variant of the war of attrition game.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Soft-Maximum Barrier Functions for Safety in Unmapped and Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form optimal feedback control method that ensures safety in an a prior unknown and potentially dynamic environment. This article considers the scenario where local perception data (e.g., LiDAR) is obtained periodically, and this data can be used to construct a local control barrier function (CBF) that models a local set that is safe for a period of time into the future. Then, we use a smooth time-varying soft-maximum function to compose the N most recently obtained local CBFs into a single barrier function that models an approximate union of the N most recently obtained local sets. This composite barrier function is used in a constrained quadratic optimization, which is solved in closed form to obtain a safe-and-optimal feedback control. We also apply the time-varying soft-maximum barrier function control to 2 robotic systems (nonholonomic ground robot with nonnegligible inertia, and quadrotor robot), where the objective is to navigate an a priori unknown environment safely and reach a target destination. In these applications, we present a simple approach to generate local CBFs from periodically obtained perception data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projection-based regularization for efficient model augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box models lack physical interpretability, and a considerable part of the learning effort is often spent on capturing already expected/known behavior of the system, that can be accurately described by first-principles laws of physics. A potential solution is to directly integrate such prior physical knowledge into the model structure, combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification. The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel, i.e., additively. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging, potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization technique to enhance parameter learning and even model accuracy in learning-based augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12594495.</description>

Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bayesian Affine Estimator and Active Learning for the Wiener Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian estimation framework for Wiener models, focusing on learning nonlinear output functions under known linear state dynamics. We derive a closed-form optimal affine estimator for the unknown parameters, characterized by the so-called "dynamic basis statistics" (DBS). Several features of the proposed estimator are studied, including Bayesian unbiasedness, closed-form posterior statistics, error monotonicity in trajectory length, and consistency condition (also known as persistent excitation). In the special case of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate that the closed-form description is computationally available, as the Fourier DBS enjoys explicit expressions. Furthermore, we identify an inherent inconsistency in the Fourier bases for single-trajectory measurements, regardless of the input excitation. Leveraging the closed-form estimation error, we develop an active learning algorithm synthesizing input signals to minimize estimation error. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showing significant improvements over traditional regularized least-squares methods.</description>

      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>
