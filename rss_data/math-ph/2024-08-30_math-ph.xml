      <title>Two-dimensional Fireballs as a Lagrangian Ermakov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of motion for the variance of strictly one-dimensional or two-dimensional non-relativistic fireballs are derived, from the hydrodynamic equations for an ideal, structureless Boltzmann gas. For this purpose a Gaussian number density {\it Ansatz} is applied, together with low-dimensional proposals for the energy density, coherent with the equipartition theorem. The resulting ordinary differential equations are shown to admit a variational formulation. The underlying symmetries are connected to constants of motion, through Noether's theorem. The two-dimensional case is special, corresponding to a Lagrangian Ermakov system without external forcing. There is a comparison with the fully three-dimensional fireballs, and its reduction to effective two-dimensional dynamical system for elliptic trajectories. The exact analytical solutions are worked out.</description>

      <title>Small deviations of Gaussian multiplicative chaos and the free energy of the two-dimensional massless Sinh--Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new small deviations bounds for a class of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures obtained from Gaussian fields with zero spatial average. The upper bound holds for a class of fields closely related to the $\star$-scale invariant Gaussian fields in arbitrary number of dimensions, and the lower bound holds for the Gaussian free field with zero spatial average on the torus. The upper bound is obtained by a modification of the method that was used in \cite{LRV}, and the lower bound is obtained by applying the Donsker--Varadhan variational formula.
  We also give the probabilistic path integral formulation of the massless Sinh--Gordon model on a torus of side length $R$, and study its partition function $R$ tends to infinity. We apply the small deviation bounds for Gaussian multiplicative chaos to obtain lower and upper bounds for the logarithm of the partition function, leading to the existence of a non-zero and finite subsequential infinite volume limit for the free energy.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy and Mutual Information in Gaussian Statistical Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15548v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a powerful measure of the dissimilarity between two statistical field theories in the continuum. In this work, we study the relative entropy between Gaussian scalar field theories in a finite volume with different masses and boundary conditions. We show that the relative entropy depends crucially on $d$, the dimension of Euclidean space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mutual information between two disjoint regions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is finite if the two regions are separated by a finite distance and satisfies an area law. We then construct an example of "touching" regions between which the mutual information is infinite. We argue that the properties of mutual information in scalar field theories can be explained by the Markov property of these theories.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, correlation functions, and entanglement of general quantum Motzkin spin-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motzkin spin-chains, which include 'colorless' (integer spin $s=1$) and 'colorful' ($s \geq 2$) variants, are one-dimensional (1D) local integer spin models notable for their lack of a conformal field theory (CFT) description of their low-energy physics, despite being gapless. The colorful variants are particularly unusual, as they exhibit power-law violation of the area-law of entanglement entropy (as $\sqrt{n}$ in system size $n$), rather than a logarithmic violation as seen in a CFT. In this work, we analytically discover several unique properties of these models, potentially suggesting a new universality class for their low-energy physics. We identify a complex structure of symmetries and unexpected scaling behavior in spin-spin correlations, which deviate from known 1D universality classes. Specifically, the $s=1$ chain exhibits $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking and ferromagnetic order. Meanwhile, the $s \geq 2$ chains do not appear to spontaneously break any symmetries, but display quasi-long-range algebraic order with power-law decaying correlations, inconsistent with standard Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical exponents. We also derive exact asymptotic scaling expressions for entanglement measures in both colorless and colorful chains, generalizing previous results of Movassagh [J. Math Phys. (2017)], while providing benchmarks for potential quantum simulation experiments. The combination of hardness of classically simulating such systems along with the analytical tractability of their ground state properties position Motzkin spin chains as intriguing candidates for exploring quantum computational advantage in simulating many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Influence of gauges in the numerical simulation of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) model requires the choice of a gauge for the problem to be mathematically well-posed. In the literature, three gauges are commonly used: the Coulomb gauge, the Lorenz gauge and the temporal gauge. It has been noticed [J. Fleckinger-Pell\'e et al., Technical report, Argonne National Lab. (1997)] that these gauges can be continuously related by a single parameter considering the more general $\omega$-gauge, where $\omega$ is a non-negative real parameter. In this article, we study the influence of the gauge parameter $\omega$ on the convergence of numerical simulations of the TDGL model using finite element schemes. A classical benchmark is first analysed for different values of $\omega$ and artefacts are observed for lower values of $\omega$. Then, we relate these observations with a systematic study of convergence orders in the unified $\omega$-gauge framework. In particular, we show the existence of a tipping point value for $\omega$, separating optimal convergence behaviour and a degenerate one. We find that numerical artefacts are correlated to the degeneracy of the convergence order of the method and we suggest strategies to avoid such undesirable effects. New 3D configurations are also investigated (the sphere with or without geometrical defect).</description>

      <title>On the intertwining map between Coulomb and hyperbolic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unitary operator between Hilbert spaces of generalized eigenfunctions of Coulomb operators and the Laplace-Beltrami operator of hyperbolic space that intertwines their respective Poisson operators on $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$. The constructed operator generalizes Fock's unitary transformation, originally defined between the discrete spectra of the attractive Coulomb operator and the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere, to the setting of continuous spectra. Among other connections, this map explains why the scattering matrices are the same in these two different settings, and it also provides an explicit formula for the Poisson operator of the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Steady Compressible 3D Euler Flows in Toroidal Volumes without Continuous Euclidean Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of smooth three-dimensional vector fields where the cross product between the vector field and its curl is balanced by the gradient of a smooth function, with toroidal level sets that are not invariant under continuous Euclidean isometries. This finding indicates the existence of steady compressible Euler flows, either influenced by an external potential energy or maintained by a density source in the continuity equation, that are foliated by asymmetric nested toroidal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that the primary obstacle in resolving Grad's conjecture regarding the existence of nontrivial magnetohydrodynamic equilibria arises from the incompressibility constraint imposed on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>On the physical and mathematical foundations of quantum physics via functional integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to preserve the leading role of the action principle in formulating all field theories one needs quantum field theory, with the associated BRST symmetry, and Feynman-DeWitt-Faddeev-Popov ghost fields. Such fields result from the fibre-bundle structure of the space of histories, but the physics-oriented literature used them formally because a rigorous theory of measure and integration was lacking. Motivated by this framework, this paper exploits previous work of Gill and Zachary, where the use of Banach spaces for the Feynman integral was proposed. The Henstock-Kurzweil integral is first introduced, because it makes it possible to integrate functions like the exponential of (i times x squared). The Lebesgue measure on R(infinity) is then built and used to define the measure on every separable Hilbert space. The subsequent step is the construction of a new Hilbert space KS2, which contains square-integrable functions on R**n as a continuous dense embedding, and contains both the test functions and their dual, the Schwartz space of distributions, as continuous embeddings. This space allows us to construct the Feynman path integral in a manner that maintains its intuitive and computational advantages. We also extend this space to KS2[H], where H is any separable Banach space. Last, the existence of a unique universal definition of time, tau(h), that we call historical time, is proved. We use tau(h) as the order parameter for our construction of Feynman's time ordered operator calculus, which in turn is used to extend the path integral in order to include all time dependent groups and semigroups with a kernel.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar Variational Model for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. We develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we prove that $|R_c-R_\infty|\leq O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we show that the $L^\infty$-convergence rate of $|\rho_c-\rho_\infty|$ is not bigger than $O(\frac{1}{c^3})$ in the corner layer $B(R_\infty +\frac{K_1}{c^2})\setminus B(R_\infty -\frac{K_1}{c^2})\, (K_1&gt;0)$, while $L^\infty$-convergence rate of $|\rho_c-\rho_\infty|$ is not bigger than $O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ inside the corner layer $B(R_\infty -\frac{K_1}{c^2})$ for $N$ large enough.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples and discuss about the implications of these results for the 3+1 formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Lorentzian Sobolev calculus of Beran et al.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (and barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Solitons in 4d Wess-Zumino-Witten models -- Towards unification of integrable systems --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct soliton solutions of the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (4dWZW) model in the context of a unified theory of integrable systems with relation to the 4d/6d Chern-Simons theory. We calculate the action density of the solutions and find that the soliton solutions behave as the KP-type solitons, that is, the one-soliton solution has a localized action/energy density on a 3d hyperplane in 4-dimensions (soliton wall) and the n-soliton solution describes n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. We note that the Ward conjecture holds mostly in the split signature (+,+,-,-). Furthermore, the 4dWZW model describes the string field theory action of the open N=2 string theory in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature and hence our soliton solutions would describe a new-type of physical objects in the N=2 string theory. We discuss instanton solutions in the 4dWZW model as well. Noncommutative extension and quantization of the unified theory of integrable systems are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (=ASEP) with finitely many particles. It turns out that a certain randomized initial condition is the most amenable to such an analysis. Our main result is the behavior of such an ASEP in the KPZ limit regime. A key technical tool introduced in the paper -- the coloring of ASEP particles with the use of random Mallows permutations -- may be of independent interest.</description>

The origin lies in a finite open cluster with positive probability, and, when it does, the diameter of this cluster has an exponentially decaying tail. For each unit vector $\bf\ell$, we prove sharp asymptotics for the probability that this cluster contains a vertex $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfies $x \cdot \bf\ell \geq u$. For an axially aligned $\bf\ell$, we find this probability to be of the form $\kappa \exp \{ - \zeta u \}(1+ {\rm err})$ for $u \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\vert {\rm err} \vert$ is at most $C \exp \{ - c u^{1/2} \big\}$; for general $\bf\ell$, the form of the asymptotic depends on whether $\bf\ell$ satisfies a natural lattice condition. To obtain these results, we prove that renewal points in long clusters are abundant, with a renewal block length whose tail is shown to decay as fast as $C \exp \big\{ - c u^{1/2} \big\}$.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlations for the massless hierarchical Liouville model in infinite volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(A_v)_{v\in \mathcal{T}}$ be the balanced Gaussian Branching Random Walk on a $d$-ary tree $\mathcal{T}$ and let $M^A$ be the multiplicative chaos with parameter $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2\log d})$ constructed from $A$. In this work we establish the precise first order asymptotics of negative exponential moment of $M^A$, i.e.\ we prove that for $t_k = \lambda p_\gamma^k$ with $\lambda&gt;0$ and $p_\gamma$ an explicit constant depending only on $\gamma$, we have as $k \to \infty$, \begin{equation} -\frac{1}{d^k} \log \mathbb{E}[e^{-\lambda p_\gamma^k M^A } ] \to h(\lambda), \end{equation} where $h\colon (0,\infty)\to \mathbb{R}$ is a non-explicit positive continuous function.
  This result allows us to study the law of $A$ tilted by $e^{-t_k M^A}$ for particular values of $\lambda$, with $k\to \infty$. In this setting we prove that the normalized $L^1$ norm of $A$ in generation $k-a$ is bounded and converges to $0$ when first $k\to \infty$ and then $a\to 0$.
  As an application we prove that in this setting, under the tilt $e^{-t_k M^A}$ and with $k\to \infty$, the Branching Random Walk $A$ exhibits a weak decay of correlation, which is not present in the non-tilted model.
  Our methods also apply to the usual Branching Random Walk $(S_v)_{v\in \mathcal{T}}$ and with $M^A$ replaced by $\frac{1}{2}(M^+ + M^- )$, where $M^+$ and $M^-$ are the multiplicative chaoses with parameter $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2\log d})$ constructed from $S$ and $-S$. In that case we prove that, as $k\to \infty$, \begin{equation} -\frac{1}{d^k} \log \mathbb{E}[e^{- \frac{\lambda p_\gamma^k}{2}( M^+ + M^-) }] \to \tilde h(\lambda), \end{equation} where $\tilde h\colon (0,\infty)\to \mathbb{R}$ is again a non-explicit positive continuous function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted period integrals are ubiquitous in theoretical physics and mathematics, where they inhabit a finite-dimensional vector space governed by an inner product known as the intersection number. In this work, we uncover the associated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with the fibration method to develop a novel and efficient evaluation scheme. Companion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers in terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. Our algorithm has been successfully applied to the decomposition of two-loop five-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the direct projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a mixed Hodge structure on the topological K-theory of smooth Poisson varieties, depending weakly on a choice of compactification. We establish a package of tools for calculations with these structures, such as functoriality statements, projective bundle formulae, Gysin sequences and Torelli properties. We show that for varieties with trivial A-hat class, the corresponding period maps for families can be written as exponential maps for bundles of tori, which we call the "quantum parameters". As justification for the terminology, we show that in many interesting examples, the quantum parameters of a Poisson variety coincide with the parameters appearing in its known deformation quantizations. In particular, we give a detailed implementation of an argument of Kontsevich, to prove that his canonical quantization formula, when applied to Poisson tori, yields noncommutative tori with parameter "$q = e^\hbar$".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Movshev-Mason-Skinner Cauchy-Riemann (CR) ambitwistor approach, we provide a rigorous yet elementary construction of a twisted CR holomorphic Chern-Simons action on CR ambitwistor space for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional Euclidean space. The key ingredient in our discussion is the homotopy algebraic perspective on perturbative quantum field theory. Using this technology, we show that both theories are semi-classically equivalent, that is, we construct a quasi-isomorphism between the cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras governing both field theories. This confirms a conjecture from the literature. Furthermore, we also show that the Yang-Mills action is obtained by integrating out an infinite tower of auxiliary fields in the Chern-Simons action, that is, the two theories are related by homotopy transfer. Given its simplicity, this Chern-Simons action should form a fruitful starting point for analysing perturbative properties of Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterisation of Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum physics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory using classical concepts. In turn, understood as a resource for quantum computation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite its long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in quantum computation, the structural essence of contextuality has remained somewhat elusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the phenomenon, yet their precise relationship often remains unclear. This issue already looms large at the level of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem: while traditional proofs proceed by showing the nonexistence of valuations, the notion of state-independent contextuality in the marginal approach allows to prove contextuality from seemingly weaker assumptions. In the light of this, and at the absence of a unified mathematical framework for Kochen-Specker contextuality, the original algebraic approach has been widely abandoned, in favour of the study of contextual correlations.
  Here, we reinstate the algebraic perspective on contextuality. Concretely, by building on the novel concept of context connections, we reformulate the algebraic relations between observables originally postulated by Kochen and Specker, and we explicitly demonstrate their consistency with the notion of state-independent contextuality. In the present paper, we focus on the new conceptual ideas and discuss them in the concrete setting of spin-1 observables, specifically those in the example of [S. Yu and C.H. Oh, Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 030402 (2012)]; in a companion paper, we generalise these ideas, obtain a complete characterisation of Kochen-Specker contextuality and provide a detailed comparison with the related notions of contextuality in the marginal and graph-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Translationally Invariant Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equations in the High Field Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large field limit in Schr\"odinger equations with magnetic vector potentials describing translationally invariant $B$-fields with respect to the $z$-axis. In a first step, using regular perturbation theory, we derive an approximate description of the solution, provided the initial data is compactly supported in the Fourier-variable dual to $z\in \mathbb R$. The effective dynamics is thereby seen to produce high-frequency oscillations and large magnetic drifts. In a second step we show, by using the theory of almost invariant subspaces, that this asymptotic description is stable under polynomially bounded perturbations that vanish in the vicinity of the origin.</description>

      <title>Liouville quantum gravity weighted by conformal loop ensemble nesting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces whose law has been reweighted according to nesting statistics for a conformal loop ensemble (CLE) relative to $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$ marked points $z_1,\dots,z_n$. The idea is to consider a reweighting by $\prod_{B\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}} e^{\sigma_B N_B}$, where $\sigma_B\in\mathbb{R}$ and $N_B$ is the number of CLE loops surrounding the points $z_i$ for $i\in B$. This is made precise via an approximation procedure where as part of the proof we derive strong spatial independence results for CLE. The reweighting induces logarithmic singularities for the Liouville field at $z_1,\dots,z_n$ with a magnitude depending explicitly on $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$. We define the partition function of the surface, compute it for $n\in\{0,1\}$, and derive a recursive formula expressing the $n&gt;1$ point partition function in terms of lower-order partition functions. The proof of the latter result is based on a continuum peeling process previously studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner in the case $n=0$, and we derive an explicit formula for the generator of a boundary length process that can be associated with the exploration for general $n$. We use the recursive formula to partly characterize for which values of $(\sigma_B\colon B\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\})$ the partition function is finite. Finally, we give a new proof for the law of the conformal radius of CLE, which was originally established by Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson.</description>

Abstract: This is a joint introduction to classical and free probability, which are twin sisters. We first review the foundations of classical probability, notably with the main limiting theorems (CLT, CCLT, PLT, CPLT), and with a look into examples coming from Lie groups and random matrices. Then we present the foundations and main results of free probability, notably with free limiting theorems, and with a look into examples coming from quantum groups and random matrices. We discuss then a number of more advanced aspects, in relation with free geometry and with subfactor theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum field theory (QFT) of a scalar field in the Schr\"odinger picture in the functional formulation.
  We derive a formula for the evolution kernel in a flat expanding metric. We discuss a transition between Riemannian and pseudoRiemannian metrics (signature inversion). We express the real time Schr\"odinger evolution by the Brownian motion . We discuss the Feynman integral for a scalar field in a radiation background. We show that the unitary Schr\"odinger evolution for positive time can go over for negative time into a dissipative evolution described by diffusive paths.</description>

      <title>From zero-mode intermittency to hidden symmetry in random scalar advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical behavior of scalars passively advected by random flows exhibits intermittency in the form of anomalous multiscaling, in many ways similar to the patterns commonly observed in incompressible high-Reynolds fluids. This similarity suggests a generic dynamical mechanism underlying intermittency, though its specific nature remains unclear. Scalar turbulence is framed in a linear setting that points towards a zero-mode scenario connecting anomalous scaling to the presence of statistical conservation laws; the duality is fully substantiated within Kraichnan theory of random flows. However, extending the zero-mode scenario to nonlinear settings faces formidable technical challenges. Here, we revisit the scalar problem in the light of a hidden symmetry scenario introduced in recent deterministic turbulence studies addressing the Sabra shell model and the Navier-Stokes equations. Hidden symmetry uses a rescaling strategy based entirely on symmetry considerations, transforming the original dynamics into a rescaled (hidden) system; It ultimately identifies the scaling exponents as the eigenvalues of a Perron-Frobenius operator acting on invariant measures of the rescaled equations. Considering a minimal shell model of scalar advection of the Kraichnan type that was previously studied by Biferale &amp; Wirth, the present work extends the hidden symmetry approach to a stochastic setting, in order to explicitly contrast it with the zero-mode scenario. Our study indicates that the zero-mode and the multiplicative scenarios are intrinsically related. For systems of the Kraichnan type, the first approach provides a quantitative chararacterization of intermittency, while the second approach highlights the universal connection between the scalar case and a larger class of hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>A quantum Pascal pyramid and an extended de Moivre-Laplace theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pascal's triangle is widely used as a pedagogical tool to explain the "first-order" multiplet patterns that arise in the spectra of $I_N S$ coupled spin-1/2 systems in magnetic resonance. Various other combinatorial structures, which may be well-known in the broader field of quantum dynamics, appear to have largely escaped the attention of the magnetic resonance community with a few exceptions, despite potential usefulness.
  In this brief set of lecture notes, we describe a "quantum Pascal pyramid" (OEIS https://oeis.org/A268533) as a generalization of Pascal's triangle, which is shown to directly map the relationship between multispin operators of arbitrary spin product rank $q$ ($\hat{Z}_N^q$) and population operators for states with magnetic quantum number $m$ ($\hat{S}_N^m$), and - as a consequence - obtain the general form of the intensity ratios of multiplets associated with antiphase single-quantum coherences, with an expression given in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.
  An extension of the de Moivre-Laplace theorem, beyond the trivial case $q=0$, is applied to the $q$-th columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid, and is given in terms of a product of the $q$-th order Hermite polynomials and a Gaussian distribution, reproducing the well-known functional forms of the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the classical limit of Hermite-Gaussian modes in laser physics (Allen et al., $\textit{Phys. Rev. A.}$, $\textbf{45}$, 1992). This is used to approximate the Fourier-transformed spectra of $\hat{Z}_N^q$-associated multiplets of arbitrary complexity.
  Finally, an exercise is shown in which the first two columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid are used to calculate the previously known symmetry-constrained upper bound on $I_z \rightarrow S_z$ polarization transfer in $I_N S$ spin systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>

      <title>Negative eigenvalue estimates for the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger operator with measure-potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the negative part of the spectrum of the operator $-\partial^2 - \mu$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$, where a locally finite Radon measure $\mu \geq 0$ is serving as a potential. We obtain estimates for the eigenvalue counting function, for individual eigenvalues and estimates of the Lieb-Thirring type. A crucial tool for our estimates is Otelbaev's function, a certain average of the measure potential $\mu$, which is used both in the proofs and the formulation of most of the results.</description>

      <title>Criterion of singularity formation for radial solutions of the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations in exceptional dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>
