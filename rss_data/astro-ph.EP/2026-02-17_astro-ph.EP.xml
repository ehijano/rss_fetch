      <title>The Interplanetary Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a system-wide measure of the sustainment of life (habitability) for space-faring interplanetary species is introduced and explored. Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system.</description>

      <title>Dust Morphology Under Changing Dust Mass Ratios in Protoplanetary Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disc mass is one of the most fundamental properties of a planet-forming system, as it sets the total mass budget available for planet formation. However, obtaining disc mass measurements remain challenging, since it is not possible to directly detect H$_2$, and CO abundance ratios are poorly constrained. Dynamical measurements of the disc mass are now possible, but they are not suited to all discs since the measurements typically require well-behaved emission surfaces. A long-standing method is to obtain continuum flux measurements from the dust emission, and convert to a total disc mass by assumption of the dust-to-gas mass ratio, $\epsilon$. This quantity is poorly constrained in protoplanetary discs. %
We investigate the impact of $\epsilon$ on the morphology of planet-containing hydrodynamical simulations of dusty protoplanetary accretion discs, and suggest that if a planet mass estimate can be obtained, then disc morphology could be used to constrain $\epsilon$ in observed systems relative to each other, improving the total disc mass estimates of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Diversities and similarities exhibited by multi-planetary systems and their architectures: II. Radii of singles and multis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovered planets in apparent single-planet systems (singles) and those in systems with multiple detected planets (multis) exhibit a rich diversity of physical and orbital properties. We investigate the differences and similarities between 1730 singles and 1522 multis in a catalogue of confirmed transiting planets orbiting main-sequence stars with spectral classes ranging from late-M to late-F. After we removed the hot Jupiters, the planet types and their fractional numbers were similar for the multis and singles hosted by FGK-type stars. Furthermore, the median radii of both the singles and the multis increase with host star temperature already from late- to early-type M dwarfs and further up to F stars. Our analyses show that the singles are larger on average than the multis in our F, G, K, and M samples. However, after we excluded the hot Jupiters, the radius distributions of the singles and multis orbiting FGK stars are statistically indistinguishable, particularly at $R &lt; 4\, R_\oplus$. In the FGK sample, we also identified an unexpected and significant overabundance of multis, compared to singles, at radii of $\approx1.4-1.6\, R_\oplus$. For the early- and late-type M samples, our work indicates that the multis are smaller on average than the singles and that the radius distributions of the multis and singles are different, except for the planets with $R &lt; 4\, R_\oplus$ hosted by early-type M dwarfs. Nevertheless, these results for the two M samples are inconclusive because the sample sizes of 167 and 101 planets are limited. In conclusion, our analyses reveal that the singles and multis, excluding the hot Jupiters, orbiting FGK stars are overall consistent with originating from the same underlying population based on their planet types and radii. This interpretation is, however, not applicable within the region of the overabundance of multis identified in this work.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion Volatile Evolution of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Indicating Significant Contribution from Extended Source in the Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar comets provide rare opportunities for probing the diversity of refractory and volatile inventory around other stars. As the second ever interstellar comet, and the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS has been the focus of telescopic observations since its discovery in July 2025. Following the previous observations at multi-wavelengths, we present further radio observations of the 1665/1667 MHz ground-state OH lines and millimeter observations of the CO($J$=1-0) transition at 115.271 GHz that trace the coma $\rm H_2O$ and CO abundances, respectively. We derived OH production rates of $(1.32\pm0.47)\times10^{28}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 2.27 au and $(1.89\pm0.37)\times10^{28}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 1.96 au as well as an average CO production rate of $\rm (5.75\pm1.91) \times 10^{27}\, s^{-1}$ between 2.33 and 1.75 au, inferring a CO/$\rm H_2O$ ratio of ($28\pm11\%$). With the mean HCN production rate of $2.5\times 10^{25}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 2.1 au reported by \citet{2025arXiv251120845R} and \citet{2025arXiv251002817C}, we infer a CO/HCN ratio of ($230\pm76$). By synthesizing water production rates measured with instruments of different apertures, we found that the sublimation from extended source in the coma contributes significantly to 3I's pre-perihelion water measurements, accounting for up to 80\% from 3 au to 2 au.</description>

      <title>Formation and Survival of Complex Organic Molecules in the Jovian Circumplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are key targets in the search for habitability due to the potential presence of subsurface oceans. Detecting complex organic molecules (COMs), essential for prebiotic chemistry, is crucial to assessing their potential. Though COMs remain undetected on these moons, ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions aim to fill this gap with their science payloads. This study explores the formation and transport of COMs within Jupiter's circumplanetary disk (CPD), a critical environment for the formation of the Galilean moons. Using a time-dependent model that couples the evolving CPD structure with the dynamics of icy particles of varying sizes and release times, we assess two primary COM formation pathways: thermal processing of ices and UV photochemistry. The results indicate that heating, particularly of NH3:CO2 ices, occurs efficiently before substantial irradiation, making it the dominant pathway for COM formation in the Jovian CPD. However, the relative efficiencies of these two processes are governed by particle density, disk viscosity, accretion rate, and UV flux, which collectively determine drift timescales and exposure to favorable thermodynamic environments. Existing models indicate that Europa's accretion was relatively cold and prolonged, possibly allowing some COMs to survive incorporation, whereas Ganymede and Callisto likely formed under even cooler conditions conducive to preserving COM-rich material. These results highlight the potential inheritance of complex organics by the Galilean moons and offer a framework for interpreting upcoming compositional data from JUICE and Europa Clipper.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric constraints on GJ 1214 b from CRIRES+ and prospects for characterisation with ANDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to constrain the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214 b using all available transits observed with the upgraded CRIRES+ spectrograph at the VLT by searching for the signatures of water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide. We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R ~ 100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities (~ 100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Statistical Validation and Vetting of Exoplanet Candidate TOI 7475.01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive validation analysis of the exoplanet candidate TOI 7475.01 (TIC 376866659), detected by the TESS mission. Using a custom pipeline combining natural flux preservation with robust BLS detection, we identified a transit signal with a period of $3.2538$ days and a depth of $\sim 4600$ ppm. To rule out false positives, we performed centroid analysis, spatial contamination checks using Gaia DR3, and a statistical validation using triceratops. Our results show a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 294.13 and a False Positive Probability (FPP) of $\approx 0$. Based on the clean spatial environment, stable centroids, and high statistical probability, we validate TOI 7475.01 as a planetary companion.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Model of Jupiter's Great Red Spot Upper Chromophore Haze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the red colouration in Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is a long-standing question in planetary science. While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\times10^{-12}$-$7\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\mathrm{trop}}\lesssim 1.5\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $\mu$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.</description>

      <title>Geodetically Anchored 0.30m Digital Elevation Model of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram Landing Site from Chandrayaan-2 Orbital High Resolution Camera (OHRC) Stereo Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ISRO's terrain characterization and hazard mapping from Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) stereo imagery were central to the safe landing of Chandrayaan-3 - the first successful landing in the lunar south polar region. However, these elevation products were generated with a proprietary pipeline and have not been publicly released. We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products.
  The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites.
  At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis.</description>

      <title>Description of 4 Spacecraft, Moving on Elliptic Kepler Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Break in the Specific Angular Momentum within the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_{\phi}$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.</description>

      <title>Habitable Zones Around Massive Stars: From the Main Sequence to Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\,M_\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\,M_\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\sim 30$~Myr at $\sim 70$-$130$~AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\,M_\odot$ and disappears by $15\,M_\odot$. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to $\sim 25$-$30\,M_\odot$, but only for $\sim 0.03$-$1.5$~Myr at hundreds to $\sim 10^3$~AU, disappearing by $\sim 40\,M_\odot$. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Susceptibility of Dust Grains with Superparamagnetic Inclusions and Implications</title>

Abstract: Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $\omega$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\rm act}) \ln (\nu_{0}/\omega)$ with $T_{\rm act}$ activation temperature and $\nu_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $\chi_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}(\omega)$ at $N_{\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $\nu_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited.
  Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation.
  Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization is used for the fitting.
  Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II.
  Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.</description>

      <title>Periodicities in radio emissions from the Jupiter's magnetosphere and consequences for radio emissions from star-exoplanet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a topic of major scientific interest, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and, therefore, to probe the inner structure of exoplanets. However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...</description>

      <title>Comparative biosignatures with systemic retrievals</title>

Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST can reveal biosignature gases, though current discoveries have yet to evidence life. The central challenge is attribution: how can we confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially given the stochastic abiotic processes that can set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we propose a comparative multi-planet approach centred on systemic retrievals: the analysis of multiple planets within a system to empirically define the `abiotic baseline'. This baseline, constructed from obligate uninhabited planets, serves as a local reference point. Systemic retrievals enable marginalisation over inaccessible, latent, shared abiotic parameters within planet evolution models. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, have been irradiated by the same evolving star, and have a linked dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally-informed abiotic planet evolution models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Potentially biological anomalies are identified as statistical outliers from the abiotic baseline using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation. A comparative biosignature is thus defined: an anomaly where a biotic planetary evolution model provides a superior fit than its abiotic counterpart. Where both abiotic and biotic models yield poor predictive accuracy, the anomaly is flagged as an ``unknown unknown"; a signature of either unconstrained abiotic processes, or life as we don't yet know it.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation in a non-inertial frame attached to one of the bodies. The energy of relative motion is not conserved in this frame due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</description>

      <title>A Linearized Approach to Radial-Velocity Extraction. II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Data Mining-Based Cislunar Escape-Family Analysis in The Multi-Body Models</title>

Abstract: Escape trajectories from the Earth-Moon system play an important role in interplanetary transfer. This paper focuses on the escape trajectories from a 167 km circular Earth orbit in the Earth-Moon planar circular three-body problem and the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular four-body problem and is denoted to providing a comprehensive analysis on these escape trajectories. To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction. This paper establishes an analysis methodology of escape trajectories from a perspective of escape families, deepening the understanding of escape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Densities of small planets around the M dwarfs TOI-4336 A and TOI-4342 with ESPRESSO: Three sub-Neptunes, one super-Earth, and a Neptune-mass candidate</title>

Abstract: We present the characterization of two planetary systems orbiting the M dwarfs TOI-4336 A (M3.5V) and TOI-4342 (M0V), each hosting two transiting planets previously validated with TESS and ground-based observations. We refined the photometry of the TOI-4342 system using TESS and LCOGT data, and characterized the host stars with NIRPS and ESPRESSO spectroscopy. High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \pm 0.13$ Me. The TOI-4342 system hosts two sub-Neptunes of similar sizes ($2.33 \pm 0.09$ Re and $2.35 \pm 0.09$ Re), with periods of 5.54 and 10.69 days. Their masses are measured to be $7.3 \pm 1.3$ Me and $4.8 \pm 1.4$ Me, respectively. The RVs also reveal a planet candidate around TOI-4342, likely non-transiting, with a period of 47.5 days and a minimum mass of $17.8 \pm 3.0$ Me. With precise radii and masses, we derived bulk densities and explored possible compositions. The TOI-4336 A sub-Neptune and super-Earth have densities of $1.87 \pm 0.30$ and $4.35 \pm 0.79$ g cm$^{-3}$, while the two similar-sized sub-Neptunes in TOI-4342 show distinct densities of $3.18 \pm 0.67$ and $2.01 \pm 0.63$ g cm$^{-3}$. All four planets are excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization with JWST, and their multi-planet nature makes them especially interesting for comparative planetology. Notably, TOI-4336 A b stands out as one of the best-known targets in its size and temperature regime, with a TSM of 138, comparable to benchmark planets such as K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b.</description>

      <title>Imaging Venus-like Worlds: Spectral, Polarimetric, and UV Diagnostics for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

Abstract: Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Velocities of Free Floaters in a Sea of Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (``free floaters'') through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</description>

      <title>Modeling YSO Jets in 3D II: Accretion-Fed, Star-Anchored Poynting Jets in the Low-Density Polar Cavity Powered by Disk-Magnetosphere Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of jets in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains a subject of active investigation. We present a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the accretion disk. In our model, a fast, low-density bipolar jet is powered by disk-magnetosphere interaction and launched through the polar cavity that is mass-loaded from the disk rather than the star. Specifically, outflows are driven by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along "two-legged" field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the (magnetically elevated) disk surface via a cyclic "load-fire-reload" process: in the "load" stage, differential rotation between stellar and disk footpoints generates toroidal magnetic pressure; in the "fire" stage, vertical gradients in the toroidal field accelerate plasma and transport Poynting flux into the polar cavity; in the "reload" stage, magnetic reconnection allows the cycle to repeat, reforming "two-legged" field lines. These field lines are not required to be fully reset to a dipolar loop configuration; it is only required that the disk-end be shallowly embedded in the (elevated) disk surface. This rapid, asynchronous process produces a continuous, large-scale outflow. The resulting magnetically dominated (Poynting) jet, accelerated by magnetic pressure within the low-density polar cavity, is distinct from the denser, slower disk wind launched through the classic magnetic-tower mechanism. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.</description>

      <title>Two late-T dwarfs at kiloparsec distances revealed by JWST UNCOVER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.</description>
