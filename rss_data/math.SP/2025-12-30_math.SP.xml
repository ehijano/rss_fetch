      <title>Multi-resolution deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical deconvolution framework in Rn to the case with a pseudodifferential-like solution operator with a symbol depending on both the base and cotangent variable. Our framework enables deconvolution with spatially varying resolution while maintaining a set global stability, and it additionally allows rather general distributional convolution kernels. We provide consistency, convergence and stability results, as well as convergence rates. Finally, we include numerical examples supporting our results and demonstrating advantages of the generalized framework.</description>

      <title>Scaling inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues in space forms and sharp eigenvalue estimates on warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part, we derive monotonicity of the normalized spectra for the second-order Steklov problem and two fourth-order Steklov problems on the $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with respect to the geodesic radius in the sphere and the hyperbolic space. The normalizations are made using four natural geometric factors. As corollaries, we get Escobar-type bounds for Steklov eigenvalues on $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with varying curvature in space forms. We also get two monotonicity results for higher-dimensional cases. In the second part, we obtain some sharp bounds concerning the spectra of the two fourth-order Steklov problems on warped product manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and a strictly convex boundary. In particular, we confirm Qiaoling Wang and Changyu Xia's conjecture (2018) on the sharp lower bound of the first non-zero eigenvalue of a fourth-order Steklov problem in the case of $3$-dimensional warped product manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Finite Element Approach for High-precision Guaranteed Lower Eigenvalue Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds remains difficult, even though the standard high-order conforming finite element (FEM) easily yields extremely sharp upper bounds. Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes. These results confirm that the proposed approach provides a practical and competitive solution to the long-standing difficulty of obtaining sharp, reliable lower eigenvalue bounds.</description>

      <title>On a magneto-spectral invariant on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a magneto-spectral invariant for finite graphs. This invariant vanishes on trees and is maximized by complete graphs. We compute this invariant for cycles, complete graphs, wheel graphs, hypercubes, complete bipartite graphs and suspensions of trees and derive various lower and upper bounds. In particular, we provide a sharp upper bound for regular bipartite graphs and derive a direct relation between the class of graphs assuming this upper bound and the class of unit weighing matrices, which are generalizations of complex Hadamard matrices. Moreover, this class of bipartite graphs has non-negative magnetic Bakry-\'Emery curvature and is preserved under both the Cartesian product and a partial tensor product for bipartite graphs. The study of our invariant for certain pairs of cospectral graphs indicates also that this invariant allows us to distinguish between them. Finally, we discuss the behaviour of this invariant under various graph operations and investigate relations to the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between inverse scattering for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and the Calder\'on problem for the Conformal Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we use the relation obtained by Guillarmou--Guillop\'e and Chang--Gonz\'alez between the generalized eigenvalue problem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds and the Conformal Laplacian, to obtain a new inverse scattering result: on an AH manifold of dimension $n+1$ with constant scalar curvature $-n(n+1)$, we show that the scattering matrix at energy $\frac{n+1}{2}$ determines the jet of the metric on the boundary, up to a diffeomorphism and conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Pr\"ufer Transformation and Spectral Analysis for a Sturm--Liouville-Type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a second-order differential equation involving a quasi-derivative, leading to a non-self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville-type problem with four coefficient functions. To analyze this equation, we develop a generalized Pr\"ufer transformation that expresses solutions in terms of amplitude and phase variables. We further prove the monotonicity of eigenfunction zeros with respect to the spectral parameter and derive upper and lower bounds for the eigenvalues.</description>
