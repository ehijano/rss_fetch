      <title>A Multi-physics Model of Flow from Coronary Angiography: Insights into Microvascular Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) can lead to insufficient blood flow to the myocardium, affecting millions of people globally. Coronary angiography, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities, offers valuable information that assists in diagnosing these diseases. However, these benefits are not fully understood or utilized in current clinical practice. In this study, a 3D-0D coupled multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and calibrated to simulate and better understand the process of contrast injection and washout during clinical angiography. A contrast intensity profile (CIP) was introduced to capture the dynamics of coronary angiography data. Additionally, a sensitivity study was conducted to assess the influence of various coronary artery model parameters on CIP. The results demonstrate that the calibrated 3D-0D coupled multi-physics models are physiologically meaningful and produce accurate hemodynamic results. The sensitivity study further reveals that resistance has a greater impact on CIP than capacitance, with higher resistance amplifying this effect.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Effectively Process and Execute Financial Trading Instructions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created transformative opportunities for the financial industry, especially in the area of financial trading. However, how to integrate LLMs with trading systems has become a challenge. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent trade order recognition pipeline that enables the conversion of trade orders into a standard format in trade execution. The system improves the ability of human traders to interact with trading platforms while addressing the problem of misinformation acquisition in trade execution. In addition, we have created a trade order dataset of 500 pieces of data to simulate real-world trading scenarios. Moreover, we designed several metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset reliability and the generative power of big models in finance by experimenting with five state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset. The results indicate that while LLMs demonstrate high generation rates (87.50% to 98.33%) and perfect follow-up rates, they face significant challenges in accuracy (5% to 10%) and completeness, with high missing rates (14.29% to 67.29%). In addition, LLMs tend to over-interrogate, suggesting that large models tend to collect more information, carrying certain challenges for information security.</description>

      <title>Solving 1D Poisson problem with a Variational Quantum Linear Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have recently been developed as a near-term way to solve linear systems of equations on quantum devices. However, the focus has so far been mostly on the methods, rather than the problems that they need to tackle. In fact, these algorithms have been run on real hardware only for problems in quantum physics, such as Hamiltonians of a few qubits systems. These problems are particularly favorable for quantum hardware, since their matrices are the sum of just a few unitary terms and since only shallow quantum circuits are required to estimate the cost function. However, for many interesting problems in linear algebra, it appears far less trivial to find an efficient decomposition and to trade it off with the depth of the cost quantum circuits. A first simple yet interesting instance to consider are tridiagonal systems of equations. These arise, for instance, in the discretization of one-dimensional finite element analyses.
  This work presents a method to solve a class of tridiagonal systems of equations with the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), a recently proposed variational hybrid algorithm for solving linear systems. In particular, we present a new decomposition for this class of matrices based on both Pauli strings and multi--qubit gates, resulting in less terms than those obtained by just using Pauli gates. Based on this decomposition, we discuss the tradeoff between the number of terms and the near-term implementability of the quantum circuits. Furthermore, we present the first simulated and real-hardware results obtained by solving tridiagonal linear systems with VQLS, using the decomposition proposed.</description>

      <title>Mechanical State Estimation with a Polynomial-Chaos-Based Statistical Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Statistical Finite Element Method (statFEM) offers a Bayesian framework for integrating computational models with observational data, thus providing improved predictions for structural health monitoring and digital twinning. This paper presents an efficient sampling-free statFEM tailored for non-conjugate, non-Gaussian prior probability densities. We assume that constitutive parameters, modeled as weakly stationary random fields, are the primary source of uncertainty and approximate them using Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansion. The resulting stochastic solution field, i.e., the displacement field, is a non-stationary, non-Gaussian random field, which we approximate via Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion. The PC coefficients are determined through projection using Smolyak sparse grids. Additionally, we model the measurement noise as a stationary Gaussian random field and the model misspecification as a mean-free, non-stationary Gaussian random field, which is also approximated using KL expansion. The coefficients of the KL expansion are treated as hyperparameters. The PC coefficients of the stochastic posterior displacement field are computed using the Gauss-Markov-K\'alm\'an filter, while the hyperparameters are determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the efficiency and convergence of the proposed method through one- and two-dimensional elastostatic problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents GRFsaw, an open-source software for generating two-phase (binary) microstructures with user-defined structural properties. Unlike most standard software for microstructure generation, GRFsaw is based on the concept of thresholding Gaussian random fields (GRF). It is designed to be used by researchers or engineers in need of a lightweight tool to generate microstructures of various geometries, for example as input to simulations or to other models where such geometries are needed. This could be simulations of fluid flow through porous media, in predictive models of electromagnetic scattering by materials, or in mechanical loading simulations in order to assess, e.g., the material's elasticity or strength.</description>

      <title>FedDW: Distilling Weights through Consistency Optimization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative distributed machine learning paradigm that enables neural network training across devices without centralizing data. While this addresses issues of information sharing and data privacy, challenges arise from data heterogeneity across clients and increasing network scale, leading to impacts on model performance and training efficiency. Previous research shows that in IID environments, the parameter structure of the model is expected to adhere to certain specific consistency principles. Thus, identifying and regularizing these consistencies can mitigate issues from heterogeneous data. We found that both soft labels derived from knowledge distillation and the classifier head parameter matrix, when multiplied by their own transpose, capture the intrinsic relationships between data classes. These shared relationships suggest inherent consistency. Therefore, the work in this paper identifies the consistency between the two and leverages it to regulate training, underpinning our proposed FedDW framework. Experimental results show FedDW outperforms 10 state-of-the-art FL methods, improving accuracy by an average of 3% in highly heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof that FedDW offers higher efficiency, with the additional computational load from backpropagation being negligible. The code is available at https://github.com/liuvvvvv1/FedDW.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Protein Representations to Predict Protein Melting Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein melting temperature changes (Delta Tm) is fundamental for assessing protein stability and guiding protein engineering. Leveraging multi-modal protein representations has shown great promise in capturing the complex relationships among protein sequences, structures, and functions. In this study, we develop models based on powerful protein language models, including ESM-2, ESM-3, SaProt, and AlphaFold, using various feature extraction methods to enhance prediction accuracy. By utilizing the ESM-3 model, we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the s571 test dataset, obtaining a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.50. Furthermore, we conduct a fair evaluation to compare the performance of different protein language models in the Delta Tm prediction task. Our results demonstrate that integrating multi-modal protein representations could advance the prediction of protein melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven, Parameterized Reduced-order Models for Predicting Distortion in Metal 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), the applied laser energy produces high thermal gradients that lead to unacceptable final part distortion. Accurate distortion prediction is essential for optimizing the 3D printing process and manufacturing a part that meets geometric accuracy requirements. This study introduces data-driven parameterized reduced-order models (ROMs) to predict distortion in LPBF across various machine process settings. We propose a ROM framework that combines Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and compare its performance against a deep-learning based parameterized graph convolutional autoencoder (GCA). The POD-GPR model demonstrates high accuracy, predicting distortions within $\pm0.001mm$, and delivers a computational speed-up of approximately 1800x.</description>

      <title>Parametric-ControlNet: Multimodal Control in Foundation Models for Precise Engineering Design Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generative model designed for multimodal control over text-to-image foundation generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion, specifically tailored for engineering design synthesis. Our model proposes parametric, image, and text control modalities to enhance design precision and diversity. Firstly, it handles both partial and complete parametric inputs using a diffusion model that acts as a design autocomplete co-pilot, coupled with a parametric encoder to process the information. Secondly, the model utilizes assembly graphs to systematically assemble input component images, which are then processed through a component encoder to capture essential visual data. Thirdly, textual descriptions are integrated via CLIP encoding, ensuring a comprehensive interpretation of design intent. These diverse inputs are synthesized through a multimodal fusion technique, creating a joint embedding that acts as the input to a module inspired by ControlNet. This integration allows the model to apply robust multimodal control to foundation models, facilitating the generation of complex and precise engineering designs. This approach broadens the capabilities of AI-driven design tools and demonstrates significant advancements in precise control based on diverse data modalities for enhanced design generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, an ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of a Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of an (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics model. The energy-based, compositional approach simplifies understanding complex models, and it makes it easy to encapsulate, reuse, and replace (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Separable Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool in machine learning for modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Although Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) show promise, they require extensive data acquisition. Physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONet) mitigate data scarcity but suffer from inefficient training processes. We introduce Separable Operator Networks (SepONet), a novel framework that significantly enhances the efficiency of physics-informed operator learning. SepONet uses independent trunk networks to learn basis functions separately for different coordinate axes, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training via forward-mode automatic differentiation. We provide a universal approximation theorem for SepONet proving the existence of a separable approximation to any nonlinear continuous operator. Then, we comprehensively benchmark its representational capacity and computational performance against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate SepONet's superior performance across various nonlinear and inseparable PDEs, with SepONet's advantages increasing with problem complexity, dimension, and scale. For 1D time-dependent PDEs, SepONet achieves up to 112x faster training and 82x reduction in GPU memory usage compared to PI-DeepONet, while maintaining comparable accuracy. For the 2D time-dependent nonlinear diffusion equation, SepONet efficiently handles the complexity, achieving a 6.44% mean relative $\ell_{2}$ test error, while PI-DeepONet fails due to memory constraints. This work paves the way for extreme-scale learning of continuous mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.

      <title>A robust quantum nonlinear solver based on the asymptotic numerical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising new avenue for advancing computational methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce the quantum asymptotic numerical method, a novel quantum nonlinear solver that combines Taylor series expansions with quantum linear solvers to efficiently address nonlinear problems. By linearizing nonlinear problems using the Taylor series, the method transforms them into sequences of linear equations solvable by quantum algorithms, thus extending the convergence region for solutions and simultaneously leveraging quantum computational advantages. Numerical tests on the quantum simulator Qiskit confirm the convergence and accuracy of the method in solving nonlinear problems. Additionally, we apply the proposed method to a beam buckling problem, demonstrating its robustness in handling strongly nonlinear problems and its potential advantages in quantum resource requirements. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a superconducting quantum processor from Quafu, successfully achieving up to 98% accuracy in the obtained nonlinear solution path. We believe this work contributes to the utility of quantum computing in scientific computing applications.</description>
