      <title>Layered Division and Global Allocation for Community Detection in Multilayer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in multilayer networks (CDMN) is to divide a set of entities with multiple relation types into a few disjoint subsets, which has many applications in the Web, transportation, and sociology systems. Recent neural network-based solutions to the CDMN task adopt a kind of representation fusion and global division paradigm: Each node is first learned a kind of layer-wise representations which are then fused for global community division. However, even with contrastive or attentive fusion mechanisms, the fused global representations often lack the discriminative power to capture structural nuances unique to each layer. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the CDMN task: Layered Division and Global Allocation (LDGA). The core idea is to first perform layer-wise group division, based on which global community allocation is next performed. Concretely, LDGA employs a multi-head Transformer as the backbone representation encoder, where each head is for encoding node structural characteristics in each network layer. We integrate the Transformer with a community-latent encoder to capture community prototypes in each layer. A shared scorer performs layered division by generating layer-wise soft assignments, while global allocation assigns each node the community label with highest confidence across all layers to form the final consensus partition. We design a loss function that couples differentiable multilayer modularity with a cluster balance regularizer to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks demonstrate that our LDGA outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of higher detected community modularities. Our code with parameter settings and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDGA-552B/.</description>

      <title>UniCom: Towards a Unified and Cohesiveness-aware Framework for Community Search and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching and detecting communities in real-world graphs underpins a wide range of applications. Despite the success achieved, current learning-based solutions regard community search, i.e., locating the best community for a given query, and community detection, i.e., partitioning the whole graph, as separate problems, necessitating task- and dataset-specific retraining. Such a strategy limits the applicability and generalization ability of the existing models. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on information from the target dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when supervision is limited or unavailable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose UniCom, a unified framework to solve both community search and detection tasks through knowledge transfer across multiple domains, thus alleviating the limitations of single-dataset learning. UniCom centers on a Domain-aware Specialization (DAS) procedure that adapts on the fly to unseen graphs or tasks, eliminating costly retraining while maintaining framework compactness with a lightweight prompt-based paradigm. This is empowered by a Universal Graph Learning (UGL) backbone, which distills transferable semantic and topological knowledge from multiple source domains via comprehensive pre-training. Both DAS and UGL are informed by local neighborhood signals and cohesive subgraph structures, providing consistent guidance throughout the framework. Extensive experiments on both tasks across 16 benchmark datasets and 22 baselines have been conducted to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation. UniCom consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks under settings with scarce or no supervision, while maintaining runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Identifying preferred routes of sharing information on social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of information has become faster and wider than ever with the advent of social network platforms. The question raised in this study is whether information dissemination in social networks is random or follows a discernible structure. Our results from real-world hashtag data suggest that the spread of hashtags is not random and follows specific patterns. This study proposes two preferential models to explore how news spreads on social media. Specifically, we examine global and local preferential selection models and demonstrate that information dissemination aligns with these patterns. According to these two models, information flows are distributed through specific paths on networks. This suggests that new information tends to propagate along the same paths as previous news, with the specific pathways varying depending on the type of content. Finally, an examination of the propagation of political hashtags on Twitter confirms the existence of these paths that also emerge from the two preferential models.</description>

      <title>Embedding networks with the random walk first return time distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first return time distribution (FRTD) of a random walk as an interpretable and mathematically grounded node embedding. The FRTD assigns a probability mass function to each node, allowing us to define a distance between any pair of nodes using standard metrics for discrete distributions. We present several arguments to motivate the FRTD embedding. First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features. Together these results demonstrate the FRTD as a simple and mathematically principled embedding for complex networks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic construction of typical networks in network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often desirable to assess how well a given dataset is described by a given model. In network science, for instance, one often wants to say that a given real-world network appears to come from a particular network model. In statistical physics, the corresponding problem is about how typical a given state, representing real-world data, is in a particular statistical ensemble. One way to address this problem is to measure the distance between the data and the most typical state in the ensemble. Here, we identify the conditions that allow us to define this most typical state. These conditions hold in a wide class of grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures. Our main contribution is a deterministic construction of a state that converges to this most typical state in the thermodynamic limit. This construction involves rounds of derandomization procedures, some of which deal with derandomizing point processes, an uncharted territory. We illustrate the construction on one particular network model, deterministic hyperbolic graphs, and its application to real-world networks, many of which we find are close to the most typical network in the model. While our main focus is on network models, our results are very general and apply to any grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures satisfying certain niceness requirements.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Large Scale Production Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an algorithm to reconstruct large weighted firm-to-firm networks using information about the size of the firms and sectoral input-output flows. Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity. We provide open-source code of the algorithm to enable researchers to reconstruct large-scale granular production networks from publicly available data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, freelancing platforms have experienced significant growth in both worker registrations and job postings. However, the rise of generative AI (GenAI) technologies has raised questions about how it affect the job posting in freelancer market. Despite growing discussions, there is limited empirical research on the GenAI adoption and its effect on job demand and worker engagement. We present a large-scale analysis of Freelancer.com, utilizing over 1.8 million job posts and 3.8 million users. We investigate the emergence of jobs with the adoption of GenAI and identify leading position of ChatGPT in the freelancing market. With a focus on ChatGPT related jobs, we inspect their specific skill requirements, and the tasks that workers are asked to perform. Our findings provide insights into the evolving landscape of freelancing in the age of AI, offering a comprehensive profile of GenAI's effects on employment, skills, and user behaviors in freelancing market.</description>

      <title>Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</description>

      <title>A review of mechanistic and data-driven models of terrorism and radicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.08485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of radical ideologies in recent years has led to a worldwide string of terrorist attacks. Understanding how extremist tendencies germinate, develop, and drive individuals to action is important from a cultural standpoint, but also to help formulate response and prevention strategies. Demographic studies, interviews with radicalized subjects, analysis of terrorist databases, reveal that the path to radicalization occurs along progressive steps, where age, social context and peer-to-peer exchange of extremist ideas play major roles. Furthermore, the advent of social media has offered new channels of communication, facilitated recruitment, and hastened the leap from mild discontent to unbridled fanaticism. While a complete sociological understanding of the processes and circumstances that lead to full-fledged extremism is still lacking, quantitative approaches, using modeling and data analyses, can offer useful insight. We review some approaches from statistical mechanics, applied mathematics, data science, that can help describe and understand radicalization and terrorist activity. Specifically, we focus on compartment models of populations harboring extremist views, continuous time models for age-structured radical populations, radicalization as social contagion processes on lattices and social networks, adversarial evolutionary games coupling terrorists and counter-terrorism agents, and point processes to study the spatiotemporal clustering of terrorist events. We also present recent applications of machine learning methods on open-source terrorism databases. Finally, we discuss the role of institutional intervention and the stages at which de-radicalization strategies might be most effective.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs See Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.</description>
