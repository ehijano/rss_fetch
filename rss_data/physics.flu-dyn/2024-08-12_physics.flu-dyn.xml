      <title>Slip Length in Shear Flow Over a Textured Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrophobic textured surfaces are studied for their low wettability and their capacity to create a 'slippery' fluid on the surface during lubrication. To this end, the flow between two parallel surfaces is numerically addressed by computing two-dimensional numerical simulations. One of the surfaces moves with a uniform rectilinear motion, while the other is fixed, with a cavity in the middle. The steady-state flow is laminar and monophasic with a low Reynolds number. The reduction of the wall shear stress caused by a vortex in the cavity, with respect to a Couette flow, looks like the creation of an equivalent slip of the fluid on the wall at a macroscopic scale.Three methods are used to calculate the slip length: one is based on the wall shear stress and the other two are based on the speed of the fluid flow. When the slip length is calculated according to these three methods, the obtained results differ. The differences show that the slip often used in the literature is a macroscopic representation of local effects that are not necessarily slippery. The speed profiles and the streamlines are then discussed, in order to propose an explanation for this difference.</description>

      <title>Pore-resolved CFD in Digital Twin of Porous Monoliths Reconstructed by Micro-computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous media are ubiquitous in the fields of energy storage and conversion, catalysis, biomechanics, hydrogeology, and other chemical engineering processes. These media possess high surface-to-volume ratios and their complex channels can restrict and direct the flow. This makes them key components of multiple equipment despite the challenges in selecting design parameters for specific applications. Pore-resolved CFD reveals the effects of their structure at the microscopic scale, but is currently limited by high computing costs and the performance of mesh generation algorithms. This work introduces a RBF-based representation of solids in a massively parallel immersed-boundary framework, enabling both the usage of non-conformal grids and dynamic mesh adaptation. We verify it using the method of manufactured solutions. We validate it using pressure drop measurements through porous silicone monoliths digitized by X-ray computed microtomography for Reynolds numbers up to 30, using grids of 200 M cells distributed over 8 k cores. The reliable model is then used to highlight that pore network structure is the main factor describing pressure evolution and that preferential channels are present at this scale of the porous media. This work opens the door to design and optimize processes by linking microscopic flow to macroscopic properties through the usage of physics-based digital twins of complex porous media.</description>

      <title>The effect of Reynolds number on the separated flow over a low-aspect-ratio wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high incidence, low-aspect-ratio wings present a unique set of aerodynamic characteristics, including flow separation, vortex shedding, and unsteady force production. Furthermore, low-aspect ratio wings exhibit a highly impactful tip vortex, which introduces strong spanwise gradients into an already complex flow. In this work, we explore the interaction between leading edge flow separation and a strong, persistent tip vortex over a Reynolds number range of $600 \leq Re \leq 10,000$. In performing this study, we aim to bridge the insight gained from existing low Reynolds number studies of separated flow on finite wings ($Re \approx 10^2$) and turbulent flows at higher Reynolds numbers ($Re \approx 10^4$). Our study suggests two primary effects of Reynolds number. First, we observe a break from periodicity, along with a dramatic increase in the intensity and concentration of small-scale eddies, as we shift from $Re = 600$ to $Re = 2,500$. Second, we observe that many of our flow diagnostics, including the time-averaged aerodynamic force, exhibit reduced sensitivity to Reynolds number beyond $Re = 2,500$, an observation attributed to the stabilizing impact of the wing tip vortex. This latter point illustrates the manner by which the tip vortex drives flow over low-aspect-ratio wings, and provides insight into how our existing understanding of this flowfield may be adjusted for higher Reynolds number applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Realization of Popping Impinging Sprays of Hypergolic Bipropellants by a Eulerian-Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work adopts a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to numerically simulate the spray impingement of MMH (Monomethyl hydrazine)/NTO (nitrogen tetroxide), which are prevalent rocket engine bipropellants for deep space missions and satellite orbital maneuvers. The emphasis of the work is to computationally realize the popping phenomenon and to study its parametric dependence on liquid and gas-phase reaction rates. The liquid-phase reaction of MMH/NTO is realized based on the extended spray equation, incorporating the additional independent variable, propellant mass fraction, to account for the mixing of droplets. The spray popping can be computationally reproduced over wide ranges of Damk\"ohler numbers for both liquid- and gas-phase reactions. Furthermore, the computational results have been validated through qualitative comparison with experimental images and quantitative comparison with experimental frequencies. The present results verify our hypothesis that the heat release from the liquid-phase reaction enhances the evaporation of MMH and NTO so that the intense gas-phase reaction zone around the spray impingement point periodically separates the MMH and NTO impinging sprays to cause the popping phenomenon. Furthermore, it was found that the popping phenomenon can be suppressed by reducing the Damk\"ohler numbers of liquid-phase reaction and therefore to suppress the evaporation of the propellants. This work is believed to provide valuable understanding for avoiding the off-design popping phenomenon that may reduce combustion efficiency and increase the risk of combustion instability in rocket engines.</description>

      <title>Weak-inertial effects on destabilized receding contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that beyond a critical speed, the straight contact line of a partially-wetting liquid destabilizes into a corner. In one of the earliest theoretical works exploring this phenomenon, [L. Limat and H. A. Stone, Europhys. Lett. 65(3), 2004] elicited a self-similar conical structure of the interface in the viscous regime. However, noting that inertia is not expected to be negligible at contact line speeds close to, and beyond the critical value for many common liquids, we provide the leading-order inertial correction to their solution. In particular, we find the self-similar corrections to the interface shape as well as the flow-field, and also determine their scaling with the capillary number. We find that inertia invariably modifies the interface into a cusp-like shape with an increased film thickness. Furthermore, when incorporating contact line dynamics into the model, resulting in a narrowing of the corner as the contact line speed increases, we still observe an overall increase in the inertial contribution with speed despite the increased confinement.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation and analysis of mixing enhancement due to chaotic advection using an adaptive approach for approximating the dilution index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A velocity field characterized by chaotic advection induces stretching and folding processes that increase the solute-solvent interface available for diffusion. Identifying chaotic flow fields with optimized mixing enhancement is relevant for applications like groundwater remediation, microfluidics, and many more. This work uses the dilution index to quantify the temporal increase in mixing of a solute within its solvent. We introduce a new approach to select a suitable grid size for each time step in the dilution index approximation, motivated by the theory of representative elementary volumes. It preserves the central feature of the dilution index, which is monotonically increasing in time and hence leads to reliable results. Our analysis highlights the importance of a suitable choice for the grid size in the dilution index approximation. We use this approach to demonstrate the mixing enhancement for two chaotic injection-extraction systems that exhibit chaotic structures: a source-sink dipole and a rotated potential mixing. By analyzing the chaotic flow fields, we identify Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser (KAM) islands, non-mixing regions that limit the chaotic area in the domain and, thereby, the mixing enhancement. Using our new approach, we assess the choice of design parameters of the injection-extraction systems to effectively engineer chaotic mixing. We demonstrate the important role of diffusion in filling the KAM islands and reaching complete mixing in the systems.</description>

      <title>Mode-to-mode nonlinear energy transfer in turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear energy transfer for channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of $Re_{\tau}=180$ and $590$. The key feature of the analysis is that we introduce a new variable, which quantifies the energy transferred from a source mode to a recipient mode through explicit examination of nonlinear triadic interactions in streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space. First, we use this variable to quantify the nonlinear energy transfer gain and loss for individual Fourier modes. The nonlinear energy transfer gain and loss cannot be directly obtained from the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation. Second, we quantify the nonlinear energy transfer budgets for three types of structures: streamwise streaks, oblique waves and Tollmien-Schlichting waves. We found that a transverse cascade from streamwise-elongated modes to spanwise-elongated modes exists in all three structures. Third, we quantify the forward and inverse cascades between resolved scales and subgrid scales in the spirit of large-eddy simulation. For the cutoff wavelength range we consider, the forward and inverse cascades between the resolved scales and subgrid scales result in a net forward cascade from the resolved scales to the subgrid scales. The shape of the net forward cascade curve with respect to the cutoff wavelength resembles the net forward cascade predicted by the Smagorinsky eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Dynamically relevant recurrent flows obtained via a nonlinear recurrence function from two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the efficient extraction of unstable recurrent flows from two-dimensional turbulence by using nonlinear triads to diagnose recurrence in direct numerical simulations. Nearly recurrent episodes are identified from simulations and then converged using a standard Newton- GMRES-hookstep method, however with much greater diversity than previous studies which performed this 'recurrent flow analysis'. Unstable periodic and relative periodic orbits are able to be identified which span larger values of dissipation rate, i.e. corresponding to extreme bursting events. The triad variables are found to provide a more natural way to weight the greater variety of spatial modes active in such orbits than a standard Euclidian norm of complex Fourier amplitudes. Moreover the triad variables build in a reduction of the continuous symmetry of the system which avoids the need to search over translations when obtaining relative periodic orbits. Armed with these orbits we investigate optimal weightings when reconstructing the statistics of turbulence and suggest that, in fact, a simple heuristic weighting based on the solution instability provides a very good prediction, provided enough dynamically relevant orbits are included in the expansion.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids, examining how their elastic modulus $G$ and their relaxation time $\lambda$ affect jet and droplet formation. We show that the viscoelastic liquids yield Newtonian-like behavior as either parameter $G$ or $\lambda$ approaches zero, while increasing them suppresses jet formation due to elastic resistance to elongational flows. Intriguingly, for some cases with intermediate values of $G$ and $\lambda$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by the elastocapillary number (dimensionless $G$) and the Deborah number (dimensionless $\lambda$), we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Velocity Coupling in Transpiration Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transpiration cooling is an active thermal protection system of increasing interest in aerospace applications wherein a coolant is effused through a porous wall into a hot external flow. The present work focuses on the interaction between the high-temperature turbulent boundary layer and the pressure-driven coolant flow through the porous wall. Coupling functions were obtained from pore-network simulations to characterize the flow through the porous medium. These were then coupled to direct numerical simulations of a turbulent boundary layer over a massively-cooled flat plate. Two different types of coupling function were used: linear expressions, which do not account for flow interactions between neighbouring pores, and shallow convolutional neural networks (CNN) which incorporate spatial correlations. All coupled cases demonstrated a significant variation in blowing due to the streamwise variation in mean pressure associated with the onset of coolant injection. This trend was reflected in the cooling effectiveness, and was mitigated in the CNN-coupled cases due to the incorporation of lateral flow between neighbouring pores. The distribution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the coupled cases was also modified by the coupling due to the competing effects of near-wall turbulence attenuation and increased shear due to increasing blowing ratio. Finally, the coupling was shown to impact the power spectral density of the pressure fluctuations at the wall within the transpiration region, attenuating the largest scales of the turbulence whilst leaving the smaller scales relatively unaffected.</description>

      <title>RG approach to the inviscid limit for shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an initial value problem for shell models that mimic turbulent velocity fluctuations over a geometric sequence of scales. Our goal is to study the convergence of solutions in the inviscid (more generally, vanishing regularization) limit and explain the universality of both the limiting solutions and the convergence process. We develop a renormalization group (RG) formalism representing this limit as dynamics in a space of flow maps. For the dyadic shell model, the RG dynamics has a fixed-point attractor, which determines universal limiting solutions. Deviations from the limiting solutions are also universal and given by a leading eigenmode (eigenvalue and eigenvector) of the linearized RG operator. Application to the Gledzer and Sabra shell models reveal the respective quasiperiodic and chaotic RG dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards aerodynamic surrogate modeling based on $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models combining dimensionality reduction and regression techniques are essential to reduce the need for costly high-fidelity CFD data. New approaches using $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) architectures have shown promise in obtaining high-quality low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data while enabling physical interpretation of their latent spaces. We propose a surrogate model based on latent space regression to predict pressure distributions on a transonic wing given the flight conditions: Mach number and angle of attack. The $\beta$-VAE model, enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional latent space, showing a direct correlation with flight conditions. Regularization through $\beta$ requires careful tuning to improve the overall performance, while PCA pre-processing aids in constructing an effective latent space, improving autoencoder training and performance. Gaussian Process Regression is used to predict latent space variables from flight conditions, showing robust behavior independent of $\beta$, and the decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional pressure field data. This pipeline provides insight into unexplored flight conditions. Additionally, a fine-tuning process of the decoder further refines the model, reducing dependency on $\beta$ and enhancing accuracy. The structured latent space, robust regression performance, and significant improvements from fine-tuning collectively create a highly accurate and efficient surrogate model. Our methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of $\beta$-VAEs for aerodynamic surrogate modeling, offering a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for aerodynamic data prediction.</description>

      <title>Receding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have explored receding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces, composed of micropillars arrays. We present here dynamic receding contact angle measurements of water on such surfaces, covering contact line speeds spanning over five decades. We have studied the effect of pillars fraction on dynamical receding contact angles. We compared these measurements to those on smooth surfaces with the same chemical nature and also with similar systems reported in the literature.
  We show that superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit a significantly lower dependence of contact angle on contact line speed compared to smooth surfaces. Additionally, we observed that a higher surface fraction of pillars leads to a greater dependence of the contact angle on contact line speed, approaching the dependence of the angle on smooth surface. Interestingly, we show that the exact texuration of the surface does not play a fundamental role in the angle-velocity relationships as long as microtextures present the same type of periodic pattern (pillar arrays or microgrid). These results are interpreted in terms of viscous friction reduction on superhydrophobic surfaces, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms governing their unique dynamic behavior. In addition we show that contact angles follow same laws for two different geometries (milimetric sessile drop and a centimetric capillary bridge).</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained convolutional neural networks for inverse problems in spatiotemporal partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only &lt; 1\% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: The use of deep learning has become increasingly popular in reduced-order models (ROMs) to obtain low-dimensional representations of full-order models. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are often used to this end as they are adept at handling data that are spatially distributed, including solutions to partial differential equations. When applied to unsteady physics problems, ROMs also require a model for time-series prediction of the low-dimensional latent variables. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network useful for modeling sequential data, are frequently employed in data-driven ROMs for autoregressive time-series prediction. When making predictions at unseen design points over long time horizons, error propagation is a frequently encountered issue, where errors made early on can compound over time and lead to large inaccuracies. In this work, we propose using bagging, a commonly used ensemble learning technique, to develop a fully data-driven ROM framework referred to as the CAE-eLSTM ROM that uses CAEs for spatial reconstruction of the full-order model and LSTM ensembles for time-series prediction. When applied to two unsteady fluid dynamics problems, our results show that the presented framework effectively reduces error propagation and leads to more accurate time-series prediction of latent variables at unseen points.</description>

      <title>Flame Transfer Function Measurement of a Hydrogen-Blended Sequential Combustor</title>

Abstract: The flame transfer function (FTF) relates acoustic perturbations and the coherent heat release rate response. This frequency-dependent function governs the thermoacoustic stability of a combustor. The FTF measurement is therefore of great interest for predicting the stability of the a practical combustor connected to the engine's compressor and turbine. In this study, the flame transfer function of the sequential flame of an atmospheric constant pressure sequential combustor (CPSC) is experimentally measured. The thermal power of both the first- and second-stage flames is kept constant and their ratio is fixed at 1:1. The effects of hydrogen blending in the first and second stage fuel mixture on the sequential FTF are analyzed. The FTF of the sequential flame is fitted with a distributed time delay (DTD) model with two pulses. The trends of the model parameters obtained are consistent with the chemiluminescence OH* of the sequential flame.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>

Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum define a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>
