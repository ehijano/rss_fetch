      <title>Thinking Like a Student: AI-Supported Reflective Planning in a Theory-Intensive Computer Science Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of COVID-19, many universities implemented supplementary "reinforcement" roles to support students in demanding courses. Although the name for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of providing structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were often poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and integration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods and computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective planning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a second-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks, gaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery. These insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining targeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided walkthroughs. Conducted over a single semester, the intervention received positive student feedback, indicating increased confidence, reduced anxiety, and improved clarity, particularly in abstract topics such as the pumping lemma and formal language expressive power comparisons. The findings suggest that reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs can enhance pedagogical design in theoretically dense domains and may be adaptable to other cognitively demanding computer science courses.</description>

      <title>Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time. Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative linear logic fragments with sub-context-free complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new descriptive complexity characterisations of classes REG (regular languages), LCFL (linear context-free languages) and CFL (context-free languages) as restrictions on inference rules, size of formulae and permitted connectives in the Lambek calculus; fragments of the intuitionistic non-commutative linear logic with direction-sensitive implication connectives. Our identification of the Lambek calculus fragments with proof complexity REG and LCFL is the first result of its kind. We further show the CFL complexity of one of the strictly `weakest' possible variants of the logic, admitting only a single inference rule. The proof thereof, moreover, is based on a direct translation between type-logical and formal grammar and structural induction on provable sequents; a simpler and more intuitive method than those employed in prior works. We thereby establish a clear conceptual utility of the Cut-elimination theorem for comparing formal grammar and sequent calculus, and identify the exact analogue of the Greibach Normal Form in Lambek grammar. We believe the result presented herein constitutes a first step toward a more extensive and richer characterisation of the interaction between computation and logic, as well as a finer-grained complexity separation of various sequent calculi.</description>
