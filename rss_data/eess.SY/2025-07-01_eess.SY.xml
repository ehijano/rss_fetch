      <title>A Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework for Siting Fusion Energy Facilities: Application and Evaluation of U.S. Coal Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for siting fusion energy facilities, integrating expert judgment, geospatial data, and multi-criteria decision making tools to evaluate site suitability systematically. As a case study, we apply this framework to all currently operational coal power plant sites in the United States to examine their potential for hosting future fusion facilities at a time when these coal plants are shut down on reaching their end of life - timelines which are expected to coincide with the potential deployment of fusion energy facilities. Drawing on 22 siting criteria - including state and federal policies, risk and hazard assessments, and spatial and infrastructural parameters - we implement two MultiCriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods: the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM) to derive attribute weights and the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to rank sites based on composite suitability scores. By focusing on fusion-specific siting needs and demonstrating the framework through a coal site application, this study contributes a scalable and transparent decision-support tool for identifying optimal fusion energy deployment locations.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Excavation Force Estimation for Wheel Loaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate excavation force prediction is essential for enabling autonomous operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery. Conventional methods typically require extensive data collection or simulations across diverse soil types, limiting scalability and adaptability. This paper proposes a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force data from the prior bucket-loading cycle. Leveraging an analytical soil-tool interaction model, the fundamental earthmoving equation (FEE), our approach uses a multi-stage optimization strategy, on soil parameters during the loading phase. These fitted parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in the upcoming digging cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs without the need for extensive data collection or machine learning-based model training. The framework is validated in high-fidelity simulations using the Algoryx Dynamics engine, across multiple soil types and excavation trajectories, demonstrating accurate force predictions with root-mean-square errors of 10\% to 15\% in primary test cases. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation strategy showcases the potential for online and scalable efficient path planning for wheel loader operations.</description>

      <title>QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithm for Wireless Coexistence Parameter Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum is essential to support heterogeneous networks such as 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi, which often contend for shared wireless resources. We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-Based Design of RIS for Reduced Power Consumption and Simplified Control Circuitry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at simplifying the hardware structure and reducing the energy consumption in wireless communication via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), this paper introduces a novel RIS design founded on the correlation between the phase shift values of the surface elements. First, a correlation analysis is conducted, considering the azimuth angle of a target device within a coverage region spanning from $-80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. The correlation is demonstrated for different deployment cases, creating the basis for the new RIS structure, termed Connected-RIS, where correlated elements are designed to share the same control signal. The fundamental performance of the proposed design is then analyzed in terms of control signals, power consumption, and communication system performance, comparing it to two RIS structures with full control: one with the same size as the proposed design, and the other employing the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the fair coverage criterion. The correlation-based RIS design enables three-dimensional passive beamforming and significantly reduces the number of required load impedances and control signals, thereby lowering the hardware cost and simplifying the control circuitry. It also achieves substantial power savings as compared to the baseline schemes, while maintaining sufficient gain for a fair radio coverage. For instance, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed design reduces the power consumption by almost 86-92\% and the control signals by 83-98\% compared to operation with fully controlled RIS.</description>

      <title>X-pSRAM: A Photonic SRAM with Embedded XOR Logic for Ultra-Fast In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental bottlenecks due to continuous data movement between memory and processing units, a challenge that worsens with technology scaling as electrical interconnect delays become more significant. These limitations impede the performance and energy efficiency required for modern data-intensive applications. In contrast, photonic in-memory computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the advantages of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without length-dependent impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational latency and energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential photonic static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean XOR computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and differential photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell achieves at least 10 GHz read, write, and compute operations entirely in the optical domain. Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) enables n-bit XOR computation in a single-shot operation, supporting massively parallel processing and enhanced computational efficiency. Validated on GlobalFoundries' 45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ energy per bit for XOR computation, representing a significant advancement toward next-generation optical computing with applications in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Online Coreset Selection for Learning Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of streaming data in dynamic systems, a critical challenge in data-driven modeling for control is how to efficiently select informative data to characterize system dynamics. In this work, we design an online coreset selection method under the framework of set-membership identification for systems subject to process disturbances, with the objective of improving data efficiency while ensuring convergence guarantees. Specifically, we first propose a stacked polyhedral representation that over-approximates the feasible set of system parameters. Leveraging a generalized Gr\"unbaum's inequality, we design a geometric selection criterion for constructing the coreset. To reduce computational complexity, an online double-description-based constraint reduction method is introduced to simplify the polyhedral representation. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the feasible set with respect to the coreset and derive upper bounds on the selection probability and the expected number of data in the coreset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii) addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms, we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.</description>

      <title>Identification of Cellular Automata on Spaces of Bernoulli Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework for modeling global spatio-temporal dynamics with local interactions. While CCAs have been applied across numerous scientific fields, identifying the local rule that governs observed dynamics remains a challenging task. Moreover, the underlying assumption of deterministic cell states often limits the applicability of CCAs to systems characterized by inherent uncertainty. This study, therefore, focuses on the identification of Cellular Automata on spaces of probability measures (CAMs), where cell states are represented by probability distributions. This framework enables the modeling of systems with probabilistic uncertainty and spatially varying dynamics. Moreover, we formulate the local rule identification problem as a parameter estimation problem and propose a meta-heuristic search based on Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) to estimate local rule parameters accurately from the observed data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through local rule identification in two-dimensional CAMs with varying neighborhood types and radii.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Energy Management Strategies for Community Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a real-time energy management framework for hybrid community microgrids integrating photovoltaic, wind, battery energy storage systems, diesel generators, and grid interconnection. The proposed approach formulates the dispatch problem as a multi-objective optimization task that aims to minimize operational costs. Two control strategies are proposed and evaluated: a conventional rule-based control (RBC) method and an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach utilizing proximal policy optimization (PPO). A realistic case study based on Australian load and generation profiles is used to validate the framework. Simulation results demonstrate that DRL-PPO reduces operational costs by 18%, CO_2 emissions by 20%, and improves system reliability by 87.5% compared to RBC. Beside, DRL-PPO increases renewable energy utilization by 13%, effectively reducing dependence on diesel generation and grid imports. These findings demonstrate the potential of DRL-based approaches to enable cost-effective and resilient microgrid operations, particularly in regional and remote communities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.</description>

      <title>Extreme Scenario Characterization for High Renewable Energy Penetrated Power Systems over Long Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems with high renewable energy penetration are highly influenced by weather conditions, often facing significant challenges such as persistent power shortages and severe power fluctuations over long time scales. This paper addresses the critical need for effective characterization of extreme scenarios under these situations. First, novel risk indices are proposed to quantify the severity of continuous power shortages and substantial power fluctuations over long-term operations. These indices are independent of specific scheduling strategies and incorporate the system's resource regulation capabilities. By employing a filtering-based approach, the proposed indices focus on retaining key characteristics of continuous power shortages and fluctuation events, enabling the identification of extreme scenarios on long time scales. Secondly, an extreme scenario generation method is developed using Gaussian mixture models and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Especially, this method periodically evaluates the severity of generated scenarios based on the defined risk indices, retaining extreme scenarios while discarding less critical ones. Finally, case studies based on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results confirm that integrating the identified extreme scenarios significantly enhances the system's ability to ensure long-term security and reliability under high renewable energy penetration.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Implementations of Various Generalizations of Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two main frameworks for non-intrusive implementations of approximate balanced truncation: the quadrature-based framework and the ADI-based framework. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for access to the original model's state-space realization. Recently, the quadrature-based framework has been extended to various generalizations of balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension is theoretically nonintrusive-meaning it does not require the original state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the original transfer function for implementation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for HAPs-SAR Systems with Energy-Aware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a novel life-extending control scheme for critical helicopter components subjected to significant fatigue loading. The primary objective is to synthesize a more efficient and less conservative life-extending control scheme than those currently available in the literature. The proposed Load Limiting Control (LLC) scheme is a viable solution that addresses several issues that current life-extending control schemes suffer from, such as the neglect of fatigue damage induced by the harmonic component of loads and the inability to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive maneuvers. The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit boundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by computing a Control Margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module. The computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and avoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive controller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting harmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with sufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 seconds of initiating the tracking task.</description>

      <title>ANN-Based Grid Impedance Estimation for Adaptive Gain Scheduling in VSG Under Dynamic Grid Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay, making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.</description>

      <title>Predictor-Based Compensators for Networked Control Systems with Stochastic Delays and Sampling Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of time delays and sampling intervals in Networked Control Systems poses significant challenges for controller synthesis and analysis, often leading to conservative designs and degraded performance. This work presents a modeling approach for Linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networked Control Systems and introduces a compensation scheme based on the Filtered Smith Predictor to mitigate the adverse effects of stochastic time delays on closed-loop performance. The proposed scheme is evaluated through numerical simulations of a well-established Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control system. Results demonstrate that the compensator achieves near-ideal average closed-loop performance and significantly reduces response variability compared to a traditional Filtered Smith Predictor. Notably, it yields a 45% reduction in worst-case tracking error signal energy relative to an ideal baseline system with no time delays and constant sampling intervals.</description>

      <title>Power Flow Analysis of a 5-Bus Power System Based on Newton-Raphson Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load flow analysis is a fundamental technique used by electrical engineers to simulate and evaluate power system behavior under steady-state conditions. It enables efficient operation and control by determining how active and reactive power flows throughout the system. Selecting an appropriate solution method is critical to ensuring reliable and economical operation of power generation, transmission, and distribution networks. While the conventional loop method may be used in small-scale systems, it is limited by its reliance on impedance-based load data and its inability to scale to complex networks. In contrast, iterative techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Newton-Raphson (NR) methods are better suited for analyzing large systems. Of these, the NR method offers significant advantages due to its quadratic convergence and improved numerical stability. This study presents a power flow analysis of a 5-bus system using the Newton-Raphson approach. The system was modeled and simulated in PowerWorld Simulator (PWS), and a custom MATLAB implementation was developed to verify the results under a base case scenario. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the NR method provides accurate and robust solutions for power flow problems, making it well-suited for evaluating system performance under various operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Power-Gas Infrastructure Planning under Weather-induced Supply and Demand Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.</description>

      <title>A Bidirectional Power Router for Traceable Multi-energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address challenges in improving self-consumption of renewables and resilience in local residential power systems, the earlier work of the authors introduced a novel multi-energy management concept, integrating bidirectional power routing and electricity-hydrogen conversion. This paper focuses on an experimental verification of the bidirectional power router based on line-switching, the essential hardware to realize the concept. The primary contribution is the validation of the router's capability to handle dynamic change of bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, to achieve bidirectional power routing without affecting the smooth and stable operation of the power system, a novel algorithm for router's switching is designed based on power flow monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an experiment using a setup with a commercially available stationary battery.</description>

      <title>Reliability Assessment of Power System Based on the Dichotomy Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of states in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment of the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state assessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the state space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently partition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively small number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice partition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated lattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the calculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly tends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we designed a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to compute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the RBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the analytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which is about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed Monte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test systems.</description>

      <title>A Data-Ensemble-Based Approach for Sample-Efficient LQ Control of Linear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sample-efficient, data-driven control framework for finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control of linear time-varying (LTV) systems. In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem involves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters and terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex optimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT conditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual solution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case. This theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes the optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data sequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent framework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV systems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ control of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single input-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy, improving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon LTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach provides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying settings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in non-stationary environments. Simulation results show that, compared to recent methods, the proposed approach achieves superior optimality and sample efficiency on LTV systems, and indicates potential for stabilizing and optimal control of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twinning Approach to Decarbonisation: Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation accounts for around 27% of green house gas emissions in the UK. While an obvious priority area for decarbonisation, and aligned to the UK government goal of reducing emissions by 68% for 2030, the free-market nature of the transportation sector combined with its fundamentally implicit and pervasive connections to all aspects of society and national infrastructure mean that all decarbonisation efforts to date have been siloed within a single transport sector, e.g. only considering greener aviation fuels. Truly decarbonising transport requires radical changes to the entire transport infrastructure, and since that transport does not happen in isolation, a single user often using multiple modes, we need a view over the whole transport system. The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. As a result of the fragmented nature of the transportation sector, there is currently no system level view. Without the ability to monitor even adjacent transport domains, the ability for people or organisations to (dynamically) adapt their operations for decarbonisation outcomes is unrealistic. As transportation is a complex social-techno-economic system, information and knowledge sharing is a must to be able to understand and explore potential solutions to the decarbonisation challenge. We believe a Federated Digital Twinning Approach has the potential to tackle transport decarbonisation problems, and, in this extended abstract, we give an overview of the research required to tackle the fundamental challenges around digital twin design, generation, validation and verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample-based observability characterizes the ability to reconstruct the internal state of a dynamical system by using limited output information, i.e., when measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. In this work, we investigate the concept of functional observability, which refers to the ability to infer a function of the system state from the outputs, within a samplebased framework. Here, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be sample-based functionally observable, and formulate conditions on the sampling schemes such that these are satisfied. Furthermore, we provide a numerical example, where we demonstrate the applicability of the obtained results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating multiplicative fault signals in linear time-invariant systems by processing its input and output variables, as well as designing an input signal to maximize the accuracy of such estimates. The proposed real-time fault estimator is based on a residual generator used for fault detection and a multiple-output regressor generator, which feed a moving-horizon linear regression that estimates the parameter changes. Asymptotic performance guarantees are provided in the presence of noise. Motivated by the performance bounds, an optimal input design problem is formulated, for which we provide efficient algorithms and optimality bounds. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and the importance of the optimal input design for accurate fault estimation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Modeling for Accurate Characterization of Doppler Effect in LEO-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a promising solution for global wireless coverage, especially in underserved and remote areas. However, the high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts that disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system performance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated relative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users within the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe intercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical framework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth assumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's curvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle between the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical characterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential Doppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a spherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler shift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler experienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler variation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the coverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells, ensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances. Extensive simulations over realistic satellite constellations validate our analysis and reveal the impact of altitude, beamwidth, and satellite-user geometry on Doppler behavior.</description>

      <title>Orchestrated Couplings: A Time-Varying Edge Weight Framework for Efficient Event-Triggered Multiagent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on reducing node-to-node information exchange in distributed control of multiagent networks while improving the overall network performance. Specifically, we consider a multiagent network that is composed of leader and follower nodes over a time-varying, connected, and undirected graph. In contrast to existing works on the event-triggered distributed control literature, we propose a time-varying edge weight event-triggered control framework. In this framework, each node dynamically adjusts its edge weights by increasing them during the transient (active) phase and decreasing them during the steady-state (idle) phase of the multiagent network. This not only reduces the number of events in the network but also improves the performance (i.e., convergence speed and control effort) of the overall multiagent network. System-theoretically, we first prove the closed-loop stability of the proposed event-triggered distributed control framework, where we then show that this framework does not exhibit a Zeno behavior. Finally, illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this framework.</description>

      <title>Time Shift Governor-Guided MPC with Collision Cone CBFs for Safe Adaptive Cruise Control in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-guided Model Predictive Controller with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-based constraints for adaptive cruise control (ACC). This MPC-CBF approach is defined for obstacle-free curved road tracking, while following distance and obstacle avoidance constraints are handled using standard CBFs and relaxed Collision Cone CBFs. In order to address scenarios involving rapidly moving obstacles or rapidly changing leading vehicle's behavior, the TSG augmentation is employed which alters the target reference to enforce constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TSG-guided MPC-CBF approach.</description>

      <title>Reliable Transmission of LTP Using Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive FEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) employs the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) for reliable data delivery in challenging interplanetary networks. While previous studies have integrated packet-level Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) into LTP to reduce retransmission time costs, existing static and delay-feedback-based dynamic coding methods struggle with highly variable and unpredictable deep space channel conditions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive FEC algorithm to address these limitations. The algorithm utilizes historical feedback and system state to predict future channel conditions and proactively adjust the code rate. This approach aims to anticipate channel quality degradation, thereby preventing decoding failures and subsequent LTP retransmissions and improving coding efficiency by minimizing redundancy during favorable channel conditions. Performance evaluations conducted in simulated Earth-Moon and Earth-Mars link scenarios demonstrate this algorithm's effectiveness in optimizing data transmission for interplanetary networks. Compared to existing methods, this approach demonstrates significant improvement, with matrix decoding failures reduced by at least 2/3.</description>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly used in our everyday lives as well as in numerous industrial applications. However, due to limitations in computing and power capabilities, IoT devices need to send their respective tasks to cloud service stations that are usually located at far distances. Having to transmit data far distances introduces challenges for services that require low latency such as industrial control in factories and plants as well as artificial intelligence assisted autonomous driving. To solve this issue, mobile edge computing (MEC) is deployed at the networks edge to reduce transmission time. In this regard, this study proposes a new offloading scheme for MEC-assisted ultra dense cellular networks using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed scheme enables efficient resource allocation and dynamic offloading decisions based on varying network conditions and user demands. The RL algorithm learns from the networks historical data and adapts the offloading decisions to optimize the networks overall performance. Non-orthogonal multiple access is also adopted to improve resource utilization among the IoT devices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other stateof the art offloading algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, network throughput, and user satisfaction.</description>

Abstract: The stabilization of time series processes is a crucial problem that is ubiquitous in various industrial fields. The application of machine learning to its solution can have a decisive impact, improving both the quality of the resulting stabilization with less computational resources required. In this work, we present a simple pipeline consisting of two neural networks: the oracle predictor and the optimizer, proposing a substitution of the point-wise values optimization to the problem of the neural network training, which successfully improves stability in terms of the temperature control by about 3 times compared to ordinary solvers.</description>

      <title>On beam characterization of ground-based CMB radio telescopes using UAV-mounted sources: application to the QUIJOTE TFGI and plans for LSPE-Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), includes the development of LSPE-Strip, a ground-based radio telescope for observing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. LSPE-Strip, nearing its construction phase, will operate from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, employing 49 coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz to deliver critical data on CMB anisotropies and 6 channels at 95 GHz as atmospheric monitor. On-site characterization of such advanced instruments is crucial to detect possible systematic effects, such as gain fluctuations, beam distortions, and pointing errors, that can compromise performance by introducing spurious polarizations or radiation collection from unintended directions. To address these challenges, a drone-mounted Q-band test source for on-site characterization of LSPE-Strip's polarimeter array was developed. Modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible approach for antenna pattern measurements, yet their use in high-frequency radio astronomy is not consolidated practice. In October 2022, a UAV-based measurement campaign was conducted with the TFGI instrument on the second QUIJOTE telescope in Tenerife, in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. This pioneering effort aimed to validate UAV-based beam characterization methods and assess QUIJOTE's performance under operational conditions. Preliminary results demonstrated high measurement accuracy, leveraging QUIJOTE's dual-receiver configuration for beam validation. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing UAV systems in preparation for LSPE-Strip's future characterization.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Signal Photonic SRAM-based High-Speed Energy-Efficient Photonic Tensor Core with Novel Electro-Optic ADC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid surge in data generated by Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) applications demands ultra-fast, scalable, and energy-efficient hardware, as traditional von Neumann architectures face significant latency and power challenges due to data transfer bottlenecks between memory and processing units. Furthermore, conventional electrical memory technologies are increasingly constrained by rising bitline and wordline capacitance, as well as the resistance of compact and long interconnects, as technology scales. In contrast, photonics-based in-memory computing systems offer substantial speed and energy improvements over traditional transistor-based systems, owing to their ultra-fast operating frequencies, low crosstalk, and high data bandwidth. Hence, we present a novel differential photonic SRAM (pSRAM) bitcell-augmented scalable mixed-signal multi-bit photonic tensor core, enabling high-speed, energy-efficient matrix multiplication operations using fabrication-friendly integrated photonic components. Additionally, we propose a novel 1-hot encoding electro-optic analog-to-digital converter (eoADC) architecture to convert the multiplication outputs into digital bitstreams, supporting processing in the electrical domain. Our designed photonic tensor core, utilizing GlobalFoundries' monolithic 45SPCLO technology node, achieves computation speeds of 4.10 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and a power efficiency of 3.02 TOPS/W.</description>

      <title>FairMarket-RL: LLM-Guided Fairness Shaping for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Peer-to-Peer Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics: Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled {\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes, fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Measurements in the AI-Centric Computing Continuum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large, centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this critical area.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Model Predictive Control for Batch Manufacturing System Scheduling Under Different Electricity Pricing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing industries are among the highest energy-consuming sectors, facing increasing pressure to reduce energy costs. This paper presents an energy-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to dynamically schedule manufacturing processes in response to time-varying electricity prices without compromising production goals or violating production constraints. A network-based manufacturing system model is developed to capture complex material flows, batch processing, and capacities of buffers and machines. The scheduling problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that balances energy costs, buffer levels, and production requirements. A case study evaluates the proposed MPC framework under four industrial electricity pricing schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the approach reduces energy usage expenses while satisfying production goals and adhering to production constraints. The findings highlight the importance of considering the detailed electricity cost structure in manufacturing scheduling decisions and provide practical insights for manufacturers when selecting among different electricity pricing strategies.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Resilient-Native and Intelligent Next-Generation Wireless Systems: Key Enablers, Foundations, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Control in Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation, storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management. Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production, consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.</description>

      <title>Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile: A Perspective from Parameter Responses in Reinforcement Learning Under Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.</description>

      <title>External Data-Enhanced Meta-Representation for Adaptive Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility. However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors, such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information. We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/haorandd/M2oE2\_load\_forecast.git.</description>

      <title>Safe and Performant Deployment of Autonomous Systems via Model Predictive Control and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous systems to perform sophisticated tasks, it remains difficult for them to perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control (MPC) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to optimize task performance for autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.</description>

      <title>A Model Predictive Control Framework to Enhance Safety and Quality in Mobile Additive Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However, traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally, these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small, intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.</description>

      <title>Alleviating CoD in Renewable Energy Profile Clustering Using an Optical Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model. Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Shared Control in Teleoperation Without Haptic Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleoperation with non-haptic VR controllers deprives human operators of critical motion feedback. We address this by embedding a multi-objective optimization problem that converts user input into collision-free UR5e joint trajectories while actively suppressing liquid slosh in a glass. The controller maintains 13 ms average planning latency, confirming real-time performance and motivating the augmentation of this teleoperation approach to further objectives.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Planning and Control for Aerial 3D Inspection with Back-face Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately. Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics, directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.</description>

      <title>Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Suboptimality analysis of receding horizon quadratic control with unknown linear systems and its applications in learning-based control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07876v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process-Based Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework for unknown nonlinear systems. On the one hand, we approximate the system dynamics by the posterior means of the learned Gaussian processes (GPs). On the other hand, we exploit the posterior variances of the Gaussian processes to design the weighting matrices in the MHE cost function and account for the uncertainty in the learned system dynamics. The data collection and the tuning of the hyperparameters are done offline. We prove robust stability of the GP-based MHE scheme using a Lyapunov-based proof technique. Furthermore, as additional contribution, we derive a sufficient condition under which incremental input/output-to-state stability (a nonlinear detectability notion) is preserved when approximating the system dynamics using, e.g., machine learning techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the GP-based MHE scheme in two simulation case studies and show how the chosen weighting matrices can lead to an improved performance compared to standard cost functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a consensus problem in multidimensional networks having the same agent-to-agent interaction pattern under both intra- and cross-layer time delays. Several conditions for the agents to asymptotically reach a consensus are derived, which involve the overall network's structure, the local interacting pattern, and the assumptions specified on the time delays. The validity of these conditions is proved by direct eigenvalue evaluation and supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06639v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15867v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.</description>

      <title>A Global Coordinate-Free Approach to Invariant Contraction on Homogeneous Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a global condition for contraction with respect to an invariant Riemannian metric on reductive homogeneous spaces. Using left-invariant frames, vector fields on the manifold are horizontally lifted to the ambient Lie group, where the Levi-Civita connection is globally characterized as a real matrix multiplication. By linearizing in these left-invariant frames, we characterize contraction using matrix measures on real square matrices, avoiding the use of local charts. Applying this global condition, we provide a necessary condition for a prescribed subset of the manifold to possibly admit a contracting system, which accounts for the underlying geometry of the invariant metric. Applied to the sphere, this condition implies that no great circle can be contained in a contraction region. Finally, we apply our results to compute reachable sets for an attitude control problem.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the benefit of load uncertainty reduction for the design of district energy systems under grid constraints using the Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building energy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly.
  This study uses Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, and determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. An extension of the VoI framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data.
  Load uncertainty is found to significantly impact both system operating costs ($\pm$30%) and the optimal system design ($\pm$20%). However, using building monitoring data to improve the design of the district reduces overall costs by less than 1.5% on average. As this is less than the cost of measurement, using monitoring is not economically worthwhile in this case. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide most of the available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides little benefit for energy retrofit design.</description>

      <title>A behavioral approach for LPV data-driven representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven representation for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, which can be used for direct data-driven analysis and control of such systems. Specifically, we use the behavioral approach to develop a data-driven representation of the finite-horizon behavior of LPV systems for which there exists a kernel representation with shifted-affine scheduling dependence. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient rank-based test on the available data that concludes whether the data fully represents the finite-horizon LPV behavior. Using the proposed data-driven representation, we also solve the data-driven simulation problem for LPV systems. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate that the results in this paper allow us to formulate a novel set of direct data-driven analysis and control methods for LPV systems, which are also applicable for LPV embeddings of nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider undiscouted infinitehorizon optimal control for deterministic systems with an uncountable state and input space. We specifically address the case when the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we use the Ces`aro mean to define the infinite-horizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinite-horizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Ces\`aro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior. For this instance, we also show that the Ces\`aro value function recovers the undiscounted infinite-horizon optimal cost, if the latter is well-defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of controlling collective behavior in complex systems comprising large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents. Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual systems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of coordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus, synchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions generate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network topology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we emphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized interventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The chapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent ensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive event-triggered robust tracking control of soft robots</title>

Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sliding-Mode Control of Grid-Forming Inverters With Precision Region Under AC and DC Sides Varying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage regulation under conventional grid-forming controllers is tightly coupled to power sharing and dc-link dynamics. Consequently, its tracking accuracy deteriorates during grid faults, sudden power sharing changes, or dc-bus voltage varying. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its voltage precision region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when an abnormal entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, an asymmetry compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates voltage tracking error. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these variations separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage precision region is explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>MDR-DeePC: Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-enabled Predictive Control (MDR-DeePC) framework for systems with partially known and uncertain dynamics. The proposed method integrates model-based equality constraints for known dynamics with a Hankel matrix-based representation of unknown dynamics. A distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated to account for parametric uncertainty and stochastic disturbances. Simulation results on a triple-mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved disturbance rejection, reduced output oscillations, and lower control cost compared to standard DeePC. The results validate the robustness and effectiveness of MDR-DeePC, with potential for real-time implementation pending further benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gr\"obner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.</description>

      <title>KnowSafe: Combined Knowledge and Data Driven Hazard Mitigation in Artificial Pancreas Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in anomaly detection and run-time monitoring to improve the safety and security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Multi-Manifold Transformation Based Multivariate Time Series Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. The obtained results can also be applied to parameter estimations for a lumped QBTI system. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated generalized TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from time-domain input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these generalized TFMs. A numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient malicious information detection method based on set partitioning for large-scale Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of Internet of Things (IoT) into enterprise information management systems, organizations are pursuing digital transformation that hinges on real-time data insights-and yet face escalating security and governance risks. Detecting and responding to threats at scale without impairing system efficiency has therefore become a critical information-management and decision-support challenge for today's executives. This paper develops a distributed, gain-based anomaly-detection framework tailored to IoT-enabled enterprise systems, underpinned by an optimized sensor-subset partitioning strategy. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.</description>

      <title>Controlled Invariance in Fully Actuated Max-plus Linear Systems with Precedence Semimodules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a max-plus linear system and a semimodule, the problem of computing the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule is still open to this day. In this paper, we consider this problem for the specific class of fully actuated systems and constraints in the form of precedence semimodules. The assumption of full actuation corresponds to the existence of an input for each component of the system state. A precedence semimodule is the set of solutions of inequalities typically used to represent time-window constraints. We prove that, in this setting, it is possible to (i) compute the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule and (ii) decide the convergence of a fixed-point algorithm introduced by R.D. Katz in strongly polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a novel distributed learning algorithm using stochastic compressed communications. In detail, we pursue a modular approach, merging ADMM and a gradient-based approach, benefiting from the robustness of the former and the computational efficiency of the latter. Additionally, we integrate a stochastic integral action (error feedback) enabling almost sure rejection of the compression error. We analyze the resulting method in nonconvex scenarios and guarantee almost sure asymptotic convergence to the set of stationary points of the problem. This result is obtained using system-theoretic tools based on stochastic timescale separation. We corroborate our findings with numerical simulations in nonconvex classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popularity dynamics in social media depend on a complex interplay of social influence between users and popularity-based recommendations that are provided by the platforms. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time dynamical system to model the evolution of popularity on social media. Our model generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model to a set of influencers vying for popularity. We study the asymptotic behavior of this model and illustrate it with numerical examples. Our results highlight the interplay of social influence, past popularity, and content quality in determining the popularity of influencers.</description>
