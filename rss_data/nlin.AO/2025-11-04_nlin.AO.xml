      <title>ReLaX-Net: Reusing Layers for Parameter-Efficient Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNN) are promising platforms for next-generation computing systems. However, recent advances in digital neural network performance are largely driven by the rapid growth in the number of trainable parameters and, so far, demonstrated PNNs are lagging behind by several orders of magnitude in terms of scale. This mirrors size and performance constraints found in early digital neural networks. In that period, efficient reuse of parameters contributed to the development of parameter-efficient architectures such as convolutional neural networks.
  In this work, we numerically investigate hardware-friendly weight-tying for PNNs. Crucially, with many PNN systems, there is a time-scale separation between the fast dynamic active elements of the forward pass and the only slowly trainable elements implementing weights and biases. With this in mind,we propose the Reuse of Layers for eXpanding a Neural Network (ReLaX-Net) architecture, which employs a simple layer-by-layer time-multiplexing scheme to increase the effective network depth and efficiently use the number of parameters. We only require the addition of fast switches for existing PNNs. We validate ReLaX-Nets via numerical experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that ReLaX-Net improves computational performance with only minor modifications to a conventional PNN. We observe a favorable scaling, where ReLaX-Nets exceed the performance of equivalent traditional RNNs or DNNs with the same number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Lu and Hamilton model for solar flares over a rewiring complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modified Lu \&amp; Hamilton-type model where the neighborhood relations are replaced by topological connections, which can be dynamically altered. The model represents each grid node as a flux tube, as in the classic model, but with connections evolving to capture the complex effects of magnetic reconnection. Through this framework, we analyze how the dissipated energy distribution changes, particularly focusing on the power-law exponent $\alpha_E$, which decreases with respect to the original model due to rewiring effects. When the system is dominated by rewiring, it presents an exponential distribution exponent $\beta_E$, showing a faster decay of dissipated energy than in the original model. This leads to microflare-dominated dynamics at short timescales, causing the system to lose the scale-free behavior observed in both the original model (Lu \&amp; Hamilton 1991) and in configurations where energy release is primarily driven by forcing rather than rewiring.
  Our results reveal a clear transition from power-law to exponential regimes as the rewiring probability increases, fundamentally altering the energy distribution characteristics of the system. In contrast, when considering topological neighbors instead of local ones, the model's dynamics become intrinsically nonlocal. This leads to scaling exponents comparable to those reported in other nonlocal dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>How spatial patterns can lead to less resilient ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several theoretical models predict that spatial patterning increases ecosystem resilience. However, these predictions rely on simplifying assumptions, such as assuming isotropic and infinitely large ecosystems, and empirical evidence directly linking spatial patterning to enhanced resilience remains scarce. We introduce a unifying framework, encompassing existing models for vegetation pattern formation in water-stressed ecosystems, that relaxes these assumptions. This framework incorporates finite vegetated areas surrounded by desert and anisotropic environmental conditions that lead to non-reciprocal plant interactions. Under these more realistic conditions, we identify a novel desertification mechanism, known as nonlinear convective instability in physics but largely overlooked in ecology. These instabilities form when non-reciprocal interactions destabilize the vegetation-desert interface and can trigger desertification fronts even under stress levels where isotropic models predict stability. Importantly, ecosystems exhibiting periodic vegetation patterns are more susceptible to nonlinear convective instabilities than those with homogeneous vegetation, suggesting that spatial patterning may reduce, rather than enhance, resilience. These findings challenge the prevailing view that self-organized patterning enhances ecosystem resilience and provide a new framework for investigating how spatial dynamics shape the stability and resilience of ecological systems under changing environmental conditions.</description>
