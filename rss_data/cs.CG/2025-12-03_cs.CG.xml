      <title>Theoretical analysis of beaconless geocast protocols in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beaconless geocast protocols are routing protocols used to send messages in mobile ad-hoc wireless networks, in which the only information available to each node is its own location. Messages get routed in a distributed manner: each node uses local decision rules based on the message source and destination, and its own location. In this paper we analyze six different beaconless geocast protocols, focusing on two relevant 1D scenarios. The selection of protocols reflects the most relevant types of protocols proposed in the literature, including those evaluated in previous computer simulations. We present a formal and structured analysis of the maximum number of messages that a node can receive, for each protocol, in each of the two scenarios. This is a measure of the network load incurred by each protocol. Our analysis, that for some of the protocols requires an involved probabilistic analysis, confirms behaviors that had been observed only through simulations before.</description>

      <title>Devil's Games and $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$: Continuous Games complete for the First-Order Theory of the Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the complexity class Quantified Reals ($\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$). Let FOTR be the set of true sentences in the first-order theory of the reals. A language $L$ is in $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$, if there is a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to FOTR. This seems the first time this complexity class is studied. We show that $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$ can also be defined using real Turing machines. It is known that deciding FOTR requires at least exponential time unconditionally [Berman, 1980].
  We focus on devil's games with two defining properties: (1) Players (human and devil) alternate turns and (2) each turn has a continuum of options.
  First, we show that FOTRINV is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. FOTRINV has only inversion and addition constraints and all variables are in a compact interval. FOTRINV is a stepping stone for further reductions.
  Second, we show that the Packing Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. In the Packing Game we are given a container and two sets of pieces. One set of pieces for the human and one set for the devil. The human and the devil alternate by placing a piece into the container. Both rotations and translations are allowed. The first player that cannot place a piece loses.
  Third, we show that the Planar Extension Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given a partially drawn plane graph and the human and the devil alternate by placing vertices and the corresponding edges in a straight-line manner. The vertices and edges to be placed are prescribed before hand. The first player that cannot place a vertex loses.
  Finally, we show that the Order Type Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given an order-type together with a linear order. The human and the devil alternate in placing a point in the Euclidean plane following the linear order. The first player that cannot place a point correctly loses.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the free space of a translating box in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a convex polyhedral robot $B$ that can translate (without rotating) amidst a finite set of non-moving polyhedral obstacles in $\mathbb R^3$. The "free space" $\mathcal F$ of $B$ is the set of all positions in which $B$ is disjoint from the interior of every obstacle.
  Aronov and Sharir (1997) derived an upper bound of $O(n^2\log n)$ for the combinatorial complexity of $\mathcal F$, where $n$ is the total number of vertices of the obstacles, and the complexity of $B$ is assumed constant.
  Halperin and Yap (1993) showed that, if $B$ is either a box or a "flat" convex polygon, then a tighter bound of $O(n^2\alpha(n))$ holds. Here $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
  In this paper we prove that if $B$ is a box, then the complexity of $\mathcal F$ is $O(n^2)$. Furthermore, if $B$ is a convex polygon whose edges come in parallel pairs, then the complexity of $\mathcal F$ is $O(n^2)$ as well. These results settle the question of the asymptotical worst-case complexity of $\mathcal F$ for a box, as well as for all convex polygons.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for N-Dimensional Visualization and Simulation: Implementation and Evaluation including 4D Boolean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified framework for simulation and visualization of intuitive exploration of phenomena in N-dimensional space. While specialized libraries offer powerful geometric algorithms, they typically lack integrated environments for interactive trial and error, creating a barrier for researchers. The contribution of this research is the integration of Quickhull-based mesh generation, visualization via hyperplane slicing, and computationally expensive Boolean operations into a single, extensible platform, while maintaining interactivity. To validate its effectiveness, this paper presents a 4-dimensional implementation and introduces a new interaction design, termed `High-Dimensional FPS,' to enable intuitive high-dimensional exploration. Furthermore, as a case study to demonstrate the framework's high extensibility, I also integrated a non-rigid body physics simulation based on Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving real-time rendering (80 fps) of complex 4D objects and completing Boolean operations within seconds in a standard PC environment. By providing an accessible and interactive platform, this work lowers the entry barrier for high-dimensional simulation research and enhances its potential for applications in education and entertainment.</description>
