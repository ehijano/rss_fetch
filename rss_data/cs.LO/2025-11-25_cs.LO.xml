      <title>Uncertainty Removal in Verification of Nonlinear Systems against Signal Temporal Logic via Incremental Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework is presented for the verification of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications over continuous-time nonlinear systems under uncertainty. Based on reachability analysis, the proposed method addresses indeterminate satisfaction caused by over-approximated reachable sets or incomplete simulations. STL semantics is extended via Boolean interval arithmetic, enabling the decomposition of satisfaction signals into unitary components with traceable uncertainty markers. These are propagated through the satisfaction tree, supporting precise identification even in nested formulas. To improve efficiency, only the reachable sets contributing to uncertainty are refined, identified through the associated markers. The framework allows online or offline monitoring to adapt to incremental system evolution while avoiding unnecessary recomputation. A case study on a nonlinear oscillator demonstrates a significant reduction in satisfaction ambiguity, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Comparing Labeled Markov Chains: A Cantor-Kantorovich Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeled Markov Chains (or LMCs for short) are useful mathematical objects to model complex probabilistic languages. A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.</description>

      <title>A General (Uniform) Relational Semantics for Sentential Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general relational semantics framework which, by varying the axiomatization and components of the relational structures, provides a uniform semantics for sentential logics, classical and non-classical alike. The approach we take rests on a generalization of the J\'{o}nsson-Tarski representation (and duality) for Boolean algebras with operators to the cases of posets, semilattices, or bounded lattices (with, or without distribution) with quasi-operators. Completeness proofs rely on a choice-free construction of canonical extensions for the algebras in the quasivarieties of the equivalent algebraic semantics of the logics. Correspondence results for axiomatic extensions of the logics of implication that we study rely on a fully abstract translation into their modal companions and they are calculated using a generalized Sahlqvist - van Benthem algorithm.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Computational Paths and Fundamental Groups in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational paths treat propositional equality as explicit paths built from labelled deduction steps and rewrite rules. This view originates in work by de Queiroz and collaborators and yields a weak groupoid structure for equality, together with a computational account of homotopy inspired by homotopy type theory. In this paper we present a complete mechanization of this framework in Lean 4 and show how it supports concrete homotopy theoretic computations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formalize the theory of computational paths in Lean, including path formation, composition, inverses, and a rewrite system that identifies redundant or trivial paths. We prove that equality types with computational paths carry a weak groupoid structure in the sense of the original theory. Second, we organize this material into a reusable Lean library, ComputationalPathsLean, which exposes an interface for paths, rewrites, and loop spaces. This library allows later developments to treat computational paths as a drop-in replacement for propositional equality when reasoning about homotopical structure. Third, we apply the library to two canonical examples in algebraic topology. We give Lean proofs that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers and that the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the product of two copies of the integers, both via computational paths. These case studies demonstrate that the computational paths approach scales to nontrivial homotopical computations in a modern proof assistant. All the definitions and proofs described here are available in an open-source Lean 4 repository.</description>

      <title>Leibniz's Monadology as Foundation for the Artificial Age Score: A Formal Architecture for Al Memory Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Parameterised Complexity of Coverability in Vector Addition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parameterised complexity of the classic coverability problem for vector addition systems (VAS): given a finite set of vectors $V \subseteq\mathbb{Z}^d$, an initial configuration $s\in\mathbb{N}^d$, and a target configuration $t\in\mathbb{N}^d$, decide whether starting from $s$, one can iteratively add vectors from $V$ to ultimately arrive at a configuration that is larger than or equal to $t$ on every coordinate, while not observing any negative value on any coordinate along the way. We consider two natural parameters for the problem: the dimension $d$ and the size of $V$, defined as the total bitsize of its encoding. We present several results charting the complexity of those two parameterisations, among which the highlight is that coverability for VAS parameterised by the dimension and with all the numbers in the input encoded in unary is complete for the class XNL under PL-reductions. We also discuss open problems in the topic, most notably the question about fixed-parameter tractability for the parameterisation by the size of $V$.</description>

      <title>Operational semantics and program verification using many-sorted hybrid modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.05036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to allow: (a) specifying the operational semantics of a programming language; and (b) stating and proving properties about program correctness. Our framework is based on a many-sorted system of hybrid modal logic, for which we prove completeness results. We believe that our approach to program verification improves over the existing approaches within modal logic as (1) it is based on operational semantics which allows for a more natural description of the execution than Hoare's style weakest precondition used by dynamic logic; (2) being multi-sorted, it allows for a clearer encoding of semantics, with a smaller representational distance to its intended meaning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct an experiment using state-of-the-art LLMs to translate MiniF2F into Rocq. The translation task focuses on generating a Rocq theorem based on three sources: a natural language description, the Lean formalization, and the Isabelle formalization. We conducted our experiment in 3 stages of increasing complexity, from basic one-shot prompting to multi-turn conversations that incorporate feedback from unsuccessful attempts. At each stage, we perform multiple rounds of translation using increasingly advanced models: GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1 mini, and o1. We successfully translated 478 out of 488 theorems. The dataset is opensource: https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Approach to Specifying Preferences over Conflicting Facts and Querying Inconsistent Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs, we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified framework for representing commutative and Boolean rings through affine and hyperaffine algebraic theories. This yields categorical equivalences between these theories and rings, and leads to a new analysis of certain classes of modules over Boolean rings. The resulting structures naturally capture the algebraic semantics of the if-then-else construct in programming languages.</description>

      <title>REAL-Prover: Retrieval Augmented Lean Prover for Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).</description>

      <title>BemaGANv2: A Tutorial and Comparative Survey of GAN-based Vocoders for Long-Term Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GANbased vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Long-term audio generation is critical for applications in Text-to-Music (TTM) and Text-to-Audio (TTA) systems, where maintaining temporal coherence, prosodic consistency, and harmonic structure over extended durations remains a significant challenge. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD) + MED, MSD + MRD, and Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD)) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.</description>

Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bridging LLM Planning Agents and Formal Methods: A Case Study in Plan Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Expressive Temporal Specifications for Reward Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</description>
