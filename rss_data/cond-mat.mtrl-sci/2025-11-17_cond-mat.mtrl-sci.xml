      <title>High Mobility Multiple-Channel AlScN/GaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) is a promising barrier material for gallium nitride (GaN)-based transistors for the next generation of radio-frequency electronic devices. In this work, we examine the transport properties of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in single- and multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and demonstrate the lowest sheet resistance among AlScN-based systems reported to date. Assorted schemes of GaN/AlN interlayers are first introduced in single-channel structures between AlScN and GaN to improve conductivity, increasing electron mobility up to $1370$ cm$^{2}$/V$\cdot$s at 300 K and $4160$ cm$^{2}$/V$\cdot$s at 77 K, reducing the sheet resistance down to 170 $\Omega/\square$ and 70 $\Omega/\square$ respectively. These improvements are then leveraged in multi-channel heterostructures, reaching sheet resistances of 65 $\Omega/\square$ for three channels and 45 $\Omega/\square$ for five channels at 300 K, further reduced to 21 $\Omega/\square$ and 13 $\Omega/\square$ at 2 K, respectively, confirming the presence of multiple 2DEGs. Structural characterization indicates pseudomorphic growth with smooth surfaces, while partial barrier relaxation and surface roughening are observed at high scandium content, with no impact on mobility. This first demonstration of ultra-low sheet resistance multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures places AlScN on par with state-of-the-art multi-channel Al(In)N/GaN systems, showcasing its capacity to advance existing and enable new high-speed, high-power electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Transition from Screw to Edge Dislocation Glide Enhances High-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of body-centered cubic materials is traditionally known to be governed by screw dislocations. However, recent findings reveal that in certain refractory complex concentrated alloys, edge dislocations can instead control strength. This work integrates high-temperature mechanical testing, in-situ neutron scattering during heating and tension, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the mechanism behind this behavior. In the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system, increasing the V content, due to its smaller atomic size, induces substantial atomic misfit that raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lead-Free Europium Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites possess desirable optical, material, and electrical properties which have had substantial impact on next-generation optoelectronics. However, given the toxicity of lead, alternative lead-free perovskite semiconductors are needed. By fully replacing lead with rare-earth elements, one can simultaneously address toxicity concerns and achieve comparable optoelectronic performance. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of two-dimensional europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets governed by the formula $\mathrm{L_{2}EuX_{4}}$ where L is an organic ligand and X is a halide anion. The structure, morphology, and composition of the nanoplatelets are confirmed by XRD, AFM, and XPS. Deep blue-emitting $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuBr_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 446 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.1515, 0.0327) and (0.1515, 0.0342), respectively. Additionally, near-ultraviolet $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuCl_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 400 nm and 401 nm, respectively. Overall, europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets offer a lead-free alternative for deep blue, violet, and near-ultraviolet light emission $\unicode{x2013}$ charting new pathways for optoelectronics in this energy regime.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen Atom Clusters and Vacancy Defects on Graphene: A Molecular Dynamics Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene's exceptional mechanical properties are crucial for its integration into advanced technological applications. However, real-world synthesis and functionalization processes introduce structural modifications that can compromise its mechanical integrity. Nitrogen doping, while beneficial for electronic property tuning, often results in atomic clustering rather than uniform distribution, while concurrent vacancy defect formation represents another common structural alteration during processing. This study systematically investigates the comparative effects of nitrogen atom clusters and equivalent sized vacancy defects on the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. The Nitrogen clustering significantly degraded mechanical performance almost similarly to random doping. In comparison, systems with equivalent-sized vacancy defects showed higher stiffness and lower ductility than those with clusters. The study revealed distinct failure mechanisms between doped and defective configurations, with nitrogen clusters showing modified crack propagation patterns while vacancies acted as pronounced stress concentrators, leading to premature failure. However, this study also showed that defect morphology critically influences mechanical properties. These findings provide important insights for optimizing graphene synthesis and processing protocols, highlighting the differential mechanical risks associated with dopant clustering versus vacancy formation. The results inform defect-tolerant design strategies for graphene-based nanoelectronics, composites, and sensors, where mechanical reliability is paramount for device performance and longevity.</description>

      <title>Ripple-assisted adsorption of noble gases on graphene at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable gas adsorption is critical for both scientific and industrial fields, and high-capacity adsorption of gases on solid surfaces provides a significant promise due to its high-safety and low-energy consumption. However, the adsorption of nonpolar gases, particularly noble gases, poses a considerable challenge under atmospheric pressure and room temperature (RT). Here, we theoretically simulate and experimentally realize the stable adsorption of noble gases like xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), argon (Ar), and helium (He) on highly rippled graphene at RT. The elemental characteristics of adsorbed Xe are confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorbed gas atoms are crystalized with periodic arrangements. These adsorbed noble gases on graphene exhibit high stability at RT and can be completely desorbed at approximately 350 {\deg}C without damaging the intrinsic lattice of graphene. The structural and physical properties of graphene are significantly influenced by the adsorbed gas, and they fully recover after desorption. Additionally, this controllable adsorption could be generalized to other layered adsorbents such as NbSe2, MoS2 and carbon nanotubes. We anticipate that this ripple-assisted adsorption will not only re-define the theoretical framework of gas adsorption, but also accelerate advancements in gas storage and separation technologies, as well as enhance the applications in catalysis, surface modification, and other related fields.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic structure of relaxor ferroelectrics from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hybridize swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. But ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. The majority of Nb ions collapse into a dominant Nb cluster which percolates the lattice with a mesh-like geometry that prevents large space charges. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function agreeing with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric property of PMN.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable partial antiferromagnetism, glassy spin dynamics, and magnetodielectric coupling in the quasi-one-dimensional spin-chain compound Ca3CoIrO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the quasi-one-dimensional spin-chain compound Ca3CoIrO6 (CCIO) using a combination of structural, magnetic, thermodynamic, transport, Raman, and dielectric measurements. Temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction confirms the rhombohedral R-3c structure down to 5 K without any structural phase transition. DC magnetization, ac susceptibility, and relaxation measurements reveal a gradual evolution from a high-temperature paramagnetic-like state to a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) state below 100 K, accompanied by slow cluster-like spin dynamics followed by a freezing transition near 30 K. Isothermal magnetic hysteresis M(H) loops demonstrate partial chain freezing, while robust exchange bias is observed in field-cooled protocols, highlighting the interplay between PDA ordering and frozen spins. Resistivity and specific heat data indicate strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, accompanied by activated transport behavior. Raman spectroscopy identifies pronounced anomalies in phonon frequencies and linewidths across multiple magnetic regimes, reflecting strong spin-lattice coupling. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements reveal temperature-dependent crossovers from linear dielectric to weakly hysteretic behavior, consistent with short-range polar correlations driven by spin-lattice interactions. These findings establish CCIO as a prototypical quasi-one-dimensional frustrated spin-chain system where geometric frustration, spin-orbit coupling, and low-dimensionality generate field-tunable PDA order, glassy spin dynamics, exchange bias, and magnetodielectric coupling. These results provide new insights into frustration-driven phases in low-dimensional oxides and point towards potential multifunctional applications based on intrinsic magnetodielectric and exchange bias phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tunable electronic band structure in WSSe van der Waals Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of semiconducting 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is known to be tunable by its environment, from simple external fields applied with electrical contacts up to complex van der Waals heterostructure assemblies. However, conventional alloying from reference binary TMD compounds to composition-controlled ternary alloys also offers unexplored opportunities. In this work, we use nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the structural and electronic properties of different alloy compositions of bulk WS2(1-x)Se2x. Our results demonstrate the continuous variation of the band structure and the progressive evolution of the valence band splitting at the K points from 420 to 520 meV in bulk WS2(1-x)Se2x. We also carried out scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements and DFT to understand the possible S or Se substitutions variants in WS2(1-x)Se2x alloys, with different local atomic configurations. Our work opens up perspectives for the fine control of the band dispersion in van der Waals materials and demonstrate how the band structure can be tuned in bulk TMDs. The collected information can serve as a reference for future applications.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive Potential-Barrier Affinity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of light rare-earth cubic Laves compounds derived from XMCD experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents electronic and magnetic properties of selected members in the cubic Laves phase series Nd1-xPrxCoNi and Ce0.25Pr0.75CoNi, together with the corresponding binary compositions (NdCo2, NdNi2, PrCo2, PrNi2, CeCo2, CeNi2), using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), density-functional theory, and crystal field multiplet calculations. All transition-metal moments saturate below 1 T, while the rare-earth moments do not saturate even at 5 T, consistent with van Vleck paramagnetic contributions and crystal field suppression. While the sum rules are widely used to extract element-specific magnetic moments from XMCD, we show that for 3d transition metals, their application requires accurate estimates of the number of unoccupied 3d states. We observe a finite magnetic moment on Ni, challenging the common assumption of its nonmagnetic character in Laves phases. The orbital magnetic moments were determined using the spin rules, while the spin moments were estimated from single-ion values from multiplet calculations, due to the invalidity of the spin sum rule for light rare-earth elements. The magnetic moments of Nd and Pr are found to be suppressed relative to their free-ion values, with multiplet theory indicating that this is due to crystal field effects. Our results confirm that Nd and Pr maintain localized 4f3 and 4f2 configurations, respectively, and that their element-specific magnetic moments are robust to rare-earth substitution. Ce, on the other hand, exhibits a tunable mixed-valent ground state with both magnetic 4f1 and nonmagnetic 4f0 components. The relative fraction of these states varies with the electronegativity of the surrounding 3d transition metals, revealing a pathway to tune Ce magnetism via composition. This work establishes a framework for accurately interpreting XMCD in light rare-earth-based intermetallics.</description>

      <title>Metavalent Bonding-Induced Phonon Hardening and Giant Anharmonicity in BeO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is critical for energy applications, yet conventional descriptors often fail to capture the complex interplay between bonding and lattice dynamics. Here, first-principles calculations are used to contrast the thermal transport in covalent zincblende (zb) and metavalent rocksalt (rs) BeO. We find that the metavalent bonding in rs-BeO enhances lattice anharmonicity, activating multi-phonon scattering channels and suppressing phonon transport. This results in an ultralow $\kappa_L$ of 24 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300 K, starkly contrasting with the zb phase (357 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Accurately modeling such strongly anharmonic systems requires explicit inclusion of temperature-dependent phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering. These contributions, negligible in zb-BeO, are essential for high-precision calculations of the severely suppressed $\kappa_L$ in rs-BeO. Finally, we identify three key indicators to guide the discovery of metavalently bonded, incipient-metallic materials: (i) an NaCl-type crystal structure, (ii) large Gr\"uneisen parameters ($\textgreater$2), and (iii) a breakdown of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation. These findings provide microscopic insight into thermal transport suppression by metavalent bonding and offer a predictive framework for identifying promising thermoelectrics and phase-change materials.</description>

      <title>Visible and Terahertz Nonlinear Responses in the Topological Noble Metal Dichalcogenide PdTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear processes can offer pathways to next-generation sensors and frequency mixing devices to overcome modern imaging, detection, and communication challenges. In this article, we report on strong second and third-order nonlinear optical responses in visible and terahertz (THz) light in single crystals of the noble metal dichalcogenide PdTe2. We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation. On the other hand, although the nonlinear responses obtained with THz excitation are not close to this resonance, they can be clearly observed in reflection geometry, even in the presence of broadband excitation, where optical filters are not necessary to observe the odd-order higher harmonic gain. By carefully considering the radiative photocurrent framework of stimulated THz emission, we are able to extract fingerprints of both second- and third-order processes in the THz regime, and show that PdTe2 is a promising material candidate for radio frequency rectification, frequency mixing, and beam focusing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interoperability and cross-validation remains a significant challenge in the computational materials discovery community. In this context, we introduce a common input/output standard designed for internal translation by various workflow managers (AiiDA, PerQueue, Pipeline Pilot, and SimStack) to produce results in a unified schema. This standard aims to enable engine-agnostic workflow execution across multiple density functional theory (DFT) codes, including CASTEP, GPAW, Quantum ESPRESSO, and VASP. As a demonstration, we have implemented a workflow to calculate the open-circuit voltage across several battery cathode materials using the proposed universal input/output schema. We analyze and resolve the challenges of reconciling energetics computed by different DFT engines and document the code-specific idiosyncrasies that make straightforward comparisons difficult. Motivated by these challenges, we outline general design principles for robust automated DFT workflows. This work represents a practical step towards more reproducible and interoperable workflows for high-throughput materials screening, while highlighting challenges of aligning electronic properties, especially for non-pristine structures.</description>

      <title>Human-AI collaborative autonomous synthesis with pulsed laser deposition for remote epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous laboratories typically rely on data-driven decision-making, occasionally with human-in-the-loop oversight to inject domain expertise. Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Fibonacci Forbidden-Word Hamiltonians: From the Golden Chain to the Plastic Chain and Aperiodic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite, scale-aligned hierarchy of one-dimensional, frustration-free Hamiltonians by forbidding the minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word up to length $F_K$, the $K$-th Fibonacci number. The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $\lambda_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \texttt{SS} and \texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $\rho\approx 1.3247$. We propose an energy-entropy scaling where the energy penalty for each new forbidden pattern is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the growth constants from the previous and current rungs, turning the sequence of projectors into an explicit renormalization-group flow from the initial high-entropy phase to the zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point. Algebraically, exact Temperley-Lieb braiding compatibility holds only at the base rung, $K=3$ (which forbids only \texttt{SS}); higher rungs define constrained aperiodic Hamiltonian codes rather than Temperley-Lieb representations. Small instances realized on a D-Wave quantum annealer match these predictions: $K=3$ is trivial, $K=4$ resolves a unit gap with moderate success, and $K\ge 5$ instances require reverse annealing to exceed $99\%$ success, clarifying reduction penalties and embedding variability.</description>

      <title>Large language models in materials science and the need for open-source approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Solid-angle based nearest-neighbor algorithm adapted for systems with low coordination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearest-neighbor identification is central to the analysis of local structure in condensed matter systems. The solid-angle-based nearest-neighbor (SANN) algorithm is widely used offering a parameter-free and computationally efficient alternative to cutoff- or Voronoi-based methods. Unfortunately, however, in systems with low coordination numbers, SANN tends to identify many particles as neighbors that are outside the nearest neighbor shell. Here, we propose a solution to this problem. Specifically, we propose a geometric modification, the ``inscribed circle modification'', that resolves systematic overcounting in low-coordination lattices without introducing free parameters. We benchmark the modified algorithm (mSANN) against Voronoi and the original SANN algorithm in crystalline, quasicrystalline, and heterogeneous systems, and demonstrate that it provides robust and low-cost neighbor identification across both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous resonance in Weyl semimetals: A holographic study of non-linear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider hairy, magnetic black brane solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Dilaton theory with full back-reaction of the scalar and gauge fields and compute the time evolution with time dependent sources. The dual field theory's 't Hooft anomaly leads to long-lived current oscillations in the low temperature limit long after the electric pulse which created these modes has been switched off. We find that, generally, non-linear effects increase the decay rates of long-lived modes by a temperature dependent amount. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the life-time of time-translation symmetry breaking states can be made arbitrarily large if the temperature after the quench is sufficiently small. Experimentally this might be realizable in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Raman fingerprint of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures has prompted great excitement, intense research, but also debate over the past decade. Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Chern insulator in graphene induced by surface electromagnon vacuum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength cavities have emerged as a promising platform to realize strong light-matter coupling in condensed matter systems. Previous studies are limited to dielectric sub-wavelength cavities, which preserve time-reversal symmetry. Here, we lift this constraint by proposing a cavity system based on magneto-electric materials, which host surface electromagnons with non-orthogonal electric field and magnetic field components. The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for controlling Higgs mode and vortex dynamics in superconductors using structured light. We propose a phenomenon analog of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in superconductors, where Higgs waves scatter off light-induced vortex lattices, generating interference patterns akin to matter wave diffraction. We also find that the vortices enable the linear coupling of Higgs mode to the electromagnetic field. This interplay between light-engineered Higgs excitations and emergent vortex textures opens a pathway to probe nonequilibrium superconductivity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Our results bridge quantum optics and condensed matter physics, offering new examples of quantum printing where one uses structured light to manipulate the collective modes in correlated quantum fluids.</description>

Abstract: Rheology, the study of flow, plays a vital role in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food. In this work, we provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental rheological experiments and offer a strategic approach to understand the rheological behavior of any soft condensed material. We emphasize the importance of design of a good rheological experiment, input parameter and analysis of the obtained output parameter. Through the standard design of the experiment and systematic conduction of rheological experiments, we can estimate a broad range of rheological parameters such as viscosity, modulus, stability, yield stress, nonlinear behavior of the material. Furthermore, we also discuss methods for detecting and good practices for reducing some of the common experimental errors that may arise. We also present a comprehensive range of advanced rheological characterization techniques that can be pursued to gain deeper insights into the mechanical behavior and structural evolution of soft materials. Through this work, we attempt to make rheology more accessible to researchers from various domains to incorporate rheology into their characterization study and enable them to confidently navigate rheological studies and contribute to material development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.</description>

Abstract: We present an infrared spectroscopy study of the layered topological semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, a material with a quasi-one-dimensional structure and strong in-plane anisotropy. Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Strongly-Confined CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.</description>

      <title>Perovskite Nanocrystals as Emerging Single-Photon Emitters: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck approach for thermal fluctuations in antiferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Toward Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Force Field for Cathode Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

      <title>ARPES signatures of trions in van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has recently emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations in two-dimensional semiconductors, resolving their dispersion and dynamics in energy-momentum space, including dark exciton states inaccessible to optical techniques. However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient U-Net for Segmentation of Carbide Microstructures in SEM Images of Steel Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.</description>

Abstract: Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), STEM-EBIC, provides direct access to carrier transport at the nanoscale. While well established in bulk SEM geometries, its application to thin TEM lamellae remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic STEM-EBIC study of silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We directly visualize the p-n junctions in thin cross sections and extract effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes as a function of local thickness. The values are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, reflecting pronounced surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Current-voltage measurements further reveal severe deviations from the expected diode-like behavior, which we attribute to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts in the emasurement setup. Our analysis establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative probe of carrier transport in nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e(\bf{r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(\bf{r})$, since the two forms of the kinetic energy, $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$, lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise for interactions. This paper considers the ground state of a system of many interacting particles in an external potential, and presents a resolution in steps. 1) For the kinetic energy all effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions of position $\bf{r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n(\bf{r})$ and are equivalent to an effective single-particle problem with wavefunction $s(\bf{r}) = \sqrt{n(\bf{r})/N}$. 2) Interactions can be considered as potentials acting on particles or interaction fields, e.g., the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields. In each case, there is a mean field part that is a function of the density and a part due to correlation that is uniquely defined. 3) The final results follow from the nature of energy and stress. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the kinetic energy must involve $-\frac{1}{2}s\nabla^2 s$ and interactions in terms of potentials. This leads to density functional theory interpreted as energy density $e(\bf{r})$ equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential at all points $\bf{r}$. However, stress is related to forces, and the only acceptable expressions for the stress field involve the combination $\frac{1}{2}[s\nabla^2 s - |\nabla s|^2]$, and Coulomb interactions in terms of electric fields. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, featuring out-of-plane FE polarization, metallic conductivity, and a finite net magnetization, which together enable electrically tunable spintronic functionalities via FE switching. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve triply-coupled switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ -- a van der Waals metal with intrinsic ferromagnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lifts the nonrelativistic spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment. Furthermore, the interplay between metallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferrimagnetism gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be electrically controlled by FE switching. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in strongly anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs) and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\kappa_l$. Our calculations, including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects in the accurate estimation of $\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure dependence of $\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping-induced superconductivity in group IV elements may enable quantum functionalities in material systems accessible with well-established semiconductor technologies. Non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into C, Si, or Ge can yield superconductivity; however, its origin is obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films and trilayer heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Nuclear Recoils in Silicon Crystals towards Single Electron-Hole Pair Ionization Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.</description>

      <title>Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Giant Response and Harmonic Generation in N\'eel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher order magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the terahertz frequency range. From the effective dynamics, we uncover the strong coupling between the N\'eel vector and the driving field of NSOTs, providing a physical explanation of the gigantic responses at all orders. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>

      <title>Metallic electro-optic effects in topological chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</description>

      <title>Observation of Long-Lifetime Magnon Pairs by Fano Resonance of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mode fluctuations with a long lifetime are essential for quantum information and logic operations in magnonic devices. We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality ferromagnet under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe an \textit{unexpected} Fano resonance in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. We interpret this Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. With the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation well reproduces the observed Fano resonance, indicating the magnon pairs hold a recorded long lifetime.</description>

      <title>Unveiling architectural and optoelectronic synergies in lead-free perovskite/perovskite/kesterite triple-junction monolithic tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.</description>
