      <title>Novel Perturbed b-Metric and Perturbed Extended b-Metric Spaces with Banach-Type Fixed Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new general framework, called \emph{perturbed extended $b$-metric spaces}, denoted by $(X,\mathcal{D}_{\zeta},\hbar)$, which extends the classical and extended $b$-metric structures through the inclusion of an explicit perturbation mapping $\hbar$. This formulation is motivated by the observation that distance measurements in many analytical and applied contexts are often affected by intrinsic or external deviations that cannot be captured by the usual metric-type geometries. We also identify a meaningful specialization arising when the control function $\zeta$ is constant, leading to the notion of a \emph{perturbed $b$-metric space}, introduced here as a natural restriction of the general framework.
  We establish several fundamental properties of spaces of the form $(X,\mathcal{D}_{\zeta},\hbar)$ and develop a Banach-type fixed point theorem in the perturbed extended $b$-metric setting. Conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of a self-map $T:X\to X$ are derived, together with convergence of Picard iterations $T^{n}v \to \vartheta$. Illustrative examples are provided to show that the presence of the perturbation term $\hbar$, together with the influence of the control function $\zeta$, may cause $\mathcal{D}_{\zeta}$ to lose the usual extended $b$-metric behaviour and prevent $\mathcal{D}_{\zeta}$ from satisfying the standard extended $b$-metric axioms. We further discuss natural extensions of this perturbation philosophy to multi-point settings, encompassing $S$-metric spaces and their extended and $S_b$-metric variants. The results presented here open new directions for the study of contractive operators and fixed point theory in generalized metric environments.</description>

      <title>A stochastic optimization algorithm for revenue maximization in a service system with balking customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a service system modeled as a single-server queue, in which the service provider aims to dynamically maximize the expected revenue per unit of time. This is achieved by constructing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that dynamically adjusts the price. A key feature of our modeling framework is that customers may choose to balk - that is, decide not to join - when facing high congestion. A notable strength of our approach is that the revenue-maximizing algorithm relies solely on information about effective arrivals, meaning that only the behavior of customers who choose not to balk is observable and used in decision-making. This results in an elaborate interplay between the pricing policy and the effective arrival process, yielding a non-standard state dependent queueing process. An important contribution of our work concerns a novel Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) procedure that is able to consistently estimate the stationary effective arrival rate. This is further leveraged to construct an iterative algorithm that converges, under mild regularity conditions, to the optimal price with provable asymptotic guarantees.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Natural Power Method and Its Applications to Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the discrete-time natural power method, demonstrating its convergence to the dominant $r$-dimensional subspace corresponding to the $r$ eigenvalues with the largest absolute values. This contrasts with the Oja flow, which targets eigenvalues with the largest real parts. We leverage this property to develop methods for model order reduction and low-rank controller synthesis for discrete-time LTI systems, proving preservation of key system properties. We also extend the low-rank control framework to slowly-varying LTV systems, showing its utility for tracking time-varying dominant subspaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Data Pricing: A Mean Field Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamic pricing mechanism for data products in demand-driven markets through a game-theoretic framework. We develop a three-tier Stackelberg game model to capture the hierarchical strategic interactions among key market entities: a single data buyer, an intermediary broker, and a competitive seller group. To characterize the temporal dynamics of data quality evolution, we establish a coupled system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) where sellers' quality investments interact through mean field effects. Given exogenous pricing policies, we derive approximate Nash equilibrium adjustment strategies for competitive sellers using the mean field game (MFG) approach. The broker's optimal pricing strategy is subsequently established by solving a Stackelberg leadership problem, while the buyer's procurement policy is determined through an optimal control formulation involving conditional mean field forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). Under some regularity conditions, the proposed strategies are shown to collectively form an $(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3)$-Stackelberg equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model to Predict Growth and Treatment for UPS Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a fast-growing cancer Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) grows and how well treatments work. We create a set of equations to describe the tumor's life. We look at four main things: how surgery removes the mass, how the body heals after surgery, the best time to give radiation using on-off rules, and how the immune system fights the cancer. We checked our results against real data, and they match very well. This work helps us predict how a patient will do after treatment.</description>

      <title>Jointly Optimal Policies for Remote Estimation of Autoregressive Markov Processes over Time-Correlated Fading Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a remote estimation setup with an autoregressive (AR) Markov process, a sensor, and a remote estimator. The sensor observes the process and sends encoded observations to the estimator as packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as the Gilbert-Elliot (GE) channel. We assume that the sensor gets to observe the channel state by the ACK/NACK feedback mechanism only when it attempts a transmission while it does not observe the channel state when no transmission attempt is made. The objective is to design a transmission scheduling strategy for the sensor, and an estimation strategy for the estimator that are jointly optimal, i.e., they minimize the expected value of an infinite-horizon cumulative discounted cost defined as the sum of squared estimation error over time and the sensor's transmission power. Since the sensor and the estimator have access to different information sets, this constitutes a decentralized stochastic control problem. We formulate this problem as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) and show the existence of jointly optimal transmission and estimation strategies that have a simple structure. More specifically, an optimal transmission strategy exhibits a threshold structure, i.e., the sensor attempts a transmission only when its belief about the channel being in a good state exceeds a threshold that depends on a certain error. Moreover, an optimal estimation strategy follows a `Kalman-like' update rule. When the channel parameters are unknown, we exploit this structure to design an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to a locally optimal policy. Simulations show the learned policy performs close to a globally optimal one, with about a 5.5% average relative gap across evaluated parameters.</description>

      <title>Sequential Decision-making for Ride-hailing Fleet Control: A Unifying Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified framework for the problem of controlling a fleet of ride-hailing vehicles under stochastic demand. We introduce a sequential decision-making model that consolidates several problem characteristics and can be easily extended to include additional characteristics. To solve the problem, we design an efficient procedure for enumerating all feasible vehicle-to-request assignments, and we introduce scalable techniques to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We construct reusable benchmark instances that are based on real-world data and that capture a range of spatial structures and demand distributions. Our proposed modelling framework, policies and benchmark instances allow us to analyze interactions between problem characteristics that were not previously studied. We find no significant difference between revenue generated by internal combustion engine fleets and fast-charging electric fleets, but both significantly outperform slow-charging electric fleets. We also find that pooling increases the revenue, and reduces revenue variability, for all fleet types. Our contributions can help coordinate the significant research effort that this problem continues to receive.</description>

      <title>Sparsification of sums with respect to convex cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m$ be elements of a convex cone $K$ such that their sum, $e$, is in the relative interior of $K$. An $\epsilon$-sparsification of the sum involves taking a subset of the $x_i$ and reweighting them by positive scalars, so that the resulting sum is $\epsilon$-close to $e$, where error is measured in a relative sense with respect to the order induced by $K$. This generalizes the influential spectral sparsification model for sums of positive semidefinite matrices.
  This paper introduces and studies the sparsification function of a convex cone, which measures, in the worst case over all possible sums from the cone, the smallest size of an $\epsilon$-sparsifier. The linear-sized spectral sparsification theorem of Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava can be viewed as a bound on the sparsification function of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. This result is generalized to a family of convex cones (including all hyperbolicity cones) that admit a $\nu$-logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier with certain additional properties. For these cones, the sparsification function is bounded above by $\lceil4\nu/\epsilon^2\rceil$. For general convex cones that only admit an ordinary $\nu$-logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier, the sparsification function is bounded above by $\lceil(4\nu/\epsilon)^2\rceil$. Furthermore, the paper explores how sparsification functions interact with various convex geometric operations (such as conic lifts), and describes implications of sparsification with respect to cones for certain conic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>On sufficient conditions in the classical problem of the calculus of variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to obtain new sufficient conditions for an extremum in problems of classical calculus of variations. The concept of a set of integrands is introduced. Using this concept, first and second order sufficient conditions for a weak and strong local minimum, as well as an absolute minimum were obtained. Also, this concept, in particular, allows us to define a class of variation problems for which the necessary Weierstrass condition is also sufficient condition. It is shown that the sufficient conditions for a minimum obtained here have new areas of application compared to the known sufficient conditions of the classical calculus of variations. The effectiveness of the obtained results is illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of Regularized Barzilai-Borwein Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularized Barzilai-Borwein (RBB) method represents a promising gradient-based optimization algorithm. In this paper, by splitting the gradient into two parts and analyzing the dynamical system of difference equations governing the ratio of their magnitudes, we establish that the RBB method achieves R-linear convergence for strongly convex quadratic functions of arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, for the two-dimensional case, we provide a concise proof demonstrating that the method exhibits at least R-linear convergence. We propose a simple yet effective adaptive regularization parameter scheme to further improve its performance. A typical numerical example verifies the effectiveness of this scheme.</description>

      <title>Time-integrated Optimal Transport: A Robust Minimax Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing time series in a principled manner requires capturing both temporal alignment and distributional similarity of features. Optimal transport (OT) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, but existing OT-based approaches often depend on manually selected balancing parameters and can be computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce the Time-integrated Optimal Transport (TiOT) framework, which integrates temporal and feature components into a unified objective and yields a well-defined metric on the space of probability measures. This metric preserves fundamental properties of the Wasserstein distance, while avoiding the need for parameter tuning. To address the corresponding computational challenges, we introduce an entropic regularized approximation of TiOT, which can be efficiently solved using a block coordinate descent algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves improved accuracy and stability while maintaining comparable efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization with Desirability and Morris-Mitchell Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing experimental designs in industry are often unplanned, biased, and lack optimal space-filling properties, making them unrepresentative of the input space. This article presents an approach to improve such designs by increasing coverage quality while simultaneously optimizing experimental results. We utilize the intensified Morris-Mitchell criterion, a size-invariant extension of the standard criterion, to quantify and improve input space coverage for existing designs. Using the Python package spotdesirability, we define a multi-objective desirability function that combines predictions from surrogate models (Random Forest) with the Morris-Mitchell improvement into a single score. This approach is demonstrated using a case study from compressor development, optimizing two performance objectives alongside the space-filling criterion. The Python package spotoptim is used for the optimization, and infill-point plots are introduced to visualize the placement of new design points relative to existing ones. This methodology effectively balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off in multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Analysis and Optimal Control of a Dynamic Rating and Matchmaking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale competitive platforms are interacting multi-agent systems in which latent skills drift over time and pairwise interactions are shaped by matchmaking. We study a controlled rating dynamics in the mean-field limit and derive a kinetic description for the joint evolution of skills and ratings. In the Gaussian regime, we prove an exact moment closure and obtain a low-dimensional deterministic state dynamics for rating accuracy. This yields three main insights. First, skill drift imposes an intrinsic ceiling on long-run accuracy (the ``Red Queen'' effect). Second, with period-by-period scale control, the information content of interactions satisfies an invariance principle: under signal-matched scaling, the one-step accuracy transition is independent of matchmaking intensity. Third, the optimal platform policy separates: filtering is implemented by a greedy choice of the gain and rating scale, while matchmaking reduces to a static trade-off between match utility and sorting costs.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of the Consistency Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity analysis informs causal inference by assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to departures from assumptions. The consistency assumption states that there are no hidden versions of treatment and that the outcome arising naturally equals the outcome arising from intervention. When reasoning about the possibility of consistency violations, it can be helpful to distinguish between covariates and versions of treatment. In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis. Whereas many methods for sensitivity analysis are focused on confounding by unmeasured covariates, the methodology of this paper is focused on confounding by hidden versions of treatment. In this paper, new mathematical notation is introduced to support the novel method, and example applications are described.</description>

      <title>First Provable Guarantees for Practical Private FL: Beyond Restrictive Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-$\alpha$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$\alpha$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Sharing with Frictions: Limited Transfers and Costly Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio spectrum suitable for commercial wireless services is limited. A portion of the radio spectrum has been reserved for institutions using it for non-commercial purposes such as federal agencies, defense, public safety bodies and scientific institutions. In order to operate efficiently, these incumbents need clean spectrum access. However, commercial users also want access, and granting them access may materially interfere with the existing activity of the incumbents. Conventional market based mechanisms for allocating scarce resources in this context are problematic. Allowing direct monetary transfers to and from public or scientific institutions risks distorting their non-commercial mission. Moreover, often only the incumbent knows the exact value of the interference it experiences, and, likewise, only commercial users can predict accurately the expected monetary outcome from sharing the resource. Thus, our problem is to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the presence of private information without the use of direct monetary transfers. The problem is not unique to spectrum. Other resources that governments hold in trust share the same feature. We propose a novel mechanism design formulation of the problem, characterize the optimal mechanism and describe some of its qualitative properties.</description>

      <title>Benign Nonconvexity of Synchronization Landscape Induced by Graph Skeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Kuramoto model on a graph and study the geometry of its associated nonconvex energy landscape. This problem admits a dual interpretation. On the one hand, it can be viewed as a geometric optimization problem, seeking configurations of phases that minimize the energy function $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}):=-\sum_{1\leq i,j\neq n}A_{ij}\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)$. On the other hand, the same function serves as the potential governing the dynamics of the classical homogeneous Kuramoto model. A central question is to identify which graphs induce a benign energy landscape, in the sense that every second-order stationary point is a global minimizer, corresponding to the fully synchronized state. In this case, the graph is said to be globally synchronizing. Most existing results establish global synchronization by relating a given graph to the complete graph, which is known to be globally synchronizing, and by showing that graphs sufficiently close to it inherit this property. In contrast, we uncover a fundamentally different mechanism: global synchronization, despite being a collective phenomenon, unfolds on these graphs through a sequential process of local synchronization that propagates along their structural skeletons. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of the phasor geometry at second-order stationary points of the nonconvex energy landscape.</description>

      <title>When Indemnity Insurance Fails: Parametric Coverage under Binding Budget and Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. This paper compares excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.</description>

      <title>Why Smooth Stability Assumptions Fail for ReLU Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear empirically stable. We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.</description>

      <title>Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&amp;P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of identifying the best non-linear estimator of a given regression model involving a neural network using adversarially corrupted samples. We formulate this problem as a DRO problem and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the proposed robust SGLD algorithm. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the robust SGLD estimator outperforms the estimator obtained using vanilla SGLD in terms of test accuracy, which highlights the advantage of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising with perturbed samples.</description>

      <title>Robotic Sorting Systems: Robot Management and Layout Design Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the contemporary logistics industry, automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing production efficiency and expanding industrial scale. Autonomous mobile robots, in particular, have become integral to the modernization efforts in warehouses. One noteworthy application in robotic warehousing is the robotic sorting system (RSS), distinguished by its characteristics such as cost-effectiveness, simplicity, scalability, and adaptable throughput control. While previous research has focused on analyzing the efficiency of RSS, it often assumed an ideal robot management system ignoring potential queuing delays by assuming constant travel times. This study relaxes this assumption and explores the quantitative relationship between RSS configuration parameters and system throughput. We introduce a novel robot traffic management method, named the rhythmic control for sorting scenario (RC-S), for RSS operations, equipped with an estimation formula establishing the relationship between system performance and configurations. Simulations validate that RC-S reduces average service time by 10.3\% compared to the classical cooperative A* algorithm, while also improving throughput and runtime. Based on the performance analysis of RC-S, we further develop a layout optimization model for RSS, considering RSS configuration, desired throughput, and costs, to minimize expenses and determine the best layout. Numerical studies show that at lower throughput levels, facility costs dominate, while at higher throughput levels, labor costs prevail. Additionally, due to traffic efficiency limitations, RSS is well-suited for small-scale operations like end-of-supply-chain distribution centers.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with Memory and Limited Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses an online convex optimization problem where the cost function at each step depends on a history of past decisions (i.e., memory), and the decision maker has access to limited predictions of future cost values within a finite window. The goal is to design an algorithm that minimizes the dynamic regret against the optimal sequence of decisions in hindsight. To this end, we propose a novel predictive algorithm and establish strong theoretical guarantees for its performance. We show that the algorithm's dynamic regret decays exponentially with the length of the prediction window. Our algorithm comprises two general subroutines of independent interest. The first subroutine solves online convex optimization with memory and bandit feedback, achieving a $\sqrt{TV_T}$-dynamic regret, where $V_T$ measures the variation of the optimal decision sequence. The second is a zeroth-order method that attains a linear convergence rate for general convex optimization, matching the best achievable rate of first-order methods. The key to our algorithm is a novel truncated Gaussian smoothing technique when querying the decision points to obtain the predictions. We validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning With Desirability Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The desirability-function approach is a widely adopted method for optimizing multiple-response processes. Kuhn (2016) implemented the packages desirability and desirability2 in the statistical programming language R, but no comparable packages exists for Python. The goal of this article is to provide an introduction to the desirability function approach using the Python package spotdesirability, which is available as part of the sequential parameter optimization framework. After a brief introduction to the desirability function approach, three examples are given that demonstrate how to use the desirability functions for (i) classical optimization, (ii) surrogate-model based optimization, and (iii) hyperparameter tuning. An extended Morris-Mitchell criterion, which allows the computation of the search-space coverage, is proposed and used in a fourth example to handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off in optimization. Finally, infill-diagnostic plots are introduced as a tool to visualize the locations of the infill points with respect to already existing points.</description>

      <title>Superquantile-Gibbs Relaxation for Minima-selection in Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization (BLO) becomes fundamentally more challenging when the lower-level objective admits multiple minimizers. Beyond the unique-minimizer setting, two difficulties arise: (1) evaluating the hyper-objective $F_{\max}$ requires minima selection, i.e., optimizing over a potentially topologically disconnected set; (2) $F_{\max}$ can be discontinuous without structural assumptions. We show both can be circumvented under a local Polyak--Lojasiewicz (PL) condition (PL$^\circ$) on the lower-level objective. Under PL$^\circ$, $F_{\max}$ is Lipschitz continuous and, for every upper-level variable, the set of lower-level minimizers is topologically connected and a closed embedded submanifold of common intrinsic dimension $k$. This intrinsic dimension $k$, rather than the ambient one, governs BLO complexity. We give a method that finds an $(\epsilon,\rho)$-Goldstein stationary point of $F_{\max}$ with at most $\mathcal{O}(m^{8k+9}(\epsilon\rho)^{-8k-10})$ gradient-oracle queries, where $m$ is the upper-level dimension. The key is a Superquantile--Gibbs relaxation that turns minima selection into a sampling problem solvable via Langevin dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to rigorously treat minima selection in BLO and quantify how its complexity scales with the intrinsic dimensionality of the lower-level problem.</description>

      <title>Bus Fleet Electrification Planning Through Logic-Based Benders Decomposition and Restriction Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet sustainability goals and regulatory requirements, transit agencies worldwide are planning partial and full transitions to electric bus fleets. This paper presents a comprehensive and computationally efficient multi-period optimization framework integrating the key decisions required to support such electrification initiatives. Our model is formulated as a two-stage integer program with integer subproblems. These two levels optimize, respectively, yearly fleet sizing and charging infrastructure investments, and hourly vehicle scheduling and charging operations. We develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition algorithm enhanced by several acceleration techniques, including preprocessing, master problem strengthening, and efficient cut separation techniques applied to different relaxations of the operational problem. These accelerations achieve speedups of three orders of magnitude relative to a recently published logic-based Benders decomposition and provide new theoretical and practical insights into Benders cut selection. We also propose a heuristic tailored for long-term, citywide electrification planning. This approach imposes and progressively relaxes additional scheduling constraints derived from auxiliary problems. It delivers high-quality solutions with optimality gaps below 1% for instances an order of magnitude larger than those considered in prior work. We illustrate our model using real data from the Chicago public bus system, providing managerial insights into optimal investment and operational policies.</description>

      <title>Identification with Orthogonal Basis Functions: Convergence Speed, Asymptotic Bias, and Rate-Optimal Pole Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with performance analysis and pole selection problem in identifying linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using orthogonal basis functions (OBFs), a system identification approach that consists of solving least-squares problems and selecting poles within the OBFs. Specifically, we analyze the convergence properties and asymptotic bias of the OBF algorithm, and propose a pole selection algorithm that robustly minimizes the worst-case identification bias, with the bias measured under the $\mathcal{H}_2$ error criterion. Our results include an analytical expression for the convergence rate and an explicit bound on the asymptotic identification bias, which depends on both the true system poles and the preselected model poles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pole selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal, achieving the fundamental lower bound on the identification bias. The algorithm explicitly determines the model poles as the so-called Tsuji points, and the asymptotic identification bias decreases exponentially with the number of basis functions, with the rate of decrease governed by the hyperbolic Chebyshev constant. Numerical experiments validate the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pole selection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solving stochastic climate-economy models: A deep least-squares Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic versions of recursive integrated climate-economy assessment models are essential for studying and quantifying policy decisions under uncertainty. However, as the number of state variables and stochastic shocks increases, solving these models via deterministic grid-based dynamic programming (e.g., value-function iteration / projection on a discretized grid over continuous state variables, typically coupled with discretized shocks) becomes computationally infeasible, and simulation-based methods are needed. The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal stochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend the application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We exemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with five key uncertainty sources highlighted in the literature. To address the complexity and high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network approximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC framework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to efficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hyperparametric Itakura-Saito Nonnegative Matrix Factorization via Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of penalty hyperparameters is a critical aspect in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), since these values control the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and adherence to desired constraints. In this work, we focus on an NMF problem involving the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence, which is particularly effective for extracting low spectral density components from spectrograms of mixed signals, and benefits from the introduction of sparsity constraints. We propose a new algorithm called SHINBO, which introduces a bi-level optimization framework to automatically and adaptively tune the row-dependent penalty hyperparameters, enhancing the ability of IS-NMF to isolate sparse, periodic signals in noisy environments. Experimental results demonstrate that SHINBO achieves accurate spectral decompositions and demonstrates superior performance in both synthetic and real-world applications. In the latter case, SHINBO is particularly useful for noninvasive vibration-based fault detection in rolling bearings, where the desired signal components often reside in high-frequency subbands but are obscured by stronger, spectrally broader noise. By addressing the critical issue of hyperparameter selection, SHINBO improves the state-of-the-art in signal recovery for complex, noise-dominated environments.</description>

      <title>How to Set $\beta_1, \beta_2$ in Adam: An Online Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Adam is one of the most effective optimizer for training large-scale machine learning models, a theoretical understanding of how to optimally set its momentum factors, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, remains largely incomplete.
  Prior works have shown that Adam can be seen as an instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), one of the most important class of algorithms in online learning.
  The prior analyses in these works required setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$, which does not cover the more practical cases with $\beta_1 \neq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  We derive novel, more general analyses that hold for both $\beta_1 \geq \sqrt{\beta_2}$ and $\beta_1 \leq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  In both cases, our results strictly generalize the existing bounds.
  Furthermore, we show that our bounds are tight in the worst case.
  We also prove that setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$ is optimal for an oblivious adversary, but sub-optimal for an non-oblivious adversary.</description>
