      <title>Constrained Search in Imaginary Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimization method for the expectation value of a self-adjoint operator under a finite number of expectation-value constraints based on imaginary-time evolution is introduced. It is formulated for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and uses linearly independent and commuting self-adjoint operators for the constraints. The method is applied to the problem of finding the universal functional of density-functional theory and allows theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping.</description>

      <title>Realizing Scalable Chemical Vapour Deposition of Monolayer Graphene Films on Iron with Concurrent Surface Hardening by in situ Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has been suggested as an ultimately thin functional coating for metallurgical alloys such as steels. However, even on pure iron (Fe), the parent phase of steels, growth of high quality graphene films remains largely elusive to date. We here report scalable chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of high quality monolayer graphene films on Fe substrates. To achieve this, we here elucidate the mechanisms of graphene growth on Fe using complementary in situ X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and in situ near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP XPS) during our scalable CVD conditions. As key factors that set Fe apart from other common graphene CVD catalyst supports such as Ni or Cu, we identify that for Fe (i) carbothermal reduction of persistent Fe-oxides and (ii) kinetic balancing of carbon uptake into the Fe during CVD near the Fe-C eutectoid because of the complex multi-phased Fe-C phase diagram are critical. Additionally, we establish that the carbon uptake into the Fe during graphene CVD is not only important in terms of growth mechanism but can also be advantageously utilized for concurrent surface hardening of the Fe during the graphene CVD process akin to carburization/case hardening. Our work thereby forms a framework for controlled and scalable high-quality monolayer graphene film CVD on Fe incl. the introduction of concurrent surface hardening during graphene CVD.</description>

      <title>Investigating electron conductivity regimes in the bacterial cytochrome wire OmcS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anaerobic bacterium \textit{Geobacter sulfurreducens} produces extracellular, electronically conductive cytochrome polymer wires that are conductive over micron length scales. Structure models from cryo-electron microscopy data show OmcS wires form a linear chain of hemes along the protein wire axis, which is proposed as the structural basis supporting their electronic properties. The geometric arrangement of heme along OmcS wires is conserved in many multiheme c-type cytochromes and other recently discovered microbial cytochrome wires. However, the mechanism by which this arrangement of heme molecules support electron transport through proteins and supramolecular heme wires is unclear. Here, we investigate the site energies, inter-heme coupling, and long-range electronic conductivity within OmcS. We introduce an approach to extract charge carrier site information directly from Kohn-Sham density functional theory, without employing projector schemes. We show that site and coupling energies are highly sensitive to changes in inter-heme geometry and the surrounding electrostatic environment, as intuitively expected. These parameters serve as inputs for a quantum charge carrier model that includes decoherence corrections with which we predict a diffusion coefficient comparable with other organic-based electronic materials. Based on these simulations, we propose that dynamic disorder, particularly due to perturbative inter-heme vibrations allow the carrier to overcome trapping due to the presence of static disorder \textit{via} small frequency-dependent fluctuations. These studies provide insights into molecular and electronic determinants of long-range electronic conductivity in microbial cytochrome wires and highlight design principles for bioinspired, heme-based conductive materials.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Platinum Crystal Growth on Graphene and Reactive Hydrogen-Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pt-functionalized graphene harnesses graphene's exceptional carrier mobility with Pt's catalytic activity for hydrogen sensing, yet the mechanisms of Pt crystal growth, its interaction with graphene, and the consequent impact on hydrogen sensitivity remain incompletely understood. We develop a high-fidelity equivariant machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. Our simulations capture key growth stages-including Pt nucleation, coalescence, and the formation of either polycrystalline clusters or epitaxial thin films-under varying deposition loadings and rates. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman measurements validate the predicted morphologies, revealing small approximately spherical clusters at lower Pt loadings that evolve into slightly thicker, more planar domains with increased loading. Reactive MD shows hydrogen dissociates predominantly on Pt nanostructures at room temperature, with minimal spillover onto pristine graphene. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake increases with Pt loading at a diminishing rate, while reaction kinetics are significantly faster at lower coverages and rapidly decline with increasing loading. DFT calculations indicate undercoordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, which is diminished when hydrogen adsorption depletes Pt electron density, thereby transducing the adsorption events from Pt-surfaces to the Pt-graphene interface. By correlating deposition conditions, nanostructure morphology, and hydrogen sensing dynamics, our findings suggest that moderate Pt loadings can effectively balance sufficient doping with a pronounced Pt-mediated electronic response to graphene. These insights underscore the importance of combining DFT and MLIP simulations with experiments to guide next-generation chemiresistive gas sensor design.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Charge-Transfer at Metal-Organic Interfaces Using Designer Shockley Surface States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic interfaces determine critical processes in organic electronic devices. The frontier molecular orbitals (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO and LUMO) are crucial in determining charge-injection and -collection processes into and from the organic semiconductor films. Here we show that we are able to tune the interfacial electronic structure of a strongly interacting interfacial system formed by adsorption of the electron acceptor 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN, C18N12) on Ag thin films on Cu(111). The thickness-dependent Shockley surface state emerging on this layered metallic system couples to the LUMO, which allows precise control over the energetic position and filling of the charge-transfer interface state relative to the Fermi level (EF). Our ability to tune the interfacial electronic structure while maintaining the structure of the molecular film represents an important step towards designing organic semiconductor interfaces.</description>

      <title>Dial It Down: The Effect of Strongly Interacting Adsorbates on the BiAg2 Rashba Surface State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors interfaced with spin-orbit coupled materials offer a rich playground for fundamental studies of controlling spin dynamics in spintronic devices. The adsorbate-surface interactions at such interfaces play a key role in determining the valence electronic and spin structure and consequently, the device physics as well. Here we present the adsorption and electronic structure of the strong organic electron acceptor 2,7-dinitropyrene-4,5,9,10-tetrone (NO2-PyT, C16H4N2O8) on the Rashba spin-orbit coupled surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111). We show that the strong adsorbate-surface alloy interaction leads to weakening of the electronic coupling between the surface alloy atoms and quench the spin-orbit coupled surface state in BiAg2/Ag(111). Our findings demonstrate an important challenge associated with using molecular adsorbates to tailor the spin polarization in BiAg2/Ag(111), and our work provides guidelines to consider while designing interfacial systems to engineer the spin polarization in Rashba surface alloys.</description>

      <title>Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05539v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moir\'e heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moir\'e devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Cross-functional transferability in universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) has demonstrated the possibility for generalizable learning of the universal potential energy surface. In principle, the accuracy of uMLIPs can be further improved by bridging the model from lower-fidelity datasets to high-fidelity ones. In this work, we analyze the challenge of this transfer learning problem within the CHGNet framework. We show that significant energy scale shifts and poor correlations between GGA and r$^2$SCAN pose challenges to cross-functional data transferability in uMLIPs. By benchmarking different transfer learning approaches on the MP-r$^2$SCAN dataset of 0.24 million structures, we demonstrate the importance of elemental energy referencing in the transfer learning of uMLIPs. By comparing the scaling law with and without the pre-training on a low-fidelity dataset, we show that significant data efficiency can still be achieved through transfer learning, even with a target dataset of sub-million structures. We highlight the importance of proper transfer learning and multi-fidelity learning in creating next-generation uMLIPs on high-fidelity data.</description>

      <title>Electron-Hole Separation Dynamics and Optoelectronic Properties of a PCE10:FOIC Blend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding charge separation dynamics in organic semiconductor blends is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaic solar cells. In this study, we explored the optoelectronic properties and charge separation dynamics of a PCE10:FOIC blend, by combining steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies with high-level DFT calculations. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a significant reduction of the exciton-exciton annihilation recombination rate in the acceptor when incorporated into the blend, compared to its pristine form. This reduction was attributed to a decrease in exciton density within the acceptor, driven by an efficient hole-separation process that was characterized by following the temporal evolution of the transient signals associated with the excited states of the donor when the acceptor was selectively excited within the blend. The analysis of these dynamics enabled the estimation of the hole separation time constant from the acceptor to the donor, yielding a time constant of (1.3 +- 0.3) ps. Additionally, this study allowed the quantification of exciton diffusion and revealed a charge separation efficiency of approximately 60%, providing valuable insights for the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials with enhanced charge separation and improved device efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, crystal and electronic structures, and second harmonic generation of La 4Ge 3S12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal structure of La 4 Ge 3S 12 has been known to be noncentrosymmetric for almost four decades. This characteristic inversion symmetry breaking suggests the presence of nonlinear optical properties. Yet only recently have nonlinear optical phenomena such as second harmonic generation (SHG) been reported in this material. In this study, we synthesized La4Ge3S12 using the direct reaction method and characterized the composition, crystal structure, and electronic structure using electron probe microanalysis, powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimentally measured electronic structure is in line with that obtained using first-principles calculations. In addition, we observed the nonlinear optical properties of La4Ge3S12 in response to an ultrashort infrared pulsed laser. We found that the intensity of the SHG depends quadratically on the intensity of the incident light, mirroring the intrinsic nature of nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-corrected Machine Learning Potentials for 2D van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on message passing neural networks hold promise to enable large-scale atomistic simulations of complex materials with ab initio accuracy. A number of MLIPs trained on energies and forces from density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) functionals have recently been introduced. Here, we benchmark the performance of six dispersion-corrected MLIPs on a dataset of van der Waals heterobilayers containing between 4 and 300 atoms in the moir\'e cell. Using various structure similarity metrics, we compare the relaxed heterostructures to the ground truth DFT results. With some notable exceptions, the model precisions are comparable to the uncertainty on the DFT results stemming from the choice of xc-functional. We further explore how the structural inaccuracies propagate to the electronic properties, and find excellent performance with average errors on band energies as low as 35 meV. Our results demonstrate that recent MLIPs after dispersion corrections are on par with DFT for general vdW heterostructures, and thus justify their application to complex and experimentally relevant 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Memory Driven by Orbital Current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a promising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals such as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In particular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit coupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic devices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light metal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally demonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have realized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel magnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven switching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing orbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>X-ray Strain and Stress Tensor Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic distribution of strain and stress plays a crucial role for the performance, safety, and lifetime of components in aeronautics, automotive and critical infrastructure [1]. While non-destructive methods for measuring the stress close to the surface have long been long established, only a limited number of approaches for depth-resolved measurements based on x-rays or neutrons are available [2]. These feature significant limitations, including long scan times, intricate experimental set-ups, limited spatial resolution or anisotropic gauge volumes with aspect ratios of 1:10 or worse. Here, we present a method that overcomes these limitations and obtains tomographic reconstructions of the full six-dimensional strain and stress tensor components. Using a simple and wide spread experimental set-up that combines x-ray powder diffraction with single axis tomography, we achieve non-destructive determination of depth-resolved strain and stress distributions with isotropic resolution. The presented method could be of interest for additive manufacturing of metals [3,4], battery research [5], in-situ metallurgy [6] and the experimental validation of finite element simulations [7].</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrical Transport Properties of NASICON type Na$_{3}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ti$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.1-0.4) Solid Electrolyte Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the structural, resistivity, impedance, and dielectric studies of isovalent substituted Na$_{3}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ti$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.1--0.4) NASICON type solid electrolyte materials. The Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns shows the monoclinic phase with space group of C 2/c for all the samples. The resistivity analysis shows the Arrhenius-type thermal conduction with an increase in activation energy with doping is explained based on decreased unit cell volume. We use Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) relaxation and space charge or interfacial polarization models to explain the frequency and temperature-dependent variations of electric permittivity. The double relaxation peaks in the dielectric loss data show the two types of relaxation mechanisms of different activation energy. The real ($\epsilon^{'}$) and imaginary ($\epsilon^{''}$) parts of permittivity are fitted using the modified Cole-Cole equation, including the conductivity term, which show the non-Debye type relaxation over the measured frequency and temperature range. The impedance analysis shows the contributions from grain and grain boundary relaxation. The fitting performed using the impedance and constant-phase element (CPE) confirm the non-Debye type relaxation. Moreover, the electric modulus analysis confirms the ionic nature having thermally activated relaxation and the modulus scaling analysis shows a similar type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The modified power law is used to understand the frequency dependence of {\it a.c.} conductivity data. The temperature dependence of exponent ($s$) in modified power law suggests the change in the conduction mechanism from near small polaron tunneling (NSPT) to correlated barrier hopping (CBH) above room temperature. The larger values of $\epsilon$$_{r}$ indicate these materials as a potential candidate for charge-storage devices.</description>

      <title>Comparative Investigation of MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$Br$_x$I$_{1-x}$ Perovskites: Electronic and Structural Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper comparatively investigates the structural and electronic properties of hybrid perovskites MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$PbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ by means of DFT-based calculations. The main aim is to check if the increase in band gap due to substitution of I$^-$ ions with Br$^-$ ions can be overcome by introducing the inorganic SbH$_4^+$ cation. Since the Br$^-$ ions merely enhance structural stability of the perovskite framework and SbH$_4^+$ not only sustains that stability but also reduces the band gap to nearly ideal values and thereby improves electronic performance, these are the leading candidates among them. Of them, the reduced band gap SbH$_4$PbI$_3$ ($\sim$1.37 eV) and the perfectly matched SbH$_4$PbBrI$_2$ with its band gap being exactly 1.51 eV are top prospects for being stable and having high-efficiency solar cell applications. The findings show that SbH$_4^+$-based perovskites have potential for future photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of scanning tunneling spectroscopy beyond one-electron molecular orbitals: can we image molecular orbitals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of experimental spatially resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) maps of close-shell molecules on surfaces is usually interpreted within the framework of oneelectron molecular orbitals. Although this standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental data, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, postulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e., individual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers this contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical question rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical strongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on one-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation of STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a theoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going beyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show why, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with experimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and Tersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate interpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe the process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of many-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be accomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal strain mapping of steel crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their superior fatigue strength, martensitic steels are the material of choice for high cyclic loading applications such as coil springs. However, crack propagation is influenced by residual stresses and their interaction is poorly understood. In fact, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts un-physical singularities in the strain around the crack tip. In this study, we have combined synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, and optical microscopy to map the factual strain fields around crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution. X-ray fluorescence and optical images were co-registered to locate the crack in the x-ray diffraction maps. Observed crystal recovery close to cracks confirmed that the diffraction signal originates at least in parts from the cracks. The retrieved local strain field around the crack was further improved by averaging information over carefully selected diffraction peaks. This procedure provided strain maps around crack tips with a spatial resolution of about 1 micro meter and enabled a prediction of further crack growth.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetism in VPS3 and CrI3 monolayers with the common honeycomb S = 3/2 spin lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials are promising candidates for spintronics and quantum technologies. One extensively studied example is the ferromagnetic (FM) CrI$_3$ monolayer with the honeycomb Cr$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g}^3$, $S$ = 3/2) spin lattice, while VPS$_3$ has a same honeycomb $S$ = 3/2 spin lattice (V$^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^3$) but displays N$\acute{e}$el antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this work, we study the electronic structure and particularly the contrasting magnetism of VPS$_3$ and CrI$_3$ monolayers. We find that VPS$_3$ is a Mott-Hubbard insulator but CrI$_3$ is a charge-transfer insulator, and therefore their magnetic exchange mechanisms are essentially different. The first nearest-neighbor (1NN) direct $d$-$d$ exchange dominates in VPS$_3$, thus leading to a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. However, the formation of vanadium vacancies, associated with instability of the low-valence V$^{2+}$ ions, suppresses the AF coupling and thus strongly reduces the N$\acute{e}$el temperature ($T_{\text{N}}$) in line with the experimental observation. In contrast, our results reveal that the major 1NN $d$-$p$-$d$ superexchanges in CrI$_3$ via different channels give rise to competing FM and AF couplings, ultimately resulting in a weak FM coupling as observed experimentally. After revisiting several important superexchange channels reported in the literature, based on our MLWFs and tight-binding analyses, we note that some antiphase contributions must be subtly and simultaneously considered, and thus we provide a deeper insight into the FM coupling of CrI$_3$. Moreover, we identify and compare the major contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, i.e., a weak shape anisotropy in VPS$_3$ and a relatively strong exchange anisotropy in CrI$_3$.</description>

      <title>Magnetization process in epitaxial Fe$_{85}$Co$_{15}$ thin films via anisotropic magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of the crystalline symmetry on the magnetotransport properties in ferromagnetic alloys are being reexamined in recent years particularly due to the role of the anisotropic magnetoresistance on the electrical detection of magnetization dynamics, which is relevant to estimate spin transport parameters such as the spin Hall angle or the damping constant. In this work we investigated the crystalline dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance in epitaxial Fe85Co15 films and discuss the magnetization process through the magnetotransport properties by varying the relative orientations between the electric current, the external magnetic field and the Fe85Co15 crystallographic directions. We have found that the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio depends on the current direction with respect to the crystal axes of Fe85Co15 and determine a ratio of 0.20 % and 0.17 % when the current is applied along the [110] hard and [100] easy axes, respectively. We fit our experimental data using the Stoner-Wohlfarth model to describe the path followed by the magnetization during the magnetization process and to extract the anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = 21 kJ/m3 and Ku = 11 kJ/m3, which are comparable with reported values from the angular variation of ferromagnetic resonance experiments. Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between the crystalline structure and the magnetotransport properties of FeCo alloys.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced Instability of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Orb-v3: atomistic simulation at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal interatomic potentials. Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a &gt;10x reduction in latency and &gt; 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface.
  This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Guided Inverse Design Using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of a material fundamentally determines its underlying physical, and by extension, its functional properties. Consequently, the ability to identify or generate materials with desired electronic properties would enable the design of tailored functional materials. Traditional approaches relying on human intuition or exhaustive computational screening of known materials remain inefficient and resource-prohibitive for this task. Here, we introduce DOSMatGen, the first instance of a machine learning method which generates crystal structures that match a given desired electronic density of states. DOSMatGen is an E(3)-equivariant joint diffusion framework, and utilizes classifier-free guidance to accurately condition the generated materials on the density of states. Our experiments find this approach can successfully yield materials which are both stable and match closely with the desired density of states. Furthermore, this method is highly flexible and allows for finely controlled generation which can target specific templates or even individual sites within a material. This method enables a more physics-driven approach to designing new materials for applications including catalysts, photovoltaics, and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Altermagnets: From Model to Material Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic symmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their coexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a universal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by tight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that ferroelectric lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the necessary rotational symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically reversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D vanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these compounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization cooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose the magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and its electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D FEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum phase transitions by the cross derivative of the ground state energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the cross derivative of the Gibbs free energy, initially proposed for phase transitions in classical spin models [Phys. Rev. B 101, 165123 (2020)], is extended for quantum systems. We take the spin-1 XXZ chain with anisotropies as an example to demonstrate its effectiveness and convenience for the Gaussian-type quantum phase transitions therein. These higher-order transitions are very challenging to determine by conventional methods. From the cross derivative with respect to the two anisotropic strengths, a single valley structure is observed clearly in each system size. The finite-size extrapolation of the valley depth shows a perfect logarithmic divergence, signaling the onset of a phase transition. Meanwhile, the critical point and the critical exponent for the correlation length are obtained by a power-law fitting of the valley location in each size. The results are well consistent with the best estimations in the literature. Its application to other quantum systems with continuous phase transitions is also discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced Metal to Topological Insulator Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of exact diagonalizations, the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model at quarter-filling in the limit of strong Hubbard on-site repulsion is investigated. We find that the non-interacting metallic state will be turned into a Chern insulator with saturated magnetization under strong correlations. That is, at such a metal-insulator transition, both the topological and the magnetic properties of the system are changed due to spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry in the ground states. According to our findings, this topological phase transition seems to be of first order. Our results illustrate the interesting physics in topological Mott transitions and provide guidance to the search of more interaction-induced topological phases in similar systems.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family with a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around 35 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2 - 5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>

      <title>Entropic modulation of divalent cation transport through porous two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores in two-dimensional materials by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of \textit{monovalent} cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. More specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state with an entropic cost of order $9k_BT$. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The air-water and graphene-water interfaces represent quintessential examples of the liquid-gas and liquid-solid boundaries, respectively. While the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra of these interfaces exhibit certain similarities, a consensus on their signals and interpretations has yet to be reached. Leveraging deep learning, we accessed fully first-principles SFG spectra for both systems, addressing recent experimental discrepancies. Despite both interfaces exhibiting microscopically hydrophobic characteristics, our findings reveal that similarities in SFG signals do not translate into comparable interfacial microscopic properties. Instead, graphene-water and air-water interfaces exhibit fundamental differences in SFG-active thicknesses, hydrogen-bonding networks, and dynamic diffusion behavior. These distinctions underscore the stronger confinements imposed by the solid-liquid interface compared with the weaker constraints of the gas-liquid interface.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency broadband active metasurfaces via reversible metal electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing active metasurfaces with substantial tunability is important for many applications but remains challenging due to difficulties in dynamically tuning light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales. Here, we introduce reversible metal electrodeposition as a versatile approach for enabling active metasurfaces with exceptional tunability across a broad bandwidth. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a dynamic beam-steering device by performing reversible copper (Cu) electrodeposition on a reflective gradient metasurface composed of metal-insulator-metal resonators. By applying different voltages, the Cu atoms can be uniformly and reversibly electrodeposited and stripped around the resonators, effectively controlling the gap-surface plasmon resonances and steering the reflected light. This process experimentally achieved &gt;90% diffraction efficiencies and &gt;60% reflection efficiencies in both specular and anomalous modes, even after thousands of cycles. Moreover, these high efficiencies can be extended from the visible to the near- and mid-infrared regimes, demonstrating the broad versatility of this approach in enabling various active optical and thermal devices with different working wavelengths and bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Infrared phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.</description>

      <title>Influence of doping on non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling doping is key to optimizing graphene for high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, its impact on non-equilibrium carrier lifetimes remains debated. Here, we systematically tune the doping level of quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via potassium deposition and probe its ultrafast carrier dynamics directly in the band structure using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). We find that increased doping lowers both the peak electronic temperature and the cooling rate of Dirac carriers, which we attribute to higher electronic heat capacity and reduced phonon emission phase space. Comparing quasi-freestanding graphene with graphene on a carbon buffer layer reveals faster relaxation in the latter, likely due to additional phonon modes being available for heat dissipation. These findings offer new insights for optimizing graphene in electronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable hot electron extraction in a two-dimensional semiconductor heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers generated by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley Queisser limit, which is challenging to realize mainly due to fast hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient reflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the gate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally distinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we find that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron extraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises from interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the excess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence generates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the conduction band offset with external electric field. Our results provide in-depth insights into design of HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interoperative measurements using magnetic sensors is a valuable technique in cancer surgery for finding magnetic tracers. Here we present a fiber-coupled nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center magnetometer capable of detecting iron oxide suspension (MagTrace from Endomagnetics Ltd.) used in breast cancer surgeries. Detection of an iron mass as low as 0.56~mg has been demonstrated, 100 times less than that of a recommended dose at a maximum distance of 5.8~mm. Detection of an iron concentration as low as 2.8 mg/ml has also been demonstrated, 20 times less than a recommended dose. The maximum working distance from the sensor can be as large as 14.6~mm for higher concentrations. The sensor head has a maximum diameter of 10~mm which would allow it to be used for endoscopy, laparoscopy and interoperative surgery.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets are promising materials for spintronics. The van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ has attracted extensive interest due to its ultra-narrow exciton feature which is closely linked with the magnetic ordering. Here, we use time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to investigate photo-excited carriers in NiPS$_3$. We identify the onset of interband transitions and estimate the exciton dissociation energy from the excitation wavelength and fluence dependence of the transient spectral weight. Our results provide key insights to quantify the exciton characteristics and validate the band structure for NiPS$_3$.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of broken time-reversal symmetry in centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric atomically thin crystals with nonlinear Kerr rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry, together with space-inversion symmetry, is one of the defining properties of crystals, underlying phenomena such as magnetism, topology and non-trivial spin textures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on demand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation. In this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic Kerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with elliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and consequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third harmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken time-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and centrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected third harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our results define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in crystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin, valley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with Millisecond Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice Monte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by capturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous hydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to millisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available length and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in functional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where hydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict hydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its computational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>The distinction between Ice phases VII, VIII and X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice phases VII, VIII and X are all based on a body-centered cubic arrangement of molecules, the differences coming from molecular orientation. There is some debate as to whether these should even be considered distinct phases. The standard definition of a transition between distinct phases involves a discontinuity in any derivative of the free energy. This can be hard to prove experimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models which either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no straightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy model based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII, orientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions in this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the specific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find that a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden within the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a discontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases. We propose that the hidden phase boundary might be demonstrated experimentally by compression of supercooled ice VII.</description>

Abstract: Addressing the intricate challenges in plane elasticity, especially with non-vanishing traction and complex geometries, requires innovative methods. This paper offers a novel approach, drawing inspiration from the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations. Our method applies to domains conformally equivalent to a unit disk or an annulus, focusing on deriving explicit solutions for the displacement field rather than the stress tensor, which distinguishes it from most traditional approaches. We explore solutions for specific classical cases to demonstrate its efficacy, such as a cardioid domain, a ring domain with a shifted hole, and a gear-like structure. This work enhances the toolkit for researchers and practitioners tackling isotropic planar elastostatic challenges with a unified and flexible approach.</description>

Abstract: Copper is a good CO2 electroreduction catalyst as products beyond CO form, but efficiency and selectivity is low. Experiments have shown that admixture of other elements can help, and computational screening studies have pointed out various promising candidates based on the adsorption of a single CO molecule as a descriptor. Our calculations of CO adsorption on surfaces where a first row transition metal atom replaces a Cu atom show that multiple CO molecules, not just one, bind to the substitutional atom. For Fe, Co, and Ni atoms, a decrease in binding energy is found, but the reverse trend, namely increasing bond strength, is found for V, Cr, and Mn and the first three CO molecules. Magnetic moment, charge, and position of the substitutional atom are also strongly affected by the CO adsorption in most cases. Magnetic moment is stepwise reduced to zero, and the outward displacement of the substitutional atom increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming increasingly important due to their high electrical efficiency, the flexible choice of fuels and relatively low emissions of pollutants. However, the increasingly growing demands for electrochemical devices require further performance improvements. Since it is well known that the 3D morphology of the electrodes, which is significantly influenced by the underlying manufacturing process, has a profound impact on the resulting performance, a deeper understanding for the structural changes caused by modifications of the manufacturing process or degradation phenomena is desirable. In the present paper, we investigate the influence of the annealing time and the operating temperature on the 3D morphology of SOFC anodes using 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy, which is segmented into gadolinium-doped ceria, nickel and pore space. In addition, structural differences caused by manufacturing the anode via infiltration or powder technology, respectively, are analyzed quantitatively by means of various geometrical descriptors such as specific surface area, length of triple phase boundary per unit volume, mean geodesic tortuosity, and constrictivity. The computation of these descriptors from 3D image data is carried out both globally as well as locally to quantify the heterogeneity of the anode structure.</description>

      <title>Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown promise as a photovoltaic absorber, but its performance is limited because of defects and impurities that have a direct influence on carrier concentrations. Functional dopants that show lower donor-type or acceptor-type formation energies than naturally occurring defects can help tune the optoelectronic properties of BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and a set of selected impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under both S-poor and S-rich conditions, which remains largely unchanged in the presence of O and H impurities. La and Nb dopants created stable donor-type defects, which made BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and P dopants formed amphoteric defects with relatively high formation energies. This work highlights the difficulty of creating p-type BaZrS3 owing to the low formation energies of donor defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Defect formation energies were also used to compute expected defect concentrations and make comparisons with experimentally reported values. Our dataset of defects in BaZrS3 paves the path for training machine learning models to subsequently perform larger-scale prediction and screening of defects and dopants across many chalcogenide perovskites, including cation-site or anion-site alloys.</description>

Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to significantly accelerate material development and discovery. The data used in MI are derived from both computational and experimental studies; however, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that is trained on the experimental dataset to the compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained datasets to construct materials maps, which visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features, aiming to support experimental researchers. The materials map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements materials property prediction using graph-based representations of material structure and deep learning modeling. Through statistical analysis, we find that the MDL framework using the message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently extracts features reflecting the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we find that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in the prediction of material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>

      <title>The Fermi surface of RuO2 measured by quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ has emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this scenario. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with a range of effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place significant constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$, and strongly suggest that this material is a paramagnet.</description>

      <title>A quantitative theory and atomistic simulation study on the soft-sphere crystal-melt interfacial properties: II. Interfacial free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial free energy ($\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by atomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis focuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that stabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The predicted $\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\gamma$ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative predictions of $\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>SymPlex Plots for Visualizing Properties in High-Dimensional Alloy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional visualization tools such as phase diagrams and convex hulls are ill-suited to visualize multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to their large compositional space that cannot be easily projected onto two dimensions. Here, SymPlex plots are introduced to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional phase spaces of MPEAs. These are polar heatmaps that plot properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen lower-order compositions. SymPlex plots capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability, which can be especially useful to assess processing pathways for additive manufacturing. Thus, SymPlex plots can help guide design of MPEAs by showing connections between compositions and their properties in the high-dimensional phase space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region.</description>

      <title>Electronic Energy Scales of Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</description>

      <title>Competing interlayer interactions in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: From spontaneous electric polarization to quasi-magic angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of moir\'e materials provides a powerful platform for tuning interlayer couplings via the twist angle in systems with large spatial periodicity. In trilayer graphene systems, interlayer couplings at the two interfaces can possibly be tuned separately, and the competition between these interactions can therefore influence the electronic structure in a significant way. In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB) beyond the continuum model, using first-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that at large twist angles, the electronic features of aAB are well described by the interaction between the parabolic bands of the Bernal AB-bilayer and the Dirac bands of the twisted monolayer, resulting in a spontaneous electric polarization in the former that splits the parabolic bands. As the twist angle decreases, the coupling between adjacent layers at the twisted interface becomes dominant, which makes aAB look like twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) interacting with the outer Bernal layer. A moir\'e potential emerges in the TBG-like layers, leading to charge localization, while the outer Bernal layer exhibits charge delocalization with substantial sublattice polarization at the atomic scale. Furthermore, we identify narrow bands with a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle of 1.16 degrees, closely matching the magic angle of TBG. The enhanced electron correlation expected in these narrow bands suggests that aAB is a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as the Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and the Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods, is that these methods are nearly all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips-Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation (which is nearly equivalent). In the all electron reformulation, as part of the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions (plane waves) and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</description>

      <title>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. In our films we identified the infinite-layer 112 and the perovskite 113 phases, with a variety of oxygen stoichiometries in between.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Space AC Josephson Effect and Intervalley Coherence in Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekul\'e distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley current, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby inducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an orbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent dynamics in other 2D materials like twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>
