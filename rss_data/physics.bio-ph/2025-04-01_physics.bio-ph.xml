      <title>Soil-mimicking microfluidic devices reveal restricted flagellar motility of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens under microconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.</description>

      <title>Cell divisions both challenge and refine tissue boundaries in the Drosophila embryo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue boundaries pattern embryos, suppress tumours, and provide directional cues. Tissue boundaries are associated with supracellular cables formed by actin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II. Actomyosin cables generate tension that prevents cell mixing. Whether other cellular behaviours contribute to the formation of linear interfaces between cell populations remains unclear. In the Drosophila embryo, an actomyosin-based boundary separates the ectoderm from the mesectoderm, a group of neuronal and glial progenitors. Mathematical modelling predicted that cell divisions in the ectoderm challenge the mesectoderm-ectoderm (ME) boundary. Consistent with this, suppressing ectoderm cell divisions in vivo prevented cell mixing across the ME boundary when actomyosin-based tension was lost. Our mathematical model also predicted that cell divisions sharpen the ME boundary by reducing tension and increasing cell motility in the ectoderm. We found that inhibiting ectoderm divisions in vivo reduced boundary linearity. Using laser ablation and cell tracking, we demonstrated that cell divisions reduced junctional tension and increased cell movement in the ectoderm. Together, our results reveal that cell divisions facilitate cellular rearrangements to increase fluidity in a novel mechanism for boundary refinement.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter refers to systems composed of self-propelled entities that consume energy to produce motion, exhibiting complex non-equilibrium dynamics that challenge traditional models. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for addressing the complexities of active matter. This review systematically introduces the integration of RL for guiding and controlling active matter systems, focusing on two key aspects: optimal motion strategies for individual active particles and the regulation of collective dynamics in active swarms. We discuss the use of RL to optimize the navigation, foraging, and locomotion strategies for individual active particles. In addition, the application of RL in regulating collective behaviors is also examined, emphasizing its role in facilitating the self-organization and goal-directed control of active swarms. This investigation offers valuable insights into how RL can advance the understanding, manipulation, and control of active matter, paving the way for future developments in fields such as biological systems, robotics, and medical science.</description>

      <title>Hackathons for biophysics education: simulating the cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hackathons are intensive innovation-oriented events where participants work in teams to solve problems or create projects in as little as 24 or 48 hours. These events are common in startup culture, open source communities and mainstream industry. Here we examine how hackathons can be ported to academic teaching, specifically in computational biophysics. We propose hackathons as a teaching modality distinct from traditional courses and structured workshops. In particular, we suggest they can offer a low-stakes platform for students to overcome entry barriers to computational tools or to explore new topics, disciplines, and skills beyond their academic comfort zone. We tested this format in two computational biophysics hackathons on the G\"ottingen campus in 2023 and 2024, providing practical insights and a preliminary evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the 2024 event is the first public hackathon dedicated to Biophysics. This paper explores the benefits of the hackathon format for teachers and researchers and provides guidelines for running a hackathon adapted to a teaching goal.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Intelligence in Propulsion via Flexible Caudal Fins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fish swim with flexible fins that stand in stark contrast to the rigid propulsors of engineered vehicles, though it is unclear whether this flexibility endows animals with a performance advantage. Using numerical simulations of the mechanics of flow-structure interaction (FSI), we found that flexible fins are up to 70\% more efficient than rigid fins. By comparing the dynamics of FSI, we find that the power requirements of rigid fins can be largely attributed to their propensity to generate high-magnitude lateral forces. In contrast, flexible fins achieve high efficiency by a mechanism known as local-force redirection where deformations orient fluid forces in fore-aft and dorso-ventral directions to reduce the power demand of generating lateral forces. These deformations occur at moments in the tail-beat cycle when large velocities and pressure differentials are generated due to the mechanics of the fin and surrounding flow.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations, using an agent based model, of the repulsive and attractive of Kihara models and Hertz interaction model, we investigate the possibilities and limitations for modelling biofilm formation and growth. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.</description>

      <title>Renormalized mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of growing model protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This transition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic thermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains robust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated, primarily due to their occurrence at extremely small spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we employ a functional approach to computationally investigate the impact of relatively slow Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we demonstrate that delayed Pi-release significantly enhances energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our simulation results, obtained through parameter variation, successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance.</description>

      <title>Strong localization blurs criticality of time series for spreading phenomena on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze critical time series of the order parameter generated with active to inactive phase transitions of spreading dynamics running on the top of heterogeneous networks. Different activation mechanisms that govern the dynamics near the critical point were investigated. The time series were analyzed using the visibility graph (VG) method where a disassortative degree correlation of the VG is a signature of criticality. In contrast, assortative correlation is associated with offcritical dynamics. The signature of criticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena, as in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activation driven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-core decomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by the VG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributed hubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for huge systems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presence of rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-critical series, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remain good proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-core activation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures of or, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality of time series.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cognitive Paradoxes in Video Games: A Quantum Mechanical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-mechanical model that bridges the realms of cognition and quantum mechanics, offering a novel perspective on decision-making under risk and perceptual reversals. By integrating quantum theories addressing decision-theoretic anomalies with examples from immersive video games like "Deal or No Deal", we seek to elucidate complex human cognitive behaviours. Study 1 showcases the proposed quantum model's superiority over traditional decision-making approaches using the "Deal or No Deal" video game experiment. In Study 2, we apply our model to bistable perceptions, taking the Necker cube from the Necker game as a primary example. While previous works have hinted at connections between quantum mechanics and cognition, Study 3 provides a more tangible link, likening the physics that underpins quantum tunnelling to an eye blink's role in perceptual reversals. Conclusively, our model displays a promising ability to interpret diverse optical illusions and psychological phenomena, marking a significant stride in understanding human decision making.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

Abstract: Chemical gradients provide the primordial energy for biological functions by driving the mechanical movement of microscopic engines. Their thermodynamic properties remain elusive, especially concerning the dynamic change in energy demand in biological systems. In this article, we derive a constraint relation between the output power and the conversion efficiency for a chemically fueled steady-state rotary motor analogous to the $\mathrm{F}_o$ motor of ATPase. We find that the efficiency at maximum power is half of the maximum quasi static efficiency. These findings shall aid in the understanding of natural chemical engines and inspire the manual design and control of chemically fueled microscale engines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

Abstract: Interferometric-based microscopies stand as powerful label-free approaches for monitoring and characterising chemical reactions and heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single particle sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically characterise how partial coherence affects both the signal contrast and the background noise level; thus, it offers a route to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from single nanoparticles (NPs), irrespective of their size and composition; or the light source used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent ones; while providing higher photon fluxes. Secondly, we demonstrate that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs, but also affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position. Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical synthesis, and biosensing; ushering a new generation of microscopes that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring beam scanning.</description>
