      <title>Bridging high resolution sub-cellular imaging with physiologically relevant engineered tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high-resolution microscopic techniques are crucial for studying cellular structures in cell biology, obtaining such images from thick 3D engineered tissues remains challenging. In this review, we explore advancements in fluorescence microscopy, alongside the use of various fluorescent probes and material processing techniques to address these challenges. We navigate through the diverse array of imaging options available in tissue engineering field, from wide field to super-resolution microscopy, so researchers can make more informed decisions based on the specific tissue and cellular structures of interest. Finally, we provide some recent examples of how traditional limitations on obtaining high-resolution images on sub-cellular architecture within 3D tissues have been overcome by combining imaging advancements with innovative tissue engineering approaches.</description>

      <title>Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.</description>

      <title>Photodynamic, UV-curable and fibre-forming polyvinyl alcohol derivative with broad processability and staining-free antibacterial capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is a promising antibiotic-free strategy for broad-spectrum infection control in chronic wounds, minimising bacterial resistance risks. However, rapid photosensitiser diffusion, tissue staining, side toxicity, and short-lived antimicrobial effects present significant clinical limitations for integrating APDT into wound dressings. To address these challenges, we present the design of a bespoke polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) derivative conjugated with both phenothiazine and methacrylate functionalities, enabling staining-free antibacterial photodynamic effects, cellular tolerability and processability into various wound dressing formats, including films, textile fibres and nanoscale coatings. Tosylation of PVA is leveraged for the covalent coupling of toluidine blue, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the minimal release of TB in vitro. UV-induced network formation is exploited to accomplish cast films and nanoscale integrated wound dressing coatings. UV curing is also successfully coupled with an in-house wet spinning process to realise individual, water-insoluble fibres as the building blocks of fibrous wound dressings. A fluorometric assay supports the generation of reactive oxygen species when the UV-cured samples are exposed to work, but not UV, light, yielding a mean log10 reduction of up to 2.13 in S. aureus, and the complete eradication of P. aeruginosa. Direct and extract cytotoxicity tests with UV-cured films and fibres demonstrate the viability of L929 fibroblasts following 60-min light irradiation and 72-hour cell culture. The bespoke molecular architecture, broad processability and cellular tolerability of this PVA derivative are highly attractive aiming to integrate durable staining-free photodynamic capability in a wide range of healthcare technologies, from chronic wound dressings up to minimally invasive localised therapy.</description>
