      <title>Envy-Free and Efficient Allocations for Graphical Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of finding envy-free allocations for the class of graphical valuations. Graphical valuations were introduced by Christodoulou et. al.(2023) as a structured class of valuations that admit allocations that are envy-free up to any item (EFX). These are valuations where every item is valued by two agents, lending a (simple) graph structure to the utilities, where the agents are vertices and are adjacent if and only if they value a (unique) common item. Finding envy-free allocations for general valuations is known to be computationally intractable even for very special cases: in particular, even for binary valuations, and even for identical valuations with two agents. We show that, for binary graphical valuations, the existence of envy-free allocations can be determined in polynomial time. In contrast, we also show that allowing for even slightly more general utilities {0, 1, d} leads to intractability even for graphical valuations. This motivates other approaches to tractability, and to that end, we exhibit the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem parameterized by the vertex cover number of the graph when the number of distinct utilities is bounded. We also show that, all graphical instances that admit EF allocations also admit one that is non-wasteful. Since EFX allocations are possibly wasteful, we also address the question of determining the price of fairness of EFX allocations. We show that the price of EFX with respect to utilitarian welfare is one for binary utilities, but can be arbitrarily large {0, 1, d} valuations. We also show the hardness of deciding the existence of an EFX allocation which is also welfare-maximizing and of finding a welfare-maximizing allocation within the set of EFX allocations.</description>

      <title>Game Theory with Simulation in the Presence of Unpredictable Randomisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents will be predictable in certain ways that traditional agents are not. Where and how can we leverage this predictability in order to improve social welfare? We study this question in a game-theoretic setting where one agent can pay a fixed cost to simulate the other in order to learn its mixed strategy. As a negative result, we prove that, in contrast to prior work on pure-strategy simulation, enabling mixed-strategy simulation may no longer lead to improved outcomes for both players in all so-called "generalised trust games". In fact, mixed-strategy simulation does not help in any game where the simulatee's action can depend on that of the simulator. We also show that, in general, deciding whether simulation introduces Pareto-improving Nash equilibria in a given game is NP-hard. As positive results, we establish that mixed-strategy simulation can improve social welfare if the simulator has the option to scale their level of trust, if the players face challenges with both trust and coordination, or if maintaining some level of privacy is essential for enabling cooperation.</description>

      <title>Skill vs. Chance Quantification for Popular Card &amp; Board Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a few online and offline games under actual playing conditions. Generally it is expected that initially a player obtains additional skill with experience of playing more number of games and then it should finally saturate. This phase is identified when a player, with the experience of very few games, loses more when she plays against players with much longer history. Then the winning proportion curve moves up and finally it saturates. We benchmark our analysis and discussion against Chess, the most skilled one among the games we consider here. We use proprietary data from actual games (online and offline) as well as experiments for our statistical analysis. In this regard, we show that Rummy has stronger skill and learning effects. Ludo has similar characteristics as Rummy, but at a weaker level. Similarly, a game that is perceived as almost no skill such as Teen Patti indeed presents much less skill in the analysis. In the next section we describe the game structures.</description>

      <title>Fair Division in a Variable Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of fairly dividing a set of indivisible items among a set of agents and consider the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). While in reality, the set of agents and items may vary, previous works have studied static settings, where no change can occur in the system. We initiate and develop a formal model to understand fair division under the variable input setting: here, there is an EF1 allocation that gets disrupted because of the loss/deletion of an item, or the arrival of a new agent, resulting in a near-EF1 allocation. The objective is to perform a sequence of transfers of items between agents to regain EF1 fairness by traversing only via near-EF1 allocations. We refer to this as the EF1-Restoration problem.
  In this work, we present algorithms for the above problem when agents have identical monotone valuations, and items are either all goods or all chores. Both of these algorithms achieve an optimal number of transfers (at most $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of items and agents respectively) for identical additive valuations. Next, we consider a valuation class with graphical structure, introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23), where each item is valued by at most two agents, and hence can be seen as an edge between these two agents in a graph. Here, we consider EF1 orientations on (multi)graphs - allocations in which each item is allocated to an agent who values it. While considering EF1 orientations on multi-graphs with additive binary valuations, we present an optimal algorithm for the EF1-Restoration problem. Finally, for monotone binary valuations, we show that the problem of deciding whether EF1-Restoration is possible is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Temporal Fair Division of Indivisible Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fair division model where indivisible items arrive sequentially, and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably. Previous work on online fair division has shown impossibility results in achieving approximate envy-freeness under these constraints. In contrast, we consider an informed setting where the algorithm has complete knowledge of future items, and aim to ensure that the cumulative allocation at each round satisfies approximate envy-freeness -- which we define as temporal envy-freeness up to one item (TEF1). We focus on settings where items can be exclusively goods or exclusively chores. For goods, while TEF1 allocations may not always exist, we identify several special cases where they do -- two agents, two item types, generalized binary valuations, unimodal preferences -- and provide polynomial-time algorithms for these cases. We also prove that determining the existence of a TEF1 allocation is NP-hard. For chores, we establish analogous results for the special cases, but present a slightly weaker intractability result. We also establish the incompatibility between TEF1 and Pareto-optimality, with the implication that it is intractable to find a TEF1 allocation that maximizes any $p$-mean welfare, even for two agents.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study a principal-agent model in which a principal hires an agent to collect information about an unknown continuous state. The agent acquires a signal whose distribution is centered around the state, controlling the signal's precision at a cost. The principal observes neither the precision nor the signal, but rather, using transfers that can depend on the state, incentivizes the agent to choose high precision and report the signal truthfully. I identify a sufficient and necessary condition on the agent's information structure which ensures that there exists an optimal transfer with a simple cutoff structure: the agent receives a fixed prize when his prediction is close enough to the state and receives nothing otherwise. This condition is mild and applies to all signal distributions commonly used in the literature.</description>
