      <title>Accuracy of extracted optical conductivity by Kramer-Kronig analysis from reflectivity spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kramers-Kronig (KK) analysis has been widely used to extract the optical conductivity spectrum from a broad range of reflectance spectrum obtained from far-infrared to ultraviolet frequency ranges. In this study, we present how measurement uncertainty in the reflectivity spectrum affects the extracted optical conductivity spectrum obtained through KK analysis. We consider realistic uncertainties that can easily occur in reflectance measurement environments: (1) a rigid shift of the absolute reflectance in the whole measurement frequency window, and (2) a linear decrement of reflectance with increasing frequency. Our investigation reveals that the reliability of the extracted optical conductivity spectrum, especially in the lower-frequency range, should be carefully addressed, particularly when the reflectance is above approximately 95 %.</description>

      <title>Optical Neural Engine for Solving Scientific Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is the cornerstone of scientific research and development. Data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches are emerging to accelerate time-consuming and computation-intensive numerical simulations of PDEs. Although optical systems offer high-throughput and energy-efficient ML hardware, there is no demonstration of utilizing them for solving PDEs. Here, we present an optical neural engine (ONE) architecture combining diffractive optical neural networks for Fourier space processing and optical crossbar structures for real space processing to solve time-dependent and time-independent PDEs in diverse disciplines, including Darcy flow equation, the magnetostatic Poisson equation in demagnetization, the Navier-Stokes equation in incompressible fluid, Maxwell's equations in nanophotonic metasurfaces, and coupled PDEs in a multiphysics system. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capability of the ONE architecture, which not only leverages the advantages of high-performance dual-space processing for outperforming traditional PDE solvers and being comparable with state-of-the-art ML models but also can be implemented using optical computing hardware with unique features of low-energy and highly parallel constant-time processing irrespective of model scales and real-time reconfigurability for tackling multiple tasks with the same architecture. The demonstrated architecture offers a versatile and powerful platform for large-scale scientific and engineering computations.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of Mie resonators with minimal backscattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation and engineering of light scattering by resonant nanostructures is one of the central problems in optics and photonics. In this work, we theoretically study the effect of suppressed back-scattering of dielectric nanoantenna. We employed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy to identify the geometries of circular dielectric structures with minimized backward scattering cross section. Zero back-scattering is achieved due to generalized Kerker effect and multipole cancellation condition. We found a set of geometries and shapes of the nanoantenna having back-scattering intensity close to zero. With help of clustering algorithms, all the found geometries fall separated into several groups according to their multipolar content. While the optical properties of scatterers in each group were similar due to similar multipolar content, their shapes can be significantly different which stresses the ambiguity of free-form optimization problem. We believe that the obtained results and found possible classes on generalized Kerker nanoantenna can help in designing nanophotonic structures such as antireflective metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Photoactivation of color centers induced by laser irradiation in ion-implanted diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split-vacancy color centers in diamond are promising solid state platforms for the implementation of photonic quantum technologies. These luminescent defects are commonly fabricated upon low energy ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing. Their technological uptake will require the availability of reliable methods for the controlled, large scale production of localized individual photon emitters. This task is partially achieved by controlled ion implantation to introduce selected impurities in the host material, and requires the development of challenging beam focusing or collimation procedures coupled with single-ion detection techniques. We report on protocol for the direct optical activation of split-vacancy color centers in diamond via localized processing with continuous wave laser at mW optical powers. We demonstrate the activation of photoluminescent Mg- and Sn-related centers at both the ensemble and single-photon emitter level in ion-implanted, high-purity diamond crystals without further thermal processing. The proposed lithographic method enables the activation of individual color centers at specific positions of a large area sample by means of a relatively inexpensive equipment offering the real-time, in situ monitoring of the process.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic model for laser swelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of surface layers of a glassy material heated by a laser pulse above the glass transition temperature and cooled by heat diffusion is considered as the flow of a stretchable viscous fluid. The strong dependence of viscosity on temperature and pressure leads to the appearance of a hump with reduced density. This hydrodynamic model for laser swelling is formulated in general form. We present a 1D solution for laser swelling of a thin glassy polymer film on a strongly thermally conductive substrate for laser pulses long enough that the sound confinement effect can be neglected. It is shown that within this condition the evolution of the film thickness over time can be addressed using a second-order ordinary differential equation. It is also shown that in some cases this equation can be reduced to a first-order differential equation resembling the phenomenological equation of the previously published relaxation model of laser swelling. The main features of the dependence of laser swelling on laser fluence, namely the threshold at low fluencies and saturation at high fluencies, have been clarified allowing for the dependence of viscosity on pressure, which was not taken into account in the previous theoretical studies of laser swelling. Typical regimes of the film thickness evolution are considered and compared to existing experimental data.</description>

      <title>A spiral sampling method for calculating the complex orbital angular momentum spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OAM spectrum reflects the OAM component included in measured light field which is crucial in OAM -based application. However, traditional definition-based OAM spectrum algorithm is extraordinary time-consuming and limited to prior knowledge severely. To overcome it, in this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate the complex spectrum. After spiral sampling and Fourier transform, one can retrieve the radial coefficient of arbitrary OAM component by proper filtering and inverse Fourier transform. The simulation results reveal that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between retrieved one and target could reach at 0.0221 and 0.0199 on average for amplitude and phase respectively after normalized. This method could provide a powerful tool for future OAM-based and application.</description>

      <title>Resonant EO combs: Beyond the standard phase noise model of frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resonant electro-optic (EO) frequency comb is generated through electro-optic modulation of laser light within an optical resonator. Compared to cavity-less EO combs generated in a single pass through a modulator, resonant EO combs can produce broader spectra with lower radio frequency (RF) power and offer a measure of noise filtering beyond the cavity's linewidth. Understanding, measuring, and suppressing the sources of phase noise in resonant EO combs is crucial for their applications in metrology, astrophotonics, optical clock generation, and fiber-optic communication. According to the standard phase noise model of frequency combs, only two variables - the common mode offset and repetition rate phase noise - are needed to fully describe the phase noise of comb lines. However, in this work we demonstrate analytically, numerically, and experimentally that this standard model breaks down for resonant EO combs at short timescales (high frequencies) and under certain comb parameters. Specifically, a third phase noise component emerges. Consequently, resonant EO combs feature qualitatively different phase noise from their cavity-less counterparts and may not exhibit the anticipated noise filtering. A more complete description of the deviations from the standard phase noise model is critical to accurately predict the performance of frequency combs. The description presented here paves the way for improved designs tailored to applications such as super-continuum generation and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Multichannel, ultra-wideband Rydberg Electrometry with an Optical Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Rydberg atoms have shown tremendous potential to serve as accurate and sensitive detectors of microwaves and millimeter waves, their response is generally limited to a single narrow frequency band around a chosen microwave transition. As a result, their potential to serve as agile and wideband electromagnetic receivers has not been fully realized. Here we demonstrate the use of a mid-infrared, frequency agile optical frequency comb as the coupling laser for three-photon Rydberg atom electrometry. This approach allows us to simultaneously prepare as many as seven individual Rydberg states, allowing for multichannel detection across a frequency range from 1 GHz to 40 GHz. The generality and flexibility of this method for wideband multiplexing is anticipated to have transformative effects in the field of Rydberg electrometry, paving the way for advanced information coding and arbitrary signal detection.</description>

      <title>Photonic bands and normal mode splitting in optical lattices interacting with cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong collective interaction of atoms with an optical cavity causes normal mode splitting of the cavity's resonances, whose width is given by the collective coupling strength. At low optical density of the atomic cloud the intensity distribution of light in the cavity is ruled by the cavity's mode function, which is solely determined by its geometry. In this regime the dynamics of the coupled atom-cavity system is conveniently described by the open Dicke model, which we apply to calculating normal mode splitting generated by periodically ordered clouds in linear and ring cavities. We also show how to use normal mode splitting as witness for Wannier-Bloch oscillations in the tight-binding limit. At high optical density the atomic distribution contributes to shaping the mode function. This regime escapes the open Dicke model, but can be treated by a transfer matrix model provided the saturation parameter is low. Applying this latter model to an atomic cloud periodically ordered into a one-dimensional lattice, we observe the formation of photonic bands gaps competing with the normal mode splitting. We discuss the limitations of both models and point out possible pathways to generalized theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and numerically investigate a novel compact planar microcavity design based on a high-index dielectric slab waveguide with embedded monolayer semiconductor. In comparison to more traditional vertical Bragg microcavities, our design relies on the transmission of guided optical modes and achieves strong exciton-photon coupling in a chip-compatible and compact geometry with sub-100 nm thickness. We show that Rabi splitting values of more than 70 meV can be obtained in planar microcavities with the total length below 5 um. Further, we reveal the dependence of Rabi splitting on the dimensions of the structure and explain it with a simple theoretical model. Our results contribute towards the development of novel compact 2D semiconductor-based components for integrated photonic circuits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum transduction is essential for future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient frequency conversion. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. This Letter introduces a framework to describe the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments and capable of unveiling the ability of molecular modulation to preserve entanglement.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

Abstract: Programmable optical circuits form a key part of quantum technologies today, ranging from transceivers for quantum communication to integrated photonic chips for quantum information processing. As the size of such circuits is increased, maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging, leading to a reduction in the quality of the operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we show how embedding an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability over the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear optical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial multi-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these circuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show how their programmability allows us to turn the multi-mode fibre itself into a generalised multi-outcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. Finally, we discuss the scalability of our approach, numerically showing how a high circuit fidelity can be achieved with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode-mixer. Our work serves as an alternative yet powerful approach for realising precise control over high-dimensional quantum states of light, with clear applications in next-generation quantum communication and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous illumination image enhancement under ex-tremely low visibility condition</title>

Abstract: Imaging through dense fog presents unique challenges, with essential visual information crucial for applications like object detection and recognition obscured, thereby hindering conventional image processing methods. Despite improvements through neural network-based approaches, these techniques falter under extremely low visibility conditions exacerbated by inhomogeneous illumination, which degrades deep learning performance due to inconsistent signal intensities. We introduce in this paper a novel method that adaptively filters background illumination based on Structural Differential and Integral Filtering (SDIF) to enhance only vital signal information. The grayscale banding is eliminated by incorporating a visual optimization strategy based on image gradients. Maximum Histogram Equalization (MHE) is used to achieve high contrast while maintaining fidelity to the original content. We evaluated our algorithm using data collected from both a fog chamber and outdoor environments, and performed comparative analyses with existing methods. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances signal clarity under extremely low visibility conditions and out-performs existing techniques, offering substantial improvements for deep fog imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A framework to compute resonances arising from multiple scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi-scattering framework is coupled with the state-of-the-art adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. We tie the AAA algorithm into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi-scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton-polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi-scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.</description>
