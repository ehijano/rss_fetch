      <title>Anderson localized states for the quasi-periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb Z^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish large sets of Anderson localized states for the quasi-periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb Z^d$, thus extending Anderson localization from the linear (cf. Bourgain [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007]) to a nonlinear setting, and the random (cf. Bourgain-Wang [JEMS 10(1), 1--45, 2008]) to a deterministic setting. Among the main ingredients are a new Diophantine estimate of quasi-periodic functions in arbitrarily dimensional phase space, and the application of Bourgain's geometric lemma in [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007].</description>

      <title>The investigation of singular integro-differential equations relating to adhesive contact problems of the theory of viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact and approximate solutions of singular integro-differential equations relating to the problems of interaction of an elastic thin finite or infinite non-homogeneous patch with a plate are considered, provided that the materials of plate and patch possess the creep property. Using the method of orthogonal polynomials the problem is reduced to the infinite system of Volterra integral equations, and using the method of integral transformations this problem is reduced to the different boundary value problems of the theory of analytic functions. An asymptotic analysis is also performed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrable Systems on a Classical Integrable Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the framework for quantum integrable systems on an integrable classical background. We call them hybrid quantum integrable systems (hybrid integrable systems), and we show that they occur naturally in the semiclassical limit of quantum integrable systems. We start with an outline of the concept of hybrid dynamical systems. Then we give several examples of hybrid integrable systems. The first series of examples is a class of hybrid integrable systems that appear in the semiclassical limit of quantum spin chains. Then we look at the semiclassical limit of the quantum spin Calogero--Moser system. The result is a hybrid integrable system driven by usual classical Calogero--Moser (CM) dynamics. This system at the fixed point of the multi-time classical dynamics CM system gives commuting spin Hamiltonians of Haldane--Shastry model.</description>

      <title>The adhesive contact problem for a piecewise-homogeneous orthotropic plate with an elastic patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A piecewise-homogeneous elastic orthotropic plate, reinforced with a finite patch of the wedgeshaped, which meets the interface at a right angle and is loaded with tangential and normal forces is considered. By using methods of the theory of analytic functions, the problem is reduced to the system of singular integro-differential equations (SIDE) with fixed singularity. Under tension-compression of patch by using an integral transformation a Riemann problem is obtained, the solution of which is presented in explicit form. The tangential contact stresses along the contact line are determined and their asymptotic behavior in the neighborhood of singular points is established.</description>

Abstract: We show how to deform a Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis manifold by means of a closed 2-form. Then we interpret this procedure in the context of quasi-Lie bialgebroids, as a particular case of the so called twisting of a quasi-Lie bialgebroid. Finally, we frame our result in the setting of Courant algebroids and Dirac structures.</description>

      <title>The set of Kirkwood-Dirac positive states is almost always minimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum information is determining quantum-classical boundaries. A useful notion of classicality is provided by the quasiprobability formulation of quantum theory. In this framework, a state is called classical if it is represented by a quasiprobability distribution that is positive, and thus a probability distribution. In recent years, the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distributions have gained much interest due to their numerous applications in modern quantum-information research. A particular advantage of the KD distributions is that they can be defined with respect to arbitrary observables. Here, we show that if two observables are picked at random, the set of classical states of the resulting KD distribution is a simple polytope of minimal size. When the Hilbert space is of dimension $d$, this polytope is of dimension $2d-1$ and has $2d$ known vertices. Our result implies, $\textit{e.g.}$, that almost all KD distributions have resource theories in which the free states form a small and simple set.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Theorem for stabilizer states and quantum designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the symmetry group of the stabilizer polytope for any number $n$ of systems and any prime local dimension $d$. In the qubit case, the symmetry group coincides with the linear and anti-linear Clifford operations. In the case of qudits, the structure is somewhat richer: for $n=1$, it is a wreath product of permutations of bases and permutations of the elements within each basis. For $n&gt;1$, the symmetries are given by affine symplectic similitudes. These are the affine maps that preserve the symplectic form of the underlying discrete phase space up to a non-zero multiplier. We phrase these results with respect to a number of a priori different notions of "symmetry'', including Kadison symmetries (bijections that are compatible with convex combinations), Wigner symmetries (bijections that preserve inner products), and symmetries realized by an action on Hilbert space. Going beyond stabilizer states, we extend an observation of Heinrich and Gross (Ref. [25]) and show that the symmetries of fairly general sets of Hermitian operators are constrained by certain moments. In particular: the symmetries of a set that behaves like a 3-design preserve Jordan products and are therefore realized by conjugation with unitaries or anti-unitaries. (The structure constants of the Jordan algebra are encoded in an order-three tensor, which we connect to the third moments of a design). This generalizes Kadison's formulation of the classic Wigner Theorem on quantum mechanical symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We obtain rigorous large time asymptotics for the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the soliton free case by extending the nonlinear steepest descent method to genus 1 surfaces. The methods presented in this paper pave the way to rigorous analysis of other integrable equations on the torus and enables asymptotic analysis on different regimes of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider higher symmetries and operator symmetries of linear partial differential equations. The higher symmetries form a Lie algebra, and operator ones form an associative algebra. The relationship between these symmetries is established. We show that symmetries of linear equations sometimes generate symmetries of nonlinear ones. New symmetries of two-dimensional stationary equations of gas dynamics are found.</description>

      <title>On the Laplace operator with a weak magnetic field in exterior domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic Laplacian in a two-dimensional exterior domain with Neumann boundary condition and uniform magnetic field. For the exterior of the disk we establish accurate asymptotics of the low-lying eigenvalues in the weak magnetic field limit. For the exterior of a star-shaped domain, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the lowest eigenvalue in the weak field limit, involving the $4$-moment, and optimal for the case of the disk. Moreover, we prove that, for moderate magnetic fields, the exterior of the disk is a local maximizer for the lowest eigenvalue under a $p$-moment constraint.</description>

      <title>The dynamic of the positons for the reverse space-time nonlocal short pulse equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Darboux transformation (DT) of the reverse space-time (RST) nonlocal short pulse equation is constructed by a hodograph transformation and the eigenfunctions of its Lax pair. The multi-soliton solutions of the RST nonlocal short pulse equation are produced through the DT, which can be expressed in terms of determinant representation. By taking different values of eigenvalues, bounded soliton solutions and unbounded soliton solutions can be obtained. In addition, based on the degenerate Darboux transformation, the $N$-positon solutions of the RST nonlocal short pulse equation are computed from the determinant expression of the multi-soliton solution. Furthermore, different kinds of mixed solutions are also presented, and the interaction properties between positons and solitons are investigated.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness and scattering for the 3D incompressible Euler-Coriolis system with sufficiently small, regular and suitably localized initial data. Equivalently, we obtain the asymptotic stability for "rigid body" rotational solutions to the pure Euler equations. This extends the recent work of Guo, Pausader and Widmayer to the general non-axisymmetric setting.</description>

Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined unramified Gromov-Witten invariants. For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

      <title>Smooth Solutions of the tt* Equation: A Numerical Aided Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important special class of the tt* equations are the tt*-Toda equations. Guest et al. have given comprehensive studies on the tt*-Toda equations in a series of papers. The fine asymptotics for a large class of solutions of a special tt*-Toda equation, the case 4a in their classification, have been obtained in a paper (Commun. Math. Phys. 374, 923-973) in the series. Most of these formulas are obtained with elaborate reasoning and the calculations involved are lengthy. There are concerns about these formulas if they have not been verified by other methods. The first part of this paper is devoted to the numerical verification of these fine asymptotics. In fact, the numerical studies can do more and should do more. A natural question is whether we can find more such beautiful formulas in the tt* equation via numerical study. The second part of this paper is devoted to the numerical study of the fine asymptotics of the solutions in an enlarged class defined from the Stoke data side. All the fine asymptotics of the solutions in the enlarged class are found by the numerical study. The success of the numerical study is largely due to the truncation structures of the tt* equation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <title>Ground state configurations of systems of interacting particles in one dimension under the potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 1979 paper, Ventevogel and Nijboer showed that classical point particles interacting via the pair potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$ are not equally spaced in their ground state in one dimension when the particle density is high, in contrast with many other potentials such as inverse power laws or Gaussians. We prove that when the density is $\rho={n}/{\sqrt{2}}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the configuration that places $n$ particles at each point of $\sqrt{2}\mathbb{Z}$ minimises the average potential energy per particle and is therefore the exact ground state. In other words, the particles form clusters, while the clusters do not approach each other as the density increases; instead they maintain a fixed spacing. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of such a ground state for a naturally occurring potential function. We conclude with some comments on possible generalisations to potentials of the form $f_\alpha(x)=\left(1+x^\alpha\right)^{-1}$ for $\alpha&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study discrete analogues of an exact sequence of vector bundles introduced by M. Atiyah in 1957, associated to any smooth principal $G$-bundle $\pi:Q\rightarrow Q/G$. In the original setting, the splittings of the exact sequence correspond to connections on the principal bundle $\pi$. The discrete analogues that we consider here can be studied in two different categories: the category of fiber bundles with a (chosen) section, FBS, and the category of local Lie groupoids, lLgpdC. In FBS we find a correspondence between a) (semi-local) splittings of the discrete Atiyah sequence (DAS) of $\pi$, b) discrete connections on the same bundle $\pi$, and c) isomorphisms of the DAS with certain fiber product extensions in FBS. We see that the right splittings of the DAS (in FBS) are not necessarily right splittings in lLgpdC: we use this obstruction to define the discrete curvature of a discrete connection. Then, there is a correspondence between the splittings of the DAS in lLgpdC and discrete connections with trivial discrete curvature. We also introduce a semidirect product between (some) local Lie groupoids and prove that there is a correspondence between semidirect product extensions and splittings of the DAS in lLgpdC.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Sandwiched R\'enyi Divergence of Order 1/2 to 1 as Strong Converse Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, and its induced quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy and quantum R\'enyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence with R\'enyi parameter in the interval $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimizers for the Dirac-Fock model of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>Joint evolution of a Lorentz-covariant massless scalar field and its point-charge source in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the static solution of the Cauchy problem for a massless real scalar field that is sourced by a point charge in $1+1$ dimensions is asymptotically stable under perturbation by compactly-supported radiation. This behavior is due to the process of back-reaction. Taking the approach of Kiessling, we rigorously derive the expression for the force on the particle from the principle of total energy-momentum conservation. We provide a simple, closed form for the particle's self-action, and show that it is restorative in this model , i.e. proportional to negative velocity, and causes the charge to return to rest after the radiation passes through. We establish these results by studying the joint evolution problem for the particle-scalar field system, and proving its global well-posedness and the claimed asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum information spreading in generalised dual-unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\"ossler system is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, generating a chaotic attractor which, by the numerical evidence, arises by a period-doubling route to chaos. In this paper we state and prove a topological criterion for the existence of an attractor for the R\"ossler system - and then analyze the dynamics of the non-wandering set by reducing the flow to the dynamics of a well-known one dimensional model: the Quadratic Family, $x^2+c$, $-2\leq c\leq\frac{1}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Short-time expansion of one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with heterogeneous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a short-time expansion for one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with spatially dependent diffusion coefficients, derived from stochastic processes with Gaussian white noise, for general values of the discretization parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ of the stochastic integral. The kernel of the Fokker-Planck equation (the propagator) can be expressed as a product of a singular and a regular term. While the singular term can be given in closed form, the regular term can be computed from a Taylor expansion whose coefficients obey simple ordinary differential equations. We illustrate the application of our approach with examples taken from statistical physics and biophysics. Further, we show how our formalism allows to define a class of stochastic equations which can be treated exactly. The convergence of the expansion cannot be guaranteed independently from the discretization parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</description>

Abstract: We study a specific class of CFTs that involve coupled free fermions, arising from parafermion CFTs and lattice constructions. We analyse their representation spaces and the underlying exclusion statistics of coupled free fermions using specific bases. In one particular case, we reveal an unexpected connection between the coset construction of parafermions, the lattice construction, and and orbifold thereof. This connection is supported by proving a range of character identities within the context of coupled free fermions. Simultaneously, we obtain explicit expressions of certain string functions in terms of Dedekind eta functions.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; however, it has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A timelike membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon that is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the membrane paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Informationally overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one operates a classical reduction of the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: as an example, for a unitary dynamics, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which thus exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative qubit evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>
