      <title>Marketron Through the Looking Glass: From Equity Dynamics to Option Pricing in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Marketron model, introduced by [Halperin, Itkin, 2025], describes price formation in inelastic markets as the nonlinear diffusion of a quasiparticle (the marketron) in a multidimensional space comprising the log-price $x$, a memory variable $y$ encoding past money flows, and unobservable return predictors $z$. While the original work calibrated the model to S\&amp;P 500 time series data, this paper extends the framework to option markets - a fundamentally distinct challenge due to market incompleteness stemming from non-tradable state variables. We develop a utility-based pricing approach that constructs a risk-adjusted measure via the dual solution of an optimal investment problem. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, though computationally formidable, is solved using a novel methodology enabling efficient calibration even on standard laptop hardware. Having done that, we look at the additional question to answer: whether the Marketron model, calibrated to market option prices, can simultaneously reproduce the statistical properties of the underlying asset's log-returns. We discuss our results in view of the long-standing challenge in quantitative finance of developing an unified framework capable of jointly capturing equity returns, option smile dynamics, and potentially volatility index behavior.</description>

      <title>Language of Persuasion and Misrepresentation in Business Communication: A Textual Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings, detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data, and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Hedging of Options with Implied Volatility Surface Feedback Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamic hedging scheme for S&amp;P 500 options, where rebalancing decisions are enhanced by integrating information about the implied volatility surface dynamics. The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep policy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm. The favorable inclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface allows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as practitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation and backtesting experiments. The outperformance is more pronounced in the presence of transaction costs.</description>

      <title>ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multi-agent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.
