      <title>Stability of discrete-symmetry flocks: sandwich state, traveling domains and motility-induced pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar flocks in discrete active systems are often assumed to be robust, yet recent studies reveal their fragility under both imposed and spontaneous fluctuations. Here, we revisit the four-state active Potts model (APM) and show that its globally ordered phase is metastable across a broad swath of parameter space. Small counter-propagating droplets disrupt the flocking phase by inducing a persistent sandwich state, where the droplet-induced opposite-polarity lane remains embedded within the original flock, particularly pronounced at low noise, influenced by spatial anisotropy. In contrast, small transversely propagating droplets, when introduced into the flock, can trigger complete phase reversal due to their alignment orthogonal to the dominant flow and their enhanced persistence. At low diffusion and strong self-propulsion, such transverse droplets also emerge spontaneously, fragmenting the flock into multiple traveling domains and giving rise to a short-range order (SRO) regime. We further identify a motility-induced pinning (MIP) transition in small diffusion and low-temperature regimes when particles of opposite polarity interact, flip their state, hop, and pin an interface. Our comprehensive phase diagrams, encompassing full reversal, sandwich coexistence, stripe bands, SRO, and MIP, delineate how thermal fluctuations, self-propulsion strength, and diffusion govern flock stability in discrete active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Thermodynamic Bounds on Cross-Coupling Transport in Chiral Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the Leslie effects that describe the dynamic cross-couplings in chiral liquid crystals driven by the transport of heat, electric charge, and mass. The Ericksen--Leslie model is extended in the linear response framework by representing nematic order with the Q-tensor. Subsequently, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation is applied to identify the upper bounds of the Leslie cross-coupling coefficients. We reveal that the cross-coupling coefficients are dependent on the scalar order parameter and vanish in the isotropic phase. In addition, the chirality of the phase allows torque induced by a transport current parallel to the director. The mutual signs of the Leslie thermohydrodynamic and thermomechanical coefficients are likely to be opposite in calamitic liquid crystals, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Our model is applicable to the thermal, chemical, and electrical Leslie effects. The present arguments suggest that a common underlying principle may govern both the Leslie effects and the thermal Edelstein effect in chiral solid crystals attributed to chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha&lt;\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>The effects of knot topology on the collapse of active polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to study tangentially active flexible ring polymers with different knot topologies. Simple, unknotted active rings display a collapse transition upon increasing the degree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the polymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing earlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this difference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly and that of twist knots shrinks, eventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is a consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched active state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which increases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered configurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions, leading to collapse. These results yield a degree of control on the collapse point of active ring polymers, as it can be tuned by changing the topology.</description>

      <title>Learning the bulk and interfacial physics of liquid-liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.</description>

      <title>Emergent Softening and Stiffening Dictate Transport of Active Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filaments are crucial in various biophysical processes, yet insights into their single-filament behavior have predominantly relied on theory and simulations, owing to the scarcity of controllable synthetic systems. Here, we present an experimental platform of active semiflexible filaments composed of dielectric colloidal particles, activated by an alternating electric field that induces contractile or extensile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows. Our experiments reveal that contractile flow generating filaments undergo softening, significantly expanding the range of accessible conformations, whereas filaments composed of extensile flow monomers exhibit active stiffening. By independently tuning filament elasticity and activity, we demonstrate that the competition between elastic restoring forces and emergent hydrodynamic interactions along the filament governs conformational dynamics. Crucially, we discover that the timescale of conformational dynamics directly governs transport behavior: enhanced fluctuations promote diffusion while stiffening facilitates directed propulsion of nonlinear filaments. Together, our direct visualization studies elucidate the links between inherent filament properties, microscopic activity, and emergent transport while establishing a versatile experimental platform of synthetic filamentous active matter.</description>

      <title>Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Interplay of polar order and positional order in liquid crystals -- observation of re-entrant ferroelectric nematic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that development of polar order may spontaneously destroy the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal. This results in an unusual sequence of phases with the ferroelectric nematic phase appearing below a non-polar smectic phase. The effect is related to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers and can be explained by Landau theory in which the temperature dependent term is non-monotonic as it is renormalized by spontaneous electric polarization.</description>

      <title>Singular density correlations in chiral active fluids in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations in three-dimensional chiral active fluids by using a simple particle model of helical self-propelled particles. Each particle is driven by a self-propelled force and a constant uniaxial chiral torque, whose direction is identical for all particles. Due to the helical nature of the particle motion, the system is generically anisotropic even when it is spatially homogeneous. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the helicity induces an anisotropic pattern and a singularity in the static structure factor (the density correlation function in Fourier space) in the low-wavenumber limit. Moreover, the system in the limit of infinite persistence time exhibits hyperuniformity in the direction perpendicular to the chiral torque, while giant density fluctuations emerge along the parallel direction. We then construct a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for the system to describe the singular behavior. A linear analysis of the resulting equations yields an analytical expression for the static structure factor, which qualitatively agrees with our numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Noise-Enabled Goal Attainment in Crowded Collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate. We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a well-studied nonequilibrium collective phenomenon observed in active particles. Recently, there has been growing interest in how coupling the self-propulsion of active particles to chemical degrees of freedom affects MIPS. Although the effects of chemotaxis on MIPS have been extensively studied, little is known about how chemokinesis affects MIPS. In this study, we demonstrate that various patterns can be induced when active particles consume chemicals and exhibit chemokinesis, where higher chemical concentrations enhance self-propulsion without causing alignment with the chemical gradient. We discover that MIPS is intensified if chemical consumption is proportional to particle density (as in the basal metabolic regime), but it is suppressed if chemical consumption is closely tied to particle motion (as in the active metabolic regime). While the former produces large-scale phase separation via coarsening, the latter suppresses the coarsening process, leading to microphase separation and oscillating patterns. We also derive a hydrodynamic theory that describes these findings.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviors using transition-based allosteric self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allosteric interactions occur when binding at one part of a complex affects the interactions at another part. Allostery offers a high degree of control in multi-species processes, and these interactions play a crucial role in many biological and synthetic contexts. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure, or replicate. In this work we establish a basic allosteric model and develop an intuitive design process, which we demonstrate by constructing systems to exhibit four different complex behaviors: controlled fiber growth, shape-shifting, sorting, and self-replication. In order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed, we also calculate and measure key length and time scales. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviors, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</description>

Abstract: Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow dynamics below their melting temperatures, maintaining an amorphous structure reminiscent of normal liquids. Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the self-attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. Exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN+self-attention using physically-defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic bend instability of motile particles on a substrate</title>

Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <title>Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell &gt; r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell&gt;r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>
