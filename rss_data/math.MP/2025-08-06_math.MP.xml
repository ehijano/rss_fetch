      <title>Solving Differential Equations by Differentiating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we illustrate and explore the use of Taylor series as solutions of differential equations. For a large a number of classes of differential equations in the literature, there are plenty of sources where the well known Taylor Series Method is used to approximate the solution, but here we are focused in seeing the Taylor series as a solution, which in turn prompt us to find the recursions defining the coefficients in the series. Because these recursions are found by differentiating, instead of integrating the differential equation, it is not difficult to prove that the resulting series is a solution. In the case where the series does not have a closed analytic form or it is not a known function, Cauchy-Hadamard theorems can be used to find the radius of convergence and then the series is a solution for the differential equation, in the domain where it converges.</description>

      <title>Integrable multispecies totally asymmetric stochastic interacting particle systems with homogeneous rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.</description>

      <title>The problem of sharp notch in microstructured solids governed by dipolar gradient elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the asymptotic problem of a body of infinite extent with a notch (re-entrant corner) under remotely applied plane-strain or anti-plane shear loadings. The problem is formulated within the framework of the Toupin-Mindlin theory of dipolar gradient elasticity. This generalized continuum theory is appropriate to model the response of materials with microstructure. A linear version of the theory results by considering a linear isotropic expression for the strain-energy density that depends on strain-gradient terms, in addition to the standard strain terms appearing in classical elasticity. Through this formulation, a microstructural material length is introduced, in addition to the standard Lam\'e constants . The faces of the notch are considered to be traction-free and a boundary-layer approach is followed. The boundary value problem is attacked with the asymptotic Knein-Williams technique. Our analysis leads to an eigenvalue problem, which, along with the restriction of a bounded strain energy, provides the asymptotic fields. The cases of a crack and a half-space are analyzed in detail as limit cases of the general notch (infinite wedge) problem. The results show significant departure from the predictions of the standard fracture mechanics.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to coherent states of billiards using a quantum algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum billiards are a key focus in quantum mechanics, offering a simple yet powerful model to study complex quantum features. While the development of algebras for quantum systems is traced from one-dimensional integrable models to quantum groups and the Generalized Heisenberg Algebra (GHA). The primary focus of this work is to extend the GHA to quantum billiards, showcasing its application to separable and non-separable billiards. We apply the formalism to a square billiard, first generating one-dimensional coherent states with specific quantum numbers and exploring their time evolution.Then, we extend this approach to develop two-dimensional coherent states for the square billiards. We also demonstrate its applicability in a non-separable equilateral triangle billiard, describing their algebra generators and associated one-dimensional coherent states.</description>

      <title>Relativistic L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we investigate how to correctly describe sums of independent and identically distributed random velocities in the theory of special relativity. We derive a one-dimensional probability distribution of velocities stable under relativistic velocity addition. In a given system, this allows identifying distinct physical regimes in terms of the distribution's concavity at the origin and the probability of measuring relativistic velocities. These features provide a protocol to assess the relevance of stochastic relativistic effects in actual experiments. As examples, we find agreement with previous results about heavy-ion diffusion and show that our findings are consistent with the distribution of momentum deviations observed in measurements of antiproton cooling.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits a gradual period-doubling route to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Wild wall-crossing and symmetric quivers in 4d and 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09972v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulae for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theories and corresponding BPS quivers, including those of wild type, as identities for generating series of symmetric quivers that represent dualities of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ boundary theories. We identify such symmetric quivers for both sides of the wall-crossing formulae. In the finite chamber such a quiver is captured by the symmetrized BPS quiver, whereas on the other side of the wall we find an infinite quiver with an intricate pattern of arrows and loops. Invoking diagonalization, for $m$-Kronecker quivers we find a wall-crossing type formula involving trees of unlinkings that expresses closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the corresponding 4d theories in terms of open Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the 3d theories and invariants of $m$-loop quivers. Using this formula, we determine a number of closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of wild type.</description>

      <title>Full Vectorial Maxwell Equations with Continuous Angular Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical framework for solving Maxwell's equations in cylindrical and spherical geometries with continuous angular indices. We extend beyond standard discrete harmonic decomposition to a continuous spectral representation using generalized spectral integrals, capturing electromagnetic solutions that exhibit singular behavoiur yet yield finite-energy fields at the geometric center. For continuous angular indices $\ell, m \in \mathbb{R}$, we study existence and uniqueness of solutions in weighted Sobolev spaces $H^s_{\alpha(\ell,m)}(\Omega)$ following the framework established in ~\cite{adams2003, reed1975}, prove finite energy for $\ell &gt; -\frac{1}{2}$, and construct explicit spectral kernels via biorthogonal function systems. The framework encompasses both separable cylindrical modes with continuous azimuthal index $\nu \in (0,1)$ and non-separable spherical modes where field components couple through vectorial curl operations. We present asymptotic analysis of singular field behavior, investigate convergence rates for spectral approximations, and validate the theoretical framework through Galerkin projection methods and numerical spectral integration.</description>

      <title>When surface evolution meets Fokker-Planck equation: a novel tangential velocity model for uniform parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common issue in simulating geometric evolution of surfaces is unexpected clustering of points that may cause numerical instability. We propose a novel artificial tangential velocity method for this matter. The artificial tangential velocity is generated from a surface density field governed by a Fokker-Planck equation to guide the point distribution. A target distribution matching algorithm is developed leveraging the surface Kullback-Leibler divergence of density functions. The numerical method is formulated within a fully meshless framework using the moving least squares approximation, thereby eliminating the need for mesh generation and allowing flexible treatment of unstructured point cloud data. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed approach across a variety of surface evolution problems, including the mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotion, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>On the Pure States of the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of Pure State of the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz in finite and infinite spin systems without averaging on the disorder, nor using replicas. Consider a system of n spins $\sigma\in\Omega^{n}$ with the usual set $\Omega=\left\{ -1,1\right\}$ of inner states and let $G:\,\Omega^{n}\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ a Gibbs measure on it of Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ (also non random). We interpret the pure states of a model $\left(\Omega^{n},\mu\right)$ as disjoint subsets $\Omega^{n}$ such that the conditional measures behaves like product measures as in usual mean field approximations. Starting from such definition we try to reinterpret the RSB scheme and define an approximated probability measure. We then apply our results to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to obtain the Parisi formula.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Separation of Variables for the Extended Clebsch and Manakov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, using a modification of the method of vector fields $Z_i$ of the bi-Hamiltonian theory of separation of variables (SoV), we construct symmetric non-St\"ackel variable separation for three-dimensional extension of the Clebsch model, which is equivalent (in the bi-Hamiltonian sense) to the system of interacting Manakov (Schottky-Frahm) and Euler tops. For the obtained symmetric SoV (contrary to the previously constructed asymmetric one), all curves of separation are the same and have genus five. It occurred that the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases is encoded in the different form of the vector fields $Z$ used to construct separating polynomial. We explicitly construct coordinates and momenta of separation and Abel-type equations in the considered examples of symmetric SoV for the extended Clebsch and Manakov models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at a past timelike boundary point of spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha \geq 1$ or $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We employ the spacetime inextensibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce its inextensibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one nonzero critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along a $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic is equal to the Minkowski value.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional analogues of the Blasius-Chaplygin formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Blasius--Chaplygin formula provides an elegant method for calculating the lift force on a two-dimensional body in steady, irrotational flow. The key ingredient is the definition of a complex-valued potential function \begin{equation*} f(z) = \varphi(x, y) + \mathbf{i}\psi(x, y), \end{equation*} which can then be integrated using Cauchy's theorem along any closed contour surrounding the body. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional extension of the classical Blasius--Chaplygin formula using quaternionic analysis. After presenting the basics of quaternionic analysis, we discuss how \emph{monogenic functions} -- the quaternionic analog of classical holomorphic functions -- can be used to describe problems in fluid dynamics. Finally, we present the Blasius--Chaplygin formula in quaternionic form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework for nonlocal Lagrangian systems without relying on infinite-derivative expansions. Starting from a (trajectory-based) variational principle and a generalized Noether theorem, we define the canonical momenta and energy. Moreover, we construct a (pre)symplectic form on the kinematic space, and show that its restriction to the phase space (by implementing the constraints) yields a true (pre)symplectic structure encoding the dynamics. Three examples -- a finite nonlocal oscillator, the fully nonlocal Pais-Uhlenbeck model, and a delayed harmonic oscillator -- demonstrate how phase space and the Hamiltonian emerge without explicitly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Bulk Universality for Sparse Complex non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk for complex random matrices with independent entries whose $r$-th absolute moment decays as $N^{-1-(r-2)\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$ are universal. This includes sparse matrices whose entries are the product of a Bernouilli random variable with mean $N^{-1+\epsilon}$ and an independent complex-valued random variable. By a standard truncation argument, we can also conclude universality for complex random matrices with $4+\epsilon$ moments. The main ingredient is a sparse multi-resolvent local law for products involving any finite number of resolvents of the Hermitisation and deterministic $2N\times2N$ matrices whose $N\times N$ blocks are multiples of the identity.</description>

      <title>A class of 2x2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.</description>

      <title>Planar UST Branches and $c=-2$ Degenerate Boundary Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a conformal field theory (CFT) description of the probabilistic model of boundary effects in the wired uniform spanning tree (UST) and its algebraic content, concerning the entire first row of the Kac table with central charge $c=-2$. Namely, we prove that all boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities for (potentially fused) branches in the wired UST converge in the scaling limit to explicit CFT quantities, expressed in terms of determinants, which can also be viewed as conformal blocks of degenerate primary fields in a boundary CFT with central charge $c=-2$.
  Moreover, we verify that the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) PDEs (i.e., Virasoro degeneracies) of arbitrary orders hold, and we also reveal an underlying valenced Temperley-Lieb algebra action on the space of boundary correlation functions of primary fields in this model. To prove these results, we combine probabilistic techniques with representation theory.</description>

      <title>A von Neumann algebraic approach to Quantum Theory on curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending the method developed in our recent paper \cite{LM} we present the AQFT framework in terms of von Neumann algebras. In particular, this approach allows for a locally covariant categorical description of AQFT which moreover satisfies the additivity property and provides a natural and intrinsic framework for a description of entanglement. Turning to dynamical aspects of QFT we show that Killing local flows may be lifted to the algebraic setting in curved space-time. Furthermore, conditions under which quantum Lie derivatives of such local flows exist are provided. The central question that then emerges is how such quantum local flows might be described in interesting representations. We show that quasi-free representations of Weyl algebras fit the presented framework perfectly. Finally, the problem of enlarging the set of observables is discussed. We point out the usefulness of Orlicz space techniques to encompass unbounded field operators. In particular, a well-defined framework within which one can manipulate such operators is necessary for the correct presentation of (semiclassical) Einstein's equation.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism is used to derive an integro-differential equation for observables in a Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. However, the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem for the orthogonal dynamics remains an open problem. Moreover, it is rarely discussed under which assumptions the Dyson identity, which is used to derive the GLE, holds. In this article, we address this issue for rank-one projections (Mori's projection).
  For the Mori projection, the orthogonal dynamics is obtained from the bounded perturbation theorem. The variation of constants formula for strongly continuous semigroups then yields the GLE and the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT). We show that the variation of constants can be replaced by a limiting process in order to give a general proof of the GLE and 2FDT that does not require the differentiability of the fluctuating forces.
  In addition, we offer an alternative approach that does not require the bounded perturbation theorem. Our starting point is the observation that the GLE and 2FDT uniquely determine the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. Furthermore, the orbit maps for the orthogonal dynamics can be directly defined via solutions of linear Volterra equations. All desired properties of the orthogonal dynamics are then proven directly from this definition. In particular, the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}\mathcal{Q}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator.
  Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup.</description>

      <title>A study of path measures based on second-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic investigation of the mathematical structure of path measures and their profound connections to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) through the framework of second-order Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations. This approach establishes a unified methodology for analyzing large deviation principles (LDPs), entropy minimization, entropy production, and inverse learning problems in stochastic systems. The second-order HJ equations are shown to play a central role in bridging stochastic dynamics and measure theory while forming the foundation of stochastic geometric mechanics and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics.
  The large deviation rate function is rigorously derived from the probabilistic structure of path measures and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Onsager--Machlup functional of stochastic gradient systems coupled with second-order HJ equations. We revisit entropy minimization problems, including finite time horizon problems and Schr\"{o}dinger's problem, demonstrating the connections with stochastic geometric mechanics. In the context of stochastic thermodynamics, we present a novel decomposition of entropy production, revealing that thermodynamic irreversibility can be interpreted as the difference of the corresponding forward and backward second-order HJ equations. Furthermore, we tackle the challenging problem of identifying stochastic gradient systems from observed most probable paths by reformulating the original nonlinear and non-convex problem into a linear and convex framework through a second-order HJ equation. Together, this work establishes a comprehensive mathematical study of the relations between path measures and stochastic dynamical systems, and their diverse applications in stochastic thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Einstein Type Systems on Complete Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the coupled Einstein Constraint Equations (ECE) on complete manifolds through the conformal method, focusing on non-compact manifolds with flexible asymptotics. In particular, we do not impose any specific model for infinity being motivated to account for initial data sets of bounded geometry, which we take to be physically well motivated by standard cosmological space-times with non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces. First, we prove an existence criteria on compact manifolds with boundary which applies to more general systems and can be seen as a natural extension of known existence theory for the coupled ECE. Building on this, we prove an existence criterium on complete manifolds with appropriate barrier functions for a family of physically well-motivated coupled systems on complete manifolds. Finally, we build barrier functions and thus show existence in the bounded geometry case.</description>

      <title>Orbifold completion of 3-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of 3-dimensional ``orbifold completion'', to describe (generalised) orbifolds of topological quantum field theories as well as all their defects. Given a semistrict 3-category $\mathcal{T}$ with adjoints for all 1- and 2-morphisms (more precisely, a Gray category with duals), we construct the 3-category $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ as a Morita category of certain $E_1$-algebras in $\mathcal{T}$ which encode triangulation invariance. We prove that in $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ again all 1- and 2-morphisms have adjoints, that it contains $\mathcal{T}$ as a full subcategory, and we argue, but do not prove, that it satisfies a universal property which implies $(\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}})_{\textrm{orb}} \cong \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$. This is a categorification of the work in [CR]. Orbifold completion by design allows us to lift the orbifold construction from closed TQFT to the much richer world of defect TQFTs. We illustrate this by constructing a universal 3-dimensional state sum model with all defects from first principles, and we explain how recent work on defects between Witt equivalent Reshetikhin--Turaev theories naturally appears as a special case of orbifold completion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a graphical calculus for the microformal or thick morphisms introduced by Ted Voronov. This allows us to write the infinite series arising from pullbacks, compositions, and coordinate transformations of thick morphisms as sums over bipartite trees. The methods are inspired by those employed by Cattaneo-Dherin-Felder in their work on formal symplectic groupoids. We also extend this calculus to quantum thick morphisms, which are special types of Fourier integral operators quantizing classical thick morphisms. The relationship between the calculi for classical and quantum thick morphisms resembles the relationship between the semi-classical and full perturbative expansions over Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the heat equation with Grushin's operator. We present an expression for its heat kernel, prove its decay in $L^p$ spaces, and that it is an approximation of the identity. As a consequence, the heat semigroup associated with Grushin's operator using this heat kernel is estimated in Lebesgue spaces. Next, we use the results to prove the existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence, and blowup alternative of mild solutions of a nonlinear Cauchy problem associated with Grushin's operator. A global existence result is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a large class of deformations of continuous and discrete biorthogonal ensembles and investigate their behavior in the limit of a large number of particles. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that if a biorthogonal ensemble converges to a (universal) limiting process, then the deformed biorthogonal ensemble converges to a deformed version of the same limiting process. To construct the deformed version of the limiting process, we rely on a procedure of marking and conditioning. Our approach is based on an analysis of the probability generating functionals of the ensembles and is conceptually different from the traditional approach via correlation kernels. Thanks to this method, our sufficient conditions are rather mild and do not rely on much regularity of the original ensemble and of the deformation. As a consequence of our results, we obtain probabilistic interpretations of several Painlev\'e-type kernels that have been constructed in the literature, as deformations of classical sine and Airy point processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. {The 7-sphere, $\bS^7$, was the first topological manifold where the possibility of inequivalent differential structures was discovered \cite{Milnor}.} In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on $\bS^7$. { $\bS^7$ is a fibre bundle of the 3-sphere as a fibre on the 4-sphere as a base. We consider the Kaluza-Klein limit of such a fibre bundle which reduces to a SO(4) Yang-Mills gauge theory over $\bS^4$. We find, for certain specific symmetric set of gauge potentials, that the spectrum of the Dirac operator can be computed explicitly, for each choice of the differential structure. Hence identical topological manifolds have different physical laws. We find this the most important conclusion of our analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD), which couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$, are known to support solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four HMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, which retains finite electron inertia, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations on Dimer Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <title>RNS superstring measure for genus 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the RNS supersting measure for genus 3. Our derivation is based on invariant theory. We follow Witten's idea of using an algebraic parametrization of the moduli space (which he applied to re-derive D'Hoker and Phong's formula for the RNS superstring measure for genus 2); but the particular parametrization that we use has not been applied to superstring theory before. We prove that the superstring measure is a linear combinaition (with complex coefficients) of three known functions. Furthermore, we conjecture the values of the coefficients of this linear combination and provide evidence for this conjecture. Unlike the Ansatz of Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza and van Geemen from 2008, our formula has a polar singularity along the hyperelliptic locus; the existence of this singularity was established by Witten in 2015. Moreover, our formula is not an Ansatz but follows from first principles, except for the values of the three coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenenergies $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n$-th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions compactified on the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, starting from the mirror pair of Batyrev lattices corresponding to a given CY manifold, we construct vertex operators of the complete physical theory as cohomology of Borisov differentials that correspond to points of reflexive Batyrev polyhedra. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01932v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how factorisation with respect to nonlocal pseudosymmetries allows one to obtain B\"acklund transformations, interpreted as nonlocal $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms of differential equations. According to this approach, which is illustrated through several examples, the B\"acklund transformations are determined by basic invariants of the exploited nonlocal pseudosymmetries.</description>

      <title>$x-y$ swap for $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel-Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini-Gibney-Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology of genus zero surfaces a ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>

      <title>The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad generation theorem,and a generalization to non-stationary evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The (separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is given.The condition for CP evolution is just that for semigroups applied at each instant, and the Lindblad decomposition can be chosen continuous in time.</description>

Abstract: We provide quantitative improvements to the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and the Kr\"oger inequality, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

      <title>Spacetime inextensibility criteria by volume-distance-ratio asymptote and applications to naked singularities and FLRW spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i) $C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim |t|$. The key estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with the scale factor $|t|$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>A More Convex Ising Formulation of Max-3-Cut Using Higher-Order Spin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.</description>

      <title>Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.</description>
