      <title>Study on quantum thermalization from thermal initial states in a superconducting quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization in contemporary quantum devices, in particular quantum computers, has recently attracted significant theoretical interest. Unusual thermalization processes, such as the Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME), have been explored theoretically. However, there is a shortage of experimental results due to the difficulty in preparing thermal states. In this paper, we propose a method to address this challenge. Moreover, we experimentally validate our approach using IBM quantum devices, providing results for unusal relaxation in equidistant quenches as predicted for the IBM qubit. We also assess the formalism introduced for the QME, obtaining results consistent with the theoretical predictions. This demonstration underscores that our method can streamline the investigation of thermal states and thermalization in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Performing Non-Local Phase Estimation with a Rydberg-Superconducting Qubit Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation is the key to high volume computation in the NISQ era. This investigation explores the key aspects necessary for the construction of a quantum network by numerically simulating the execution of the distributed phase estimation algorithm in a proposed novel superconducting-resonator-atom hybrid system. The phase estimation algorithm is used to estimate the phase or eigenvalue of a given unitary operator and is a sub-process of many other known quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm and the quantum counting algorithm . An entangling gate between two qubits is utilised in the distributed phase estimation algorithm, called an E2 gate which provides the possibility to transfer quantum information from one quantum computer to another, which was numerically shown to have a construction time of 17ns at a fidelity of 93%. This investigation analytically derives the Hamiltonian dynamics as well as the noise sources of each system and utilizes quantum optimal control (QOC), namely the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, to minimize fidelity error in the corresponding systems gate construction. The GRAPE algorithm showed very accurate engineering of Rydberg atom single and multi-qubit gates with fidelities higher than 90% while the flux qubit suffered greatly from noise with multi-qubit gate fidelities lower than 90%. The C-shunt factor was shown to decrease the noise of the flux qubit which in turn increased the probability of accurately estimating the phase using 4 counting qubits. A trade off was observed between the number of time steps in the descent/ascent and the number of GRAPE iterations ran on the optimisation for low C-shunt factors $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1000$. For $\zeta = 1000$, the GRAPE algorithm showed effectiveness for a large number of time steps and large amount of GRAPE iterations by reaching estimation accuracies greater than 90%.</description>

      <title>Quantum Subroutine for Variance Estimation: Algorithmic Design and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing sets the foundation for new ways of designing algorithms, thanks to the peculiar properties inherited by quantum mechanics. The exploration of this new paradigm faces new challenges concerning which field quantum speedup can be achieved. Towards finding solutions, looking for the design of quantum subroutines that are more efficient than their classical counterpart poses solid pillars to new powerful quantum algorithms. Herewith, we delve into a grounding subroutine, the computation of the variance, whose usefulness spaces across different fields of application, particularly the Artificial Intelligence (AI) one. Indeed, the finding of the quantum counterpart of these building blocks impacts vertically those algorithms that leverage this metric. In this work, we propose QVAR, a quantum subroutine, to compute the variance that exhibits a logarithmic complexity both in the circuit depth and width, excluding the state preparation cost. With the vision of showing the use of QVAR as a subroutine for new quantum algorithms, we tackle two tasks from the AI domain: Feature Selection and Outlier Detection. In particular, we showcase two AI hybrid quantum algorithms that leverage QVAR: the Hybrid Quantum Feature Selection (HQFS) algorithm and the Quantum Outlier Detection Algorithm (QODA). In this manuscript, we describe the implementation of QVAR, HQFS, and QODA, providing their correctness and complexities and showing the effectiveness of these hybrid quantum algorithms with respect to their classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Quantum Simulators Of Gauge Theories Against $1/f$ Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the application of quantum simulation in the ongoing "second" quantum revolution, which employs various synthetic quantum matter platforms, such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting qubits, to realize exotic condensed matter and particle physics phenomena with high precision and control. Gauge theories are of particular interest in modern quantum simulators as they offer a new probe of high-energy physics on low-energy tabletop devices. However, to accurately model gauge-theory phenomena on a quantum simulator, stabilizing the underlying gauge symmetry is crucial. Through this thesis we demonstrate that a recently developed experimentally feasible scheme based on linear gauge protection, initially devised to protect against coherent gauge breaking errors, can also be used to suppress incoherent errors arising from $1/f^{\beta}$ noise prominent in various quantum simulation platforms. The Bloch-Redfield formalism is introduced to model gauge violations arising due to these incoherent errors given the noise power spectrum of the environment. The efficacy of linear gauge protection in stabilizing salient features of gauge theories in quantum simulators, such as gauge invariance and exotic far from equilibrium phenomenon focusing on disorder-free localization, and quantum many-body scars against $1/f^{\beta}$ noise sources, is illustrated. These results are immediately applicable in modern analog quantum simulators and digital NISQ devices, paving the way for further development in the field of quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>QubiCSV: An Open-Source Data Storage and Visualization Platform for Collaborative Qubit Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce QubiCSV (Qubit Control Storage and Visualization), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.</description>

      <title>Using quantum computers to identify prime numbers via entanglement dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of prime numbers stands as a fundamental mathematical pursuit with significant historical and contemporary significance. Exploring potential connections between prime number theory and quantum physics represents a compelling frontier in scientific inquiry. In a recent study by A. L. M. Southier et al. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 042404 (2023)], the entanglement dynamics of two harmonic oscillators (or of two spin $s$ particles) initially prepared in a separable-coherent state was demonstrated to offer a pathway for prime number identification. Building upon this foundation, this Letter presents a generalized approach and outlines a deterministic algorithm for realizing this theoretical concept on qubit-based quantum computers. Our analysis reveals that the diagonal unitary operations employed in our algorithm exhibit a polynomial time complexity of degree two, contrasting with the previously reported exponential complexity of general diagonal unitaries [J. Welch et al., New J. Phys. 16, 033040 (2014)]. This advancement underscores the potential of quantum computing for prime number identification and related computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a polynomial time classical algorithm has been found for learning the shallow representation of a unitary $U$ acting on $n$-qubits, by learning local inversions and then sewing them back together with ancilla qubits and SWAP gates. In this work, we bootstrap local inversion learning (LIL) to optimize quantum circuit depth by learning shallow representations for its sub-unitaries. We recursively cut circuits and apply the LIL algorithm to replace sub-circuits with their shallow representations, if it can be found by the algorithm. If not, we keep cutting until the optimization terminates, either by finding shallow representations or by reaching constant-depth sub-circuits. By replacing sub-circuits with their shallow representations, we hope to obtain some compression of the quantum circuit. Due to the binary search structure, the optimization algorithm has time complexity logarithmic in the depth of the original given circuit.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Learning with SASQuaTCh: a Novel Variational Quantum Transformer Architecture with Kernel-Based Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely popular transformer network popularized by the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has a large field of applicability, including predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to the dynamics of physical systems. In the latter context, the continuous analog of the self-attention mechanism at the heart of transformer networks has been applied to learning the solutions of partial differential equations and reveals a convolution kernel nature that can be exploited by the Fourier transform. It is well known that many quantum algorithms that have provably demonstrated a speedup over classical algorithms utilize the quantum Fourier transform. In this work, we explore quantum circuits that can efficiently express a self-attention mechanism through the perspective of kernel-based operator learning. In this perspective, we are able to represent deep layers of a vision transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms. We analyze the computational and parameter complexity of our novel variational quantum circuit, which we call Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), and demonstrate its utility on simplified classification problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spin Helix States as Quantum Many-Body Scars in Partially Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of non-Hermitian projectors.</description>

      <title>Noisy atomic magnetometry with Kalman filtering and measurement-based feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking a magnetic field in real-time with an atomic magnetometer presents significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters. These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed, the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate for large ensembles that the EKF not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in large open quantum systems: the case of transmon readout and reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework that combines the adjoint state method together with reverse-time back-propagation to solve otherwise prohibitively large open-system quantum control problems. Our approach enables the optimization of arbitrary cost functions with fully general controls applied on large open quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equation. It is scalable, computationally efficient, and has a low memory footprint. We apply this framework to optimize two inherently dissipative operations in superconducting qubits which lag behind in terms of fidelity and duration compared to other unitary operations: the dispersive readout and all-microwave reset of a transmon qubit. Our results show that, given a fixed set of system parameters, shaping the control pulses can yield 2x improvements in the fidelity and duration for both of these operations compared to standard strategies. Our approach can readily be applied to optimize quantum controls in a vast range of applications such as reservoir engineering, autonomous quantum error correction, and leakage-reduction units.</description>

      <title>Joint-measurability and quantum communication with untrusted devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon loss represents a major challenge for the implementation of quantum communication protocols with untrusted devices, e.g. in the device-independent (DI) or semi-DI approaches. Determining critical loss thresholds is usually done in case-by-case studies. In the present work, we develop a general framework for characterizing the admissible levels of loss and noise in a wide range of scenarios and protocols with untrusted measurement devices. In particular, we present general bounds that apply to prepare-and-measure protocols for the semi-DI approach, as well as to Bell tests for DI protocols. A key step in our work is to establish a general connection between quantum protocols with untrusted measurement devices and the fundamental notions of channel extendibility and joint-measurability, which capture essential aspects of the communication and measurement of quantum information. In particular, this leads us to introduce the notion of partial joint-measurability, which naturally arises within quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this work, we systematically construct solvable non-integrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the effect of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem boundary. The realization of exact Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optical loss thresholds in the fusion-based quantum computing architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSM) play a significant role in quantum information and quantum computing, in particular, in fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC). The FBQC model is a framework for universal quantum computing provided that we are able to perform entangling measurements, called fusions, on qubits within small entangled resource states. Here we analyse the usage of different linear-optical BSM circuits as fusions in the FBQC schemes and numerically evaluate hardware requirements for fault-tolerance in this framework. We examine and compare the performance of several BSM circuits with varying additional resources and estimate the requirements on losses for every component of the linear-optical realization of fusions under which errors in fusion networks caused by these losses can be corrected. Our results show that fault-tolerant quantum computing in the FBQC model is possible with currently achievable levels of optical losses in an integrated photonic implementation, provided that we can create and detect single photons of the resource states with a total marginal efficiency higher than 0.973.</description>

Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Realisation of versatile and effective quantum metrology using a single bosonic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology offers superior measurement precision compared to classical counterparts. Traditionally, achieving this enhancement involves employing multi-particle entangled quantum states, necessitating state preparation and detection schemes that are practically challenging. In this article, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that leverages two state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase and amplitude estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low photon numbers of up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB and 9.3(5) dB respectively for phase and amplitude estimation. We show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states based on specific system constraints. Our protocol can be adapted to further optimize the desired figures of merit using tailored quantum states or operations, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable platforms. The realisation of this versatile and effective scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Image Classification with Rotation-Invariant Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with $C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory is traditionally formulated using complex numbers. This imaginarity of quantum theory has been quantified as a resource with applications in discrimination tasks, pseudorandomness generation, and quantum metrology. Here we propose witnesses for imaginarity that are basis-independent, relying on measurements of unitary-invariant properties of sets of states. For 3 pure states, we completely characterize the invariant values attainable by quantum theory, and give a partial characterization for 4 pure states. We show that simple pairwise overlap measurements suffice to witness imaginarity of sets of 4 states, but not for sets of 3. Our witnesses are experimentally friendly, opening up a new path for measuring and using imaginarity as a resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the inadequacy of mean-field theory by exploring the effects of initial state correlations on the dynamics of continuous time crystals, necessitating higher-order cumulant expansions. We exemplify this using cat states for which the mean field fails to predict a phase transition but the second order cumulant expansion theory captures it. Motivated by the symmetries of the system, we choose a truncation of cumulant theory at the second-order and demonstrate that it is sufficient to accurately capture the dynamical features overlooked by the mean-field.</description>

      <title>Rate-fidelity trade-off in cavity-based remote entanglement generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper, by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this case as well.</description>

      <title>Measuring two temperatures using a single thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question: Is it possible to measure two temperatures simultaneously using a single thermometer? Under common circumstances, where the thermometer can interact with only one bath at a time and the interaction leads to complete thermalization, this is clearly impossible because the final state of the thermometer would be independent of the temperature of the first bath. In this work, we show that this task can indeed be accomplished with the assistance of quantum control. In particular, we consider a composite particle with multiple quantum degrees of freedom (DoF) as a temperature sensor, where one of the DoF -- termed as internal DoF -- is susceptible to the local temperature, thereby functioning as a thermometer, whereas another DoF -- termed external DoF -- is quantum-controlled. We leverage the entanglement between the aforementioned DoF in a composite particle for two-temperature thermometry by preparing the external DoF in a quantum superposition, exposing the internal DoF to two local temperatures. We show that such a particle used in a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, or a quantum switch -- which allows quantum control over the order of application of quantum channels -- can be used to estimate two temperatures simultaneously, thus affirming our main proposition. For each of these setups, we obtain the variance in the estimated temperatures through the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound, and compare their performances based on the range of total variance of the two temperatures estimated. On benchmarking all the setups based on the total variance of the estimated temperatures, we find that a quantum switch with a qudit probe outperforms other setups. On restricting our probe to be a qubit, we find that quantum switch performs equally well as a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N lateral spectral-bands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can extract the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two lateral spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scattering matrix approach to dynamical Sauter-Schwinger process: Spin- and helicity-resolved momentum distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Sauter-Schwinger mechanism of electron-positron pair creation by a time-dependent electric field pulses is considered using the $S$-matrix approach and reduction formulas. They lead to the development of framework based on the solutions of the Dirac equation with the Feynman- or anti-Feynman boundary conditions. Their asymptotic properties are linked to the spin-resolved probability amplitudes of created pairs. The same concerns the helicity-resolved amplitudes. Most importantly, the aforementioned spin- or helicity-resolved amplitudes, when summed over spin or helicity configurations, reproduce the momentum distributions of created particles calculated with other methods that are typically used in this context. This does validate the current approach. It also allows us to investigate the vortex structures in momentum distributions of produced particles, as the method provides an access to the phase of the probability amplitude. As we also illustrate numerically, the method is applicable to arbitrary time-dependent electric fields with, in general, elliptical polarization. This proves its great flexibility.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative phase separation in free-space atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driven Dicke model, wherein an ensemble of atoms is driven by an external field and undergoes collective spontaneous emission due to coupling to a leaky cavity mode, is a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting a driven-dissipative phase transition as a function of driving strength. Recently, a similar phenomenon was experimentally observed, not in a cavity setting, but rather in a free-space atomic ensemble. The reason why similar behavior should emerge in free space is not obvious, as the system interacts with a continuum of optical modes, which encodes light propagation effects. Here, we present and solve a simple model to explain the behavior of the free-space system, based on the one-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch equations. On one hand, we show that a free-space ensemble at a low optical depth can exhibit similar behavior as the cavity system, as spatial propagation effects are negligible. On the other hand, in the thermodynamic limit of large atom number, we show that certain observables such as the transmittance or the atomic excited population exhibit non-analytic behavior as a function of the driving intensity, reminiscent of a phase transition. However, a closer analysis reveals that the atomic properties are highly inhomogeneous in space, and based on this we argue that the free-space system does not undergo a phase transition but rather a ``phase separation", roughly speaking, between saturated and unsaturated regions.</description>

Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy scattering is well described by the effective-range expansion. In quantum mechanics, a tower of contact interactions can generate terms in this expansion after renormalization. Scattering parameters are also encoded in the self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. We briefly review this well-known result for two particles with s-wave interactions using impenetrable self-adjoint extensions, including the case of harmonically trapped two-particle states. By contrast, the one-dimensional scattering problem is surprisingly intricate. We show that the families of self-adjoint extensions correspond to a coupled system of symmetric and antisymmetric outgoing waves, which is diagonalized by an SU(2) transformation that accounts for mixing and a relative phase. This is corroborated by an effective theory computation that includes all four energy-independent contact interactions. The equivalence of various one-dimensional contact interactions is discussed and scrutinized from the perspective of renormalization. As an application, the spectrum of a general point interaction with a harmonic trap is solved in one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the orbital degree of freedom in optically active semiconductor quantum dots emerged as a promising candidate. However, the crucial ability to perform arbitrary rotation on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate complete control of hole orbital states in a quantum dot. This is enabled by successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems connected via radiative Auger transitions. This new capability allows manipulations of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector, as evidenced by Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference, respectively. Simultaneous control of both parameters is achieved by concurrently varying the amplitude and phase of picosecond Raman pulses, enabling arbitrary unitary rotation of the Bloch vector. Our results establish the orbital states in solid-state quantum emitters as a potentially viable resource for applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helstrom measurement (HM) is known to be the optimal strategy for distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum error. Previously, a binary classifier based on classical simulation of the HM has been proposed. It was observed that using multiple copies of the sample data reduced the classification error. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in simulation runtime hindered a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the number of copies and classification performance. We present an efficient simulation method for an arbitrary number of copies by utilizing the relationship between HM and state fidelity. Our method reveals that the classification performance does not improve monotonically with the number of data copies. Instead, it needs to be treated as a hyperparameter subject to optimization, achievable only through the method proposed in this work. We present a Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning binary classifier with excellent performance, providing such empirical evidence by benchmarking on eight datasets and comparing it with 13 hyperparameter optimized standard classifiers.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we introduce a notion of local fraction for experiments taking place against arbitrary static causal backgrounds -- greatly generalising previous results on no-signalling scenarios -- and we explicitly formulate a linear program to compute this quantity. We derive a free characterisation of causal functions which allows us to efficiently construct the matrices required to perform concrete calculations. We demonstrate our techniques by analysing the local fraction of a novel example involving two Bell tests in interleaved causal order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe non-perturbative high harmonic generation in solids pumped by a macroscopic quantum state of light, bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from $0$ to $2 \times 10^{13}$ photons per pulse, and sub-cycle electric field fluctuations over $\pm1\hbox{V}/\hbox{\r{A}}$, BSV provides access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities than accessible with coherent light. It is also considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than coherent light of the same mean intensity.</description>

      <title>Linear cross-entropy certification of quantum computational advantage in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validation of quantum advantage claims in the context of Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) currently relies on providing evidence that the experimental samples genuinely follow their corresponding ground truth, i.e., the theoretical model of the experiment that includes all the possible losses that the experimenters can account for. This approach to verification has an important drawback: it is necessary to assume that the ground truth distributions are computationally hard to sample, that is, that they are sufficiently close to the distribution of the ideal, lossless experiment, for which there is evidence that sampling, either exactly or approximately, is a computationally hard task. This assumption, which cannot be easily confirmed, opens the door to classical algorithms that exploit the noise in the ground truth to efficiently simulate the experiments, thus undermining any quantum advantage claim. In this work, we argue that one can avoid this issue by validating GBS implementations using their corresponding ideal distributions directly. We explain how to use a modified version of the linear cross-entropy, a measure that we call the LXE score, to find reference values that help us assess how close a given GBS implementation is to its corresponding ideal model. Finally, we analytically compute the score that would be obtained by a lossless GBS implementation.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the rotating wave approximation for coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the validity of the rotating wave approximation of an ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators evolving with a quadratic Hamiltonian and arbitrarily strong interaction. We solve the dynamics analytically by employing tools from symplectic geometry. We focus on systems with initial Gaussian states and quantify exactly the deviation between the state obtained through the rotating approximation and the state obtained through the full evolution, therefore providing an answer for all values of the coupling. We find that the squeezing present in the full Hamiltonian and in the initial state governs the deviation from the approximated evolution. Furthermore, we also show that the rotating wave approximation is recovered for resonant frequencies and vanishing coupling to frequency ratio. Finally, we give a general proof of the rotating wave approximation and estimate its convergence on Fock states. Applications and potential physical implementations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Imaging of Electronic Hot Spots Using Quantum Squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting electronic hot spots is important for understanding the heat dissipation and thermal management of electronic and semiconductor devices. Optical thermoreflective imaging is being used to perform precise temporal and spatial imaging of heat on wires and semiconductor materials. We apply quantum squeezed light to perform thermoreflective imaging on micro-wires, surpassing the shot-noise limit of classical approaches. We obtain a far-field temperature sensing accuracy of 42 mK after 50 ms of averaging and show that a $256\times256$ pixel image can be constructed with such sensitivity in 10 minutes. We can further obtain single-shot temperature sensing of 1.6 K after only 10 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ of averaging enabling dynamical study of heat dissipation. Not only do the quantum images provide accurate spatio-temporal information about heat distribution, but the measure of quantum correlation provides additional information, inaccessible by classical techniques, that can lead to a better understanding of the dynamics. We apply the technique to both Al and Nb microwires and discuss the applications of the technique in studying electron dynamics at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the transition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF) or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study prevails that, similar to the contact interactions, the MIT can be influenced by competing intra and inter-component density induced tunnelings and off-site interactions. To probe the MIT in the strongly interacting regime, we study the extended version of the Bose-Hubbard model with the density induced tunneling and nearest-neighbouring interaction terms, and focus in the regime where the hopping processes are considerably weaker than the on-site interaction. We solve this model through site-decoupling mean-field theory with Gutzwiller ansatz and characterize the miscibility through the site-wise co-existence of the two-component across the lattice. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.</description>

      <title>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$ can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_c$, we reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$. In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point $\omega_c$. Finally, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Calculations of magnetic field produced by spin-vortex-induced loop currents in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ thin films using the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called, `` spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. We calculate magnetic fields produced by them for a model of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin films composed of one surface and two bulk CuO$_2$ bilayers. In this model, bulk CuO$_2$ layers host stable spin-vortices around small polarons formed from doped holes; they give rise to a $U(1)$ gauge field described by the Berry connection from many-body wave functions, and generates the SVILCs. The effect of the gauge field is taken into account by the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (PNC-BdG) formalism. The magnitude of the calculated magnetic field produced by the SVILCs in the vicinity of the surface ($10a \approx 4$ nm, where $a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) is in the order of mT; thus, may be detectable by currently available detection methods. The detection of the SVILCs by the magnetic field measurement may bring about the elucidation of the cuprate superconductivity, and may also lead to their quantum device applications, including qubits.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schr\"odinger cat qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations Suppress the Critical Fields in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$) interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields. Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the possibility of a quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding system-bath correlations in open quantum systems is essential for various quantum information and technology applications. Derivations of most master equations (MEs) for the dynamics of open systems require approximations that mask dependence of the system dynamics on correlations, since the MEs focus on reduced system dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the most common MEs indeed contain hidden information about explicit system-environment correlation. We unfold these correlations by recasting the MEs into a universal form in which the system-bath correlation operator appears. The equations include the Lindblad, Redfield, second-order time-convolutionless, second-order Nakajima-Zwanzig, and second-order universal Lindblad-like cases. We further illustrate our results in an example, which implies that the second-order universal Lindblad-like equation captures correlation more accurately than other standard techniques.</description>

Abstract: The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.</description>

Abstract: Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al, NJP 10,7,073013 (2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension [Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and explore its relations with the known generalisations.</description>

Abstract: Using quantum systems with more than two levels, or qudits, can scale the computation space of quantum processors more efficiently than using qubits, which may offer an easier physical implementation for larger Hilbert spaces. However, individual qudits may exhibit larger noise, and algorithms designed for qubits require to be recompiled to qudit algorithms for execution. In this work, we implemented a two-qubit emulator using a 4-level superconducting transmon qudit for variational quantum algorithm applications and analyzed its noise model. The major source of error for the variational algorithm was readout misclassification error and amplitude damping. To improve the accuracy of the results, we applied error-mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of the misclassification and qudit decay event. The final predicted energy value is within the range of chemical accuracy. Our work demonstrates that qudits are a practical alternative to qubits for variational algorithms.</description>

Abstract: A levitated nanomechanical oscillator under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) is highly isolated from its environment. It has been predicted that this isolation leads to very low mechanical dissipation rates. However, a gap persists between predictions and experimental data. Here, we levitate a silica nanoparticle in a linear Paul trap at room temperature, at pressures as low as $7\times10^{-11}$ mbar. We measure a dissipation rate of $2\pi\times69(22)$ nHz, corresponding to a quality factor exceeding $10^{10}$, more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously shown. A study of the pressure dependence of the particle's damping and heating rates provides insight into the relevant dissipation mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Transferring quantum information between different types of quantum hardware is crucial for integrated quantum technology. In particular, converting information between continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) devices enables many applications in quantum networking, quantum sensing, quantum machine learning, and quantum computing. This paper addresses the transfer of CV-encoded information between CV and DV devices. We present a resource-efficient method for encoding CV states and implementing CV gates on DV devices, as well as two measurement-based protocols for transferring CV states between CV and DV devices. The success probability of the transfer protocols depends on the measurement outcome and can be increased to near-deterministic values by adding ancillary qubits to the DV devices.</description>

      <title>Estimating properties of a quantum state by importance-sampled operator shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring properties of quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics. We provide a simple method for estimating the expectation value of observables with an unknown quantum state. The idea is to use a data structure to sample the terms of observables based on the Pauli decomposition proportionally to their importance. We call this technique operator shadow as a shorthand for the procedure of preparing a sketch of an operator to estimate properties. Only when the numbers of observables are small for multiple local observables, the sample complexity of this method is better than the classical shadow technique. However, if we want to estimate the expectation value of a linear combination of local observables, for example the energy of a local Hamiltonian, the sample complexity is better on all parameters. The time complexity to construct the data structure is $2^{O(k)}$ for $k$-local observables, similar to the post-processing time of classical shadows.</description>

Abstract: Quantum transducers convert quantum signals through hybrid interfaces of physical platforms in quantum networks. Modeled as quantum communication channels, performance of unidirectional quantum transduction can be measured by the quantum channel capacity. However, characterizing performance of quantum transducers used for duplex quantum transduction where signals are converted bidirectionally remains an open question. Here, we propose rate regions to characterize the performance of duplex quantum transduction. Using this tool, we find that quantum transducers optimized for simultaneous duplex transduction can outperform strategies based on the standard protocol of time-shared unidirectional transduction. Integrated over the frequency domain, we demonstrate that rate region can also characterize quantum transducers with finite bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Autoparametric resonance extending the bit-flip time of a cat qubit up to 0.3 s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cat qubits, for which logical $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are coherent states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.</description>

      <title>Robust sparse IQP sampling in constant depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) approaches without any proof of robust quantum advantage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computation, we propose a scheme to achieve a provable superpolynomial quantum advantage (under some widely accepted complexity conjectures) that is robust to noise with minimal error correction requirements. We choose a class of sampling problems with commuting gates known as sparse IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time) circuits and we ensure its fault-tolerant implementation by introducing the tetrahelix code. This new code is obtained by merging several tetrahedral codes (3D color codes) and has the following properties: each sparse IQP gate admits a transversal implementation, and the depth of the logical circuit can be traded for its width. Combining those, we obtain a depth-1 implementation of any sparse IQP circuit up to the preparation of encoded states. This comes at the cost of a space overhead which is only polylogarithmic in the width of the original circuit. We furthermore show that the state preparation can also be performed in constant depth with a single step of feed-forward from classical computation. Our construction thus exhibits a robust superpolynomial quantum advantage for a sampling problem implemented on a constant depth circuit with a single round of measurement and feed-forward.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum approximate optimization on non-planar graphs with machine learning noise mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are increasing in size and quality, but are still very noisy. Error mitigation extends the size of the quantum circuits that noisy devices can meaningfully execute. However, state-of-the-art error mitigation methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on non-planar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to demonstrate optimization of a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our work emphasizes the need to mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic algorithms like QAOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the theory of local amplitude transfers (LAT) to gain insights into quantum walks (QWs) and quantum annealing (QA) beyond the adiabatic theorem. By representing the eigenspace of the problem Hamiltonian as a hypercube graph, we demonstrate that probability amplitude traverses the search space through a series of local Rabi oscillations. We argue that the amplitude movement can be systematically guided towards the ground state using a time-dependent hopping rate based solely on the problem's energy spectrum. Building upon these insights, we extend the concept of multi-stage QW by introducing the guided quantum walk (GQW) as a bridge between QW-like and QA-like procedures. We assess the performance of the GQW on exact cover, traveling salesperson and garden optimization problems with 9 to 30 qubits. Our results provide evidence for the existence of optimal annealing schedules, beyond the requirement of adiabatic time evolutions. These schedules might be capable of solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems within evolution times that scale linearly in the problem size.</description>

Abstract: Parametric gates and processes engineered from the perspective of the static effective Hamiltonian of a driven system are central to quantum technology. However, the perturbative expansions used to derive static effective models may not be able to efficiently capture all the relevant physics of the original system. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the validity of the usual low-order static effective Hamiltonian used to describe a Kerr oscillator under a squeezing drive. This system is of fundamental and technological interest. In particular, it has been used to stabilize Schr\"odinger cat states, which have applications for quantum computing. We compare the states and energies of the effective static Hamiltonian with the exact Floquet states and quasi-energies of the driven system and determine the parameter regime where the two descriptions agree. Our work brings to light the physics that is left out by ordinary static effective treatments and that can be explored by state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>The role of thermal and squeezed photons in the entanglement dynamics of the double Jaynes-Cummings model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of squeezed photons and thermal photons on the entanglement dynamics of atom-atom, atom-field and field-field subsystems are studied for the double Jaynes-Cummings model. For this purpose, squeezed coherent states and Glauber-Lachs states of radiation are chosen as field states. For the atomic states, we choose one of the Bell state as pure state and a Werner-type state as mixed state. Werner-type state is used to understand the effects of mixedness on entanglement. To measure the entanglement between the two atoms, Wootters' concurrence is used; whereas for the atom-field and field-field subsystems, negativity is chosen. The squeezed photons and thermal photons create, destroy and transfer entanglement within various subsystems. Also, the addition of squeezed photons and thermal photons either lengthens or shortens the duration of entanglement sudden deaths (ESD) associated with atom-atom, atom-field and field-field entanglement dynamics in a complementary way. The effects of Ising-type interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are studied. Each of these interactions removes the ESDs associated with various subsystems. We show that new entanglements are created in this atom-field system by introducing Ising-type interaction between the two atoms. With proper choice of the parameters corresponding to Ising-type interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonliearity, entanglement can be transferred among various subsystems.</description>

Abstract: We consider how to tell the time-ordering associated with measurement data from quantum experiments at two times and any number of qubits. We define an arrow of time inference problem. We consider conditions on the initial and final states that are symmetric or asymmetric under time reversal. We represent the spatiotemporal measurement data via the pseudo density matrix space-time state. There is a forward process which is CPTP and a reverse process which is obtained via a novel recovery map based on inverting unitary dilations. For asymmetric conditions, the protocol determines whether the data is consistent with the unitary dilation recovery map or the CPTP map. For symmetric conditions, the recovery map yields a valid CPTP map and the experiment may have taken place in either direction. We also discuss adapting the approach to the Leifer-Spekkens or Process matrix space-time states.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of quantum non-locality, a renowned and unique phenomenon acknowledged as a valuable resource. Focusing on a novel application, we demonstrate its quantum advantage for mobile agents engaged in specific distributed tasks without communication. The research addresses the significant challenge of rendezvous on graphs and introduces a new distributed task for mobile agents grounded in the graph domination problem. Through an investigation across various graph scenarios, we showcase the quantum advantage. Additionally, we scrutinize deterministic strategies, highlighting their comparatively lower efficiency compared to quantum strategies.

      <description>arXiv:2311.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.</description>

      <title>Hidden Variables: Rehabilitation of von Neumann's Analysis, and Pauli's Uncashable Check</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his book \textit{The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics}, published in 1932, J. von Neumann performed an analysis of the consequences of introducing hidden parameters (hidden variables) into quantum mechanics. He showed that hidden variables cannot be incorporated into the existing theory of quantum mechanics without major modifications, and concluded that if they did exist, the theory would have already failed in situations where it has been successfully applied. von Neumann left open the possibility that the theory is not complete, and his analysis for internal consistency is the best that can be done for a self-referenced logical system (G\"odel's theorem). This analysis had been taken as an ``incorrect proof" against the existence of hidden variables. von Neumann's so-called proof isn't even wrong as such a proof does not exist. One of the earliest attempts at a hidden variable theory was by D. Bohm, and because there were no experimental consequences, W. Pauli referred to it as an ``uncashable check." To our knowledge, a successful hidden variable extension to quantum mechanics with testable consequences has not yet been produced, suggesting that von Neumann's analysis is worthy of rehabilitation, which we attempt to provide in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, finding that Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Nevertheless, these also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models. We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55% reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074 Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of dilute Bose gases in 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.17183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of 1D bosons with density $\rho$, interacting through a general, repulsive 2-body potential with scattering length $a$, in the dilute limit $\rho |a|\ll1$. The first terms in the expansion of the thermodynamic energy density are $\pi^2\rho^3/3(1+2\rho a)$, where the leading order is the 1D free Fermi gas. This result covers the Tonks-Girardeau limit of the Lieb-Liniger model as a special case, but given the possibility that $a&gt;0$, it also applies to potentials that differ significantly from a delta function. We include extensions to spinless fermions and 1D anyonic symmetries, and discuss an application to confined 3D gases.</description>

      <title>Coherent Equalization of Linear Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a $H_\infty$-like methodology of coherent filtering for equalization of passive linear quantum systems to help mitigate degrading effects of quantum communication channels. For such systems, which include a wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem admits a convex $H_\infty$-like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of suboptimal coherent equalizers using $J$-spectral factorization. An additional semidefinite relaxation combined with the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is shown to lead to a tractable algorithm for the design of a near optimal coherent equalizer.</description>

      <title>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit, where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a gauge-invariant model of planar, square molecules coupled to a quantized spatially-varying cavity electromagnetic vector potential A(r). Specifically, we choose a temporally chiral cavity hosting a uniform magnetic field B, as this is the simplest instance in which a transverse spatially-varying A(r) is at play. We show that when the molecules are in the Van Vleck paramagnetic regime, an equilibrium quantum phase transition to a photon condensate state occurs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we obtain the exact solutions for bound states of tilted anisotropic Dirac materials under the action of external electric and magnetic fields with translational symmetry. In order to solve the eigenvalue equation that arises from the effective Hamiltonian of these materials, we describe an algorithm that allow us to decouple the differential equations that are obtained for the spinor components.</description>

      <title>Prethermal stability of eigenstates under high frequency Floquet driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization, that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states. We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e. coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians, with and without scars.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance in Generalized External Potential on Bose-Einstein Condensation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium, meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot $(\tau_{h})$ and cold $(\tau_{l})$ reservoir on EMP. We found that when complete thermalization, $\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$, stroke time occurs, there are no significant differences. Nevertheless, while incomplete thermalization arise, by adjusting various cooling and heating stroke time, provides a significant result on EMP, which is much higher at $\tau_{h}&lt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at $\tau_{h}&gt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this incomplete thermalization leads to the condition where residual coherence emerges which enhances the EMP of the engine.</description>

      <title>No distributed quantum advantage for approximate graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring $\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha = \bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Origin of Symmetry Breaking in the Grasshopper Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planar grasshopper problem, originally introduced in (Goulko &amp; Kent 2017 Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly, rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem. We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism, the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional calssification for topological insulators.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>

The method is based on the three-state coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and, it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.</description>
