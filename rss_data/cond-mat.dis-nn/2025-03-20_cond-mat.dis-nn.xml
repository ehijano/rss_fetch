      <title>The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural networks with diluted examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>

Abstract: Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</description>

      <title>Signal amplification in a solid-state quantum sensor via asymmetric time-reversal of many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nano-scale magnetic sensing, due to their operation under ambient conditions, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets, and biological compatibility. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits but can also potentially enhance sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room temperature quantum sensor. Our approach utilizes time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering in a two-dimensional ensemble of NV centers. Strikingly, we observe that the optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opening the door towards entanglement-enhanced practical quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Dislocations in the elastic fields of randomly distributed defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the behavior of dislocations in random solid solutions has received renewed interest, and several models have been discussed where random alloys are treated as effective media containing random distributions of dilatation and compression centers. More generally speaking, the arrangement of defects in metals and alloys is always characterized by statistical disorder, and the same is true for the fluctuating fields that arise from the superposition of the stress and strain fields of many defects. In order to develop models for the dynamics of dislocations interacting with such fields, a statistical description of the dislocation energy landscape and the associated configurational forces is needed, as well as methods for coarse graining these forces over dislocation segments of varying length and shape. In this context the problem arises how to regularize the highly singular stress fields associated with dislocations and other defects. Here we formulate an approach which is based upon evaluating the interaction energies and interaction forces between singular dislocations and other defects including solutes, modelled as point-like dilatation centers, and other dislocations. We characterize the interactions in terms of the probability densities of interaction energies and interaction forces, and the corresponding spatial correlation functions. We also consider the effects of dislocation core regularization, either in terms of continuously distributed Burgers vectors or by using the formalism of gradient elasticity of Helmholtz type to formulate a regularized energy functional.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic motion during shear deformation in metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM): Predicting Phase Transitions Across Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing phase transitions is crucial for understanding generic physical phenomena such as crystallization, protein folding and others. However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</description>

      <title>Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>

      <title>Natural Quantization of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.</description>

      <title>Symmetry- and Energy-Resolved Entanglement Dynamics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.</description>

      <title>Tunably-polarized driving light controls the phase diagram of 1D quasicrystals and 2D quantum Hall matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</description>
