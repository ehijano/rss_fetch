      <title>Towards Real-time Adaptive Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Vascular Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presented is a path towards a fast and robust adaptive anisotropic mesh generation method that is designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling process. The proposed method combines multiple software tools into a single pipeline to provide the following: (1) image-to-mesh conversion which satisfies quality, fidelity, and smoothness requirements, (2) the generation of a boundary layer grid over the high fidelity surface, (3) a parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing procedure which satisfies real-time requirements, and (4) robustness, which is satisfied by the pipeline's ability to process segmented images and CAD models. The proposed approach is tested with two brain aneurysm cases and is shown to satisfy all the aforementioned requirements. The next steps are to fully parallelize the remaining components of the pipeline to maximize potential performance and to test its integration within a CFD vascular flow simulation. Just as the parallel anisotropic adaptation procedure was tested within aerospace CFD simulations using CAD models, the method is expected to provide accurate results for CFD vascular flow simulations in real-time when executed on multicore cc-NUMA architectures.</description>

      <title>Coherent Structures Governing Transport at Turbulent Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13272v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an experiment on a turbulent jet, we detect interfacial turbulent layers in a frame that moves, on average, along with the \tnti. This significantly prolongs the observation time of scalar and velocity structures and enables the measurement of two types of Lagrangian coherent structures. One structure, the finite-time Lyapunov field (FTLE), quantifies advective transport barriers of fluid parcels while the other structure highlights barriers of diffusive momentum transport. These two complementary structures depend on large-scale and small-scale motion and are therefore associated with the growth of the turbulent region through engulfment or nibbling, respectively. We detect the \tnti\ from cluster analysis, where we divide the measured scalar field into four clusters. Not only the \tnti\ can be found this way, but also the next, internal, turbulent-turbulent interface. Conditional averages show that these interfaces are correlated with barriers of advective and diffusive transport when the Lagrangian integration time is smaller than the integral time scale. Diffusive structures decorrelate faster since they have a smaller timescale. Conditional averages of these structures at internal turbulent-turbulent interfaces show the same pattern with a more pronounced jump at the interface indicative of a shear layer. This is quite an unexpected outcome, as the internal interface is now defined not by the presence or absence of vorticity, but by conditional vorticity corresponding to two uniform concentration zones. The long-time diffusive momentum flux along Lagrangian paths represents the growth of the turbulent flow into the irrotational domain, a direct demonstration of nibbling. The diffusive flux parallel to the \tnti\ appears to be concentrated in a diffusive superlayer whose width is comparable with the Taylor microscale, which is relatively invariant in time.</description>

      <title>Spatial evolution of droplet size and velocity characteristics in a swirl spray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spray drop size distribution generated by atomization of fuel influences several facets of a combustion process such as, fuel-air mixing, reaction kinetics and thrust generation. In a typical spray, the drop size distribution evolves spatially, varying significantly between the near and far regions of the spray. Studies so far have focused on either one of these regions and are unclear on the exact axial location of transition. In this work, we address this crucial gap by considering a swirl atomizer and measuring the droplet characteristics for different liquid flow conditions of the ensuing spray at various radial and axial locations. Our results reveal an axial variation in the scaled radial droplet velocity profiles, not followed by the radial drop size profiles, from which we demarcate the near region as the zone which extends to 2.0 to 2.5 times film breakup length. Beyond this distance, the drop size characteristics are influenced by external factors such as airflow and identified as the far region. Further, we locate the point of origin of the droplet high-velocity stream along the spray centreline to the end of film breakup of the spray. We also find that the global probability density functions for droplet size and velocity which show a bimodal behavior in the near-region and unimodal in the far-region being well represented by the double Gaussian and Gamma distributions, respectively. We further quantify our results by number and volume flux distributions, global mean drop sizes, drop size ($D_d$) axial velocity ($U_a$) correlations, axial velocity based on drop size classification and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) to reveal the effect of drop inertia and air flow in determining the statistics in both the near and far regions. We anticipate the findings of this work will guide future investigations on combustion processes and combustor design based on spray characteristics.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length scale $z_0$ for turbulent flow over static rough surfaces is reformulated and extended to enable evaluation of $z_0$ for moving surface waves. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length model is based on maps of the surface height and its vertical speed as function of position, and Reynolds number. Pressure drag is estimated by approximating the local flow as ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al., 2024). Wave history effects are included through dependence on the local velocity difference between the air and wave speed. The model is applied to monochromatic and multiscale surfaces, and the predicted surface roughness length scales are compared to measured values and to commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. The proposed model shows significantly improved agreement with data compared to other models.</description>

      <title>Linear stability and resolvent analyses of a bluff-body stabilized flame with conjugate heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugate heat transfer is a challenging fluid-structure coupling problem that can significantly influence flame stabilization and thermoacoustic instabilities. To properly capture combustion phenomena that involve conjugate heat transfer, careful modeling of chemical reactions in the fluid domain and heat transfer in the solid body is necessary and remains an active research topic. To this end, we derived a strongly-coupled method with a monolithic weak formulation to investigate the conjugate heat transfer between an anchored flame and a thermal conductive cylinder by means of linear stability analysis and resolvent analysis. We conduct parameter continuation with the Damkohler number to construct a bifurcation diagram and identify multiple baseflow states, including blow-off, anchored flame, and flashback. Linear stability analysis reveals the presence of a single unstable, non-oscillatory eigenmode for the base states on the anchored flame branch. This eigenmode plays a pivotal role in driving the bifurcation. Subsequently, resolvent analysis is performed to examine the amplification behavior of the fluid-solid coupled system under external forcing, showing that heat fluctuations are maximized when heat transfer between the fluid and solid is minimized.</description>

      <title>Modeling the free-surface magnetohydrodynamics of thick liquid metal walls for fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renaissance Fusion proposes thick liquid metal walls as plasma-facing components for future commercial fusion reactors. It designs and operates proof-of-concept experiments aiming at actively suspending and stabilizing a flowing free-surface liquid metal layer against gravity using Lorentz forces. The first operating prototype consists of a 1 m-diameter chamber in the presence of a magnetic field of the order of 0.3 T. A GaInSn flow is injected inside the chamber, and it is actively suspended thanks to the injection of currents up to 3 kA. To simulate the prototype, a numerical tool capable of modeling magnetohydrodynamics phenomena in two-phase flows has been developed to reproduce and interpret the experimental results. The tool relies on the low-magnetic Reynolds assumption, implements the Volume-of-Fluid method for tracking the free-surface, and couples the electric potential in both fluid and solid domains.</description>

      <title>Reducing Foam Friction with Self Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between foam friction and surface roughness is essential for achieving precise control over their flow dynamics. In particular, a major challenge is to reduce friction, which can be achieved with rough surfaces in the situation where a liquid infuses the asperities. In this study, we propose to explore self-infused surfaces. We first present simple observations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our surface design by recording the motion of a foam puddle on a smooth surface and a self-SLIPS. To quantify friction reduction, we conduct stress measurements on surfaces moved at a constant velocity. Finally, we interpret the variation of the friction force with the velocity by a model considering an effective slip length of the surface. This research paves the way for a novel approach to mitigate dissipation in liquid foam flows, holding significant implications for reducing energy consumption in conveying foams for industrial processes and various end-use applications.</description>

      <title>Recent developments and research needs in turbulence modeling of hypersonic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypersonic flow conditions pose exceptional challenges for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. Critical phenomena include compressibility effects, shock/turbulent boundary layer interactions, turbulence-chemistry interaction in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium, and ablation-induced surface roughness and blowing effects. This comprehensive review synthesizes recent developments in adapting turbulence models to hypersonic applications, examining approaches ranging from empirical modifications to physics-based reformulations and novel data-driven methodologies. We provide a systematic evaluation of current RANS-based turbulence modeling capabilities, comparing eddy viscosity and Reynolds stress transport formulations in their ability to predict engineering quantities of interest such as separation characteristics and wall heat transfer. Our analysis encompasses the latest experimental and direct numerical simulation datasets for validation, specifically addressing two- and three-dimensional equilibrium turbulent boundary layers and shock/turbulent boundary layer interactions across both smooth and rough surfaces. Key multi-physics considerations including catalysis and ablation phenomena along with the integration of conjugate heat transfer into a RANS solver for efficient design of a thermal protection system are also discussed. We conclude by identifying the critical gaps in the available validation databases and limitations of the existing turbulence models and suggest potential areas for future research to improve the fidelity of turbulence modeling in the hypersonic regime.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for Data Compression of Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of high-performance computing has enabled the generation of large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulent flows, driving the need for efficient compression/decompression techniques that reduce storage demands while maintaining fidelity. Traditional methods, such as the discrete wavelet transform, cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex turbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On the other hand, super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SR-GANs) can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features, preserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression ratio of 512, thanks to the adversarial training enabled by the discriminator. Their high training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer learning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that SR-GANs can enhance dataset temporal resolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality intermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The SR-GAN discriminator can reliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the absence of original DNS fields. Hence, SR-GAN-based compression/decompression methods present a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS storage and transfer, offering substantial advantages in terms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal resolution enhancement.</description>

      <title>Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between mass transfer and hydrodynamic phenomena in two-phase flow is not necessarily straightforward due to the different effects that can be encountered. The treatment of such coupling is complex and requires particular efforts, especially in the modelling of the interface between phases. In this paper, we consider the case of a droplet composed of two components (one miscible and one immiscible in water) released in a 2D rectangular domain filled with water. Mass transfer occurs between the miscible element and the surrounding water, which leads to a density inversion that directly affects the droplet trajectory through buoyancy. We perform simulations using a ternary Cahn-Hilliard model (implemented in the "phase\_field" model of the TrioCFD code) to capture such coupled phenomena. The Boussinesq approximation for a multicomponent system is used to define the density law and an analytical chemical potential is proposed for the thermodynamic landscape. The effect of the mobility parameter on the flow is highlighted and the results found are in good agreement with the dynamics described from an experimental study of the open literature.</description>

      <title>Topological Separation of Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed "layering". Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., $\lambda_2$), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Inertial focusing of spherical capsule in pulsatile channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical analysis of the lateral movement of spherical capsule in the steady and pulsatile channel flow of a Newtonian fluid, for a wide range of oscillatory frequency. Each capsule membrane satisfying strain-hardening characteristic is simulated for different Reynolds numbers Re and capillary numbers Ca. Our numerical results showed that capsules with high Ca exhibit axial focusing at finite Re similarly to the inertialess case. We observe that the speed of the axial focusing can be substantially accelerated by making the driving pressure gradient oscillating in time. We also confirm the existence of an optimal frequency which maximises the speed of axial focusing, that remains the same found in the absence of inertia. For relatively low Ca, on the other hand, the capsule exhibits off-centre focusing, resulting in various equilibrium radial positions depending on Re. Our numerical results further clarifies the existence of a specific Re for which the effect of the flow pulsation to the equilibrium radial position is maximum. The roles of channel size on the lateral movements of the capsule are also addressed. Throughout our analyses, we have quantified the radial position of the capsule in a tube based on an empirical expression. Given that the speed of inertial focusing can be controlled by the oscillatory frequency, the results obtained here can be utilised for label-free cell alignment/sorting/separation techniques, e.g., for circulating tumor cells in cancer patients or precious hematopoietic cells such as colony-forming cells.</description>

      <title>Thunderscapes: Simulating the Dynamics of Mesoscale Convective System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00703</link>

Abstract: A Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms that function as a system, representing a widely discussed phenomenon in both the natural sciences and visual effects industries, and embodying the untamed forces of nature.In this paper, we present the first interactive, physically inspired mesoscale thunderstorms simulation model that integrates Grabowski-style cloud microphysics with atmospheric electrification processes. Our model simulates thunderclouds development and lightning flashes within a unified meteorological framework, providing a realistic and interactive approach for graphical applications. By incorporating key physical principles, it effectively links cloud formation, electrification, and lightning generation. The simulation also encompasses various thunderstorm types and their corresponding lightning activities.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>

Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>
