      <title>First-Order Logic and Twin-Width for Some Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some geometric graph classes, tractability of testing first-order formulas is precisely characterised by the graph parameter twin-width. This was first proved for interval graphs among others in [BCKKLT, IPEC '22], where the equivalence is called delineation, and more generally holds for circle graphs, rooted directed path graphs, and $H$-graphs when $H$ is a forest. Delineation is based on the key idea that geometric graphs often admit natural vertex orderings, allowing to use the very rich theory of twin-width for ordered graphs.
  Answering two questions raised in their work, we prove that delineation holds for intersection graphs of non-degenerate axis-parallel unit segment graphs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. We also prove delineation for intersection graphs of circular arcs.</description>

      <title>Pushing Cops and Robber on Graphs of Maximum Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textsc{Cops and Robber} is a game played on graphs where a set of \textit{cops} aim to \textit{capture} the position of a single \textit{robber}. The main parameter of interest in this game is the \textit{cop number}, which is the minimum number of cops that are sufficient to guarantee the capture of the robber.
  In a directed graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the \textit{push} operation on a vertex $v$ reverses the orientation of all arcs incident on $v$. We consider a variation of classical \textsc{Cops and Robber} on oriented graphs, where in its turn, each cop can either move to an out-neighbor of its current vertex or push some vertex of the graph, whereas, the robber can move to an adjacent vertex in its turn. [Das et al., CALDAM, 2023] introduced this variant and established that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a subcubic graph, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy. We extend these results to establish that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a $3$-degenerate graph, or of a graph with maximum degree $4$, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy.</description>
