      <title>Coarse extrinsic curvature of Riemannian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Y. Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, we introduce a novel concept of coarse extrinsic curvature on Riemannian submanifolds. This is defined through Wasserstein distances between test probability measures supported in the tubular neighbourhood of the submanifold. This framework provides an understanding of the geometric properties of embeddings, offering valuable insights into their curvature dynamics and intrinsic structures. Additionally, this coarse curvature can also be extracted from empirical measures supported on random point clouds generated by a Poisson point process, and has the potential to extend to metric embeddings.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of flag bundles over compact Hermitian locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E\to B$ be a complex analytic fiber bundle with fiber $F$, a flag variety over a compact complex manifold $B$. We shall obtain a description of the cohomology of $E$ when $B=X_\Gamma:=\Gamma\backslash X, E=Y_\Gamma:=\Gamma\backslash Y$ and $F=K/H$, a flag variety, where $Y=G/H$ and $X=G/K$, a Hermitian globally symmetric space of non-compact type with $G$ being a real, connected, non-compact, semisimple linear Lie group with no compact factors and simply connected complexification, $K\subset G$, a maximal compact subgroup, $H=Z_K(S)$, the centralizer in $K$ of a toral subgroup $S\subseteq K$ containing $Z(K)$, the center of $K$ and $\Gamma\subset G$, a uniform and torsionless lattice in $G$. We also obtain a description of the Picard group of $Y_\Gamma$ and $X_{\Gamma}$, for which the complexification of $G$ need not be simply connected. Moreover when $G$ is simple, we obtain the values of $ q$ for which $H^{p,q}(X_\Gamma)$ vanishes when $p=0,1$. This extends the results of R. Parthasarathy from $1980$, who considered (partially) the case $p=0$.</description>

      <title>Regularity of viscosity solutions of the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe-type Problem for $k&gt;n/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of Lipschitz viscosity solutions to the $\sigma_k$ Yamabe problem in the negative cone case. If either $k=n$ or the manifold is conformally flat and $k&gt;n/2$, we prove that all Lipschitz viscosity solutions are smooth away from a closed set of measure zero. For the general $k&gt;n/2$ case, under certain assumptions, we prove the existence of a Lipschitz viscosity solution that is smooth away from a closed set of measure zero.</description>

      <title>The prescribed metric on the boundary of convex subsets of anti-de Sitter space with a quasi-circle as ideal boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ be two complete, conformal metrics on the disc $\mathbb{D}$. Assume moreover that the derivatives of the conformal factors of the metrics $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ are bounded at any order with respect to the hyperbolic metric, and that the metrics have curvatures in the interval $\left(-\frac{1}{\epsilon}, -1 - \epsilon\right)$, for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Let $f$ be a quasi-symmetric map. We show the existence of a globally hyperbolic convex subset $\Omega$ (see Definition 3.1) of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, such that $\Omega$ has $h^{+}$ (respectively $h^{-}$) as the induced metric on its future boundary (respectively on its past boundary) and has a gluing map $\Phi_{\Omega}$ (see Definition 4.5) equal to $f$.</description>

      <title>Convergences of Combinatorial Ricci Flows to Degenerated Circle Packings in Hyperbolic Background Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a kind of degenerated circle packings in hyperbolic background geometry. A main problem is whether a prescribed total geodesic curvature data can be realized by a degenerated circle packing or not. We fully characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions and show the uniqueness. Furthermore, we introduce the combinatoral Ricci flow to find the desired degenerated circle packed surface, analougus to the methods of Chow-Luo and Takatsu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant vanishing results regarding anomalies.</description>

      <title>Ding stability and K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on manifolds with big anticanonical class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of uniform Ding stability for a projective manifold with big anticanonical class, and prove that the existence of a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric on such a manifold implies uniform Ding stability. The main new techniques are to develop a general theory of Deligne functionals - and corresponding slope formulas - for singular metrics, and to prove a slope formula for the Ding functional in the big setting. This extends work of Berman in the Fano situation, when the anticanonical class is actually ample, and proves one direction of the analogue of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture in this setting. We also speculate about the relevance of uniform Ding stability and K-stability to moduli in the big setting.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow calculations for reducible solutions to the massive Vafa-Witten equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vafa-Witten equations (with or without a mass term) constitute a non-linear, first order system of differential equations on a given oriented, compact, Riemannian 4-manifold. Because these are the variational equations of a functional, the linearized equations at any given solution can be used to define an elliptic, first order, self-adjoint differential operator. The purpose of this article is to give bounds (upper and lower) for the spectral flow between respective versions of this operator that are defined by the elements in diverging sequences of reducible solutions. (The spectral flow is formally the difference between the respective Morse indices of the solutions when they are viewed as critical points of the functional.) In some cases, the absolute value of the spectral flow is bounded along the sequence, whereas in others it diverges. This is a curious state of affairs. In any event, the analysis introduces localization and excision techniques to calculate spectral flow which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Urysohn 1-width for 4 and 5 manifolds with positive biRicci curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was proved by Gromov-Lawson\cite{gl83} that complete three manifold with positive scalar curvature bounded below has finite Urysohn 1-width only depends on the uniform positive scalar curvature bounds. It is natural to ask the same question for the four manifolds. In this paper, we can show that closed four and five manifolds with positive biRicci curvature has finite Urysohn 1-width only depends on the curvature bounds. During the proof we can also observe that the fundamental group of those manifolds are virtually free. This gives a quick application that $T^{2}\times S^{2}$ can't admit positive biRicci curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any twisted ideal polygon in $\mathbb{H}^3$, we construct a harmonic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}^3$ with a polynomial Hopf differential, that is asymptotic to the given polygon, and is a bounded distance from a pleated plane. Our proof uses the harmonic map heat flow. We also show that such a harmonic map is unique once we prescribe the principal part of its Hopf differential.</description>

      <title>On Sp(n)-Instantons and the Fourier-Mukai Transform of Complex Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real Fourier-Mukai (RFM) transform relates calibrated graphs to so-called "deformed instantons" on Hermitian line bundles. We show that under the RFM transform, complex Lagrangian graphs in $R^{2n} \times T^{2n}$ correspond to Sp($n$)-instantons over $R^{2n} \times (T^{2n})^*$. In other words, the deformed Sp($n$)-instanton equation coincides with the usual Sp($n$)-instanton equation.
  Motivated by this observation, we study Sp($n$)-instantons on hyperkahler manifolds $X^{4n}$, with an emphasis on conical singularities. First, when $X = C(M)$ is a hyperkahler cone, we relate Sp($n$)-instantons on $X$ to tri-contact instantons on the 3-Sasakian link $M$ and consider various dimensional reductions. Second, when $X$ is an asymptotically conical (AC) hyperkahler manifold of rate $\nu \leq -\frac{2}{3}(2n+1)$, we prove a Lewis-type theorem to the following effect: If the set of AC Sp($n$)-instantons is non-empty, then every AC Hermitian Yang-Mills connection over $X$ with sufficiently fast decay at infinity is an Sp($n$)-instanton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1211.6633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under certain topological assumptions, we show that two monotone Lagrangian submanifolds embedded in the standard symplectic vector space with the same monotonicity constant cannot link one another and that, individually, their smooth knot type is determined entirely by the homotopy theoretic data which classifies the underlying Lagrangian immersion. The topological assumptions are satisfied by a large class of manifolds which are realised as monotone Lagrangians, including tori. After some additional homotopy theoretic calculations, we deduce that all monotone Lagrangian tori in the symplectic vector space of odd complex dimension at least five are smoothly isotopic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common method for estimating the Hessian operator from random samples on a low-dimensional manifold involves locally fitting a quadratic polynomial. Although widely used, it is unclear if this estimator introduces bias, especially in complex manifolds with boundaries and nonuniform sampling. Rigorous theoretical guarantees of its asymptotic behavior have been lacking. We show that, under mild conditions, this estimator asymptotically converges to the Hessian operator, with nonuniform sampling and curvature effects proving negligible, even near boundaries. Our analysis framework simplifies the intensive computations required for direct analysis.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
