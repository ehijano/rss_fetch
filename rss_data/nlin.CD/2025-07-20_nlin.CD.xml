      <title>Time series analysis of coupled slow-fast neuron models: From Hurst exponent to Granger causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform time series analysis of small networks where every node is the slow-fast version of the denatured Morris--Lecar neuron proposed by Schaeffer and Cain. We choose popular coupling strategies from the literature and provide a detailed account of how varying their strength drives the dynamics of the small networks. Algorithms for time series analysis range from measuring their persistence (ability to remember past values), irregularity, chaos and quasiperiodicity, to synchronization between time series from every node within a network. Chaos is observed for inhibitory coupling strengths and for temperature higher than a reference temperature when the coupling is thermally sensitive. We observe quasi-periodicity when the coupling is very weak and synchronized bursting for highly excitatory coupling strength. In certain cases we also observe decay oscillations. Finally, a causality test is performed to detect whether the dynamics of one neuron is influencing the dynamics of the other in the coupled system.</description>

      <title>The Hofstadter Butterfly: Bridging Condensed Matter, Topology, and Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celebrating its golden jubilee, the Hofstadter butterfly fractal emerges as a remarkable fusion of art and science. This iconic X shaped fractal captivates physicists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts alike by elegantly illustrating the energy spectrum of electrons within a two dimensional crystal lattice influenced by a magnetic field. Enriched with integers of topological origin that serve as quanta of Hall conductivity, this quantum fractal and its variations have become paradigm models for topological insulators, novel states of matter in 21st century physics. This paper delves into the theoretical framework underlying butterfly fractality through the lenses of geometry and number theory. Within this poetic mathematics, we witness a rare form of quantum magic: Natures use of abstract fractals in crafting the butterfly graph itself. In its simplest form, the butterfly graph tessellates a two dimensional plane with trapezoids and triangles, where the quanta of Hall conductivity are embedded in the integer sloped diagonals of the trapezoids. The theoretical framework is succinctly expressed through unimodular matrices with integer coefficients, bringing to life abstract constructs such as the Farey tree, the Apollonian gaskets, and the Pythagorean triplet tree.</description>

      <title>Identification and Computation of Slow Manifolds Using the Isostable Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman analysis can be used to understand the dynamics of a nonlinear dynamical system in terms a linear, but generally infinite dimensional operator. The isostable coordinate system focuses on the slowest decaying principal Koopman eigenmodes. This work leverages the isostable coordinate framework in the identification of slow manifolds for dynamical systems with fixed point attractors, defined as surfaces for which the fastest decaying isostable coordinates are zero. Numerical challenges associated with separation between fast and slow timescales necessitate the development of new computational approaches to identify these slow manifolds. Two such strategies are developed which approximate backward-time solutions on the slow manifold starting near the fixed point and extending far beyond the linear regime. Application to a variety of examples illustrates the utility of these methods and their potential use for model order reduction purposes.</description>

      <title>Markov matrix perturbations to optimize dynamical and entropy functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important problem in applied dynamical systems is to compute the external forcing that provokes the largest response of a desired observable quantity. For this, we investigate the perturbation theory of Markov matrices in connection with linear response theory in statistical physics. We use perturbative expansions to derive linear algorithms to optimize physically relevant quantities such as: entropy, Kullback-Liebler-divergence and entropy production of Markov matrices and their related probability vectors. These optimization algorithms are applied to Markov chain representations of discrete and continuous flows in and out of equilibrium. We consider Markov matrix representations originating from Ulam-type approximations of transfer operators and a reduced order model of a turbulent flow based on unstable periodic orbits theory. We also propose a numerical protocol to recast matrix perturbations into vector field perturbations. The results allow to physically interpret the obtained optimizing perturbations without knowledge of the underlying equations, in a data-driven way.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Learning in Lagrangian Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation - initially developed for energy-based models - to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>
