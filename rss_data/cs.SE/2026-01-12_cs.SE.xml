      <title>DafnyPro: LLM-Assisted Automated Verification for Dafny Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DafnyPro, an inference-time framework that enhances LLMs for generating verification annotations in Dafny. DafnyPro comprises three key components: a diff-checker that prevents modifications to base program logic, a pruner that removes unnecessary invariants, and a hint-augmentation system that retrieves and applies predefined, problem-independent proof strategies. We evaluate DafnyPro using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 on four benchmarks: Clover, MBPP-Dafny, HumanEval-Dafny, and DafnyBench, achieving consistent performance gains in all cases. Notably, on DafnyBench, the most challenging benchmark, Claude Sonnet 3.5 enhanced with DafnyPro achieves 86% correct proofs, a 16 pp improvement over the base model. We also fine-tune two Qwen models on training data derived from verification attempts by larger models enhanced with DafnyPro. Our 7B and 14B models achieve 68% and 70% correct proofs on DafnyBench, respectively, demonstrating that smaller models can maintain high verification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Failures in Cyber-Physical System State Transitions: A Fuzzing-Based Approach Applied to sUAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) in diverse and often safety-critical environments demands rigorous validation of onboard decision logic under various conditions. In this paper, we present SaFUZZ, a state-aware fuzzing pipeline that validates core behavior associated with state transitions, automated failsafes, and human operator interactions in sUAS applications operating under various timing conditions and environmental disturbances. We create fuzzing specifications to detect behavioral deviations, and then dynamically generate associated Fault Trees to visualize states, modes, and environmental factors that contribute to the failure, thereby helping project stakeholders to analyze the failure and identify its root causes. We validated SaFUZZ against a real-world sUAS system and were able to identify several points of failure not previously detected by the system's development team. The fuzzing was conducted in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and outcomes were validated on physical sUAS in a real-world field testing setting. The findings from the study demonstrated SaFUZZ's ability to provide a practical and scalable approach to uncovering diverse state transition failures in a real-world sUAS application.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Basis Path Testing: Mixed Integer Programming Approach for Test Path Set Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basis path testing is a cornerstone of structural testing, yet traditional automated methods, relying on greedy graph-traversal algorithms (e.g., DFS/BFS), often generate sub-optimal paths. This structural inferiority is not a trivial issue; it directly impedes downstream testing activities by complicating automated test data generation and increasing the cognitive load for human engineers. This paper reframes basis path generation from a procedural search task into a declarative optimization problem. We introduce a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework designed to produce a complete basis path set that is globally optimal in its structural simplicity. Our framework includes two complementary strategies: a Holistic MIP model that guarantees a theoretically optimal path set, and a scalable Incremental MIP strategy for large, complex topologies. The incremental approach features a multi-objective function that prioritizes path simplicity and incorporates a novelty penalty to maximize the successful generation of linearly independent paths. Empirical evaluations on both real-code and large-scale synthetic Control Flow Graphs demonstrate that our Incremental MIP strategy achieves a 100\% success rate in generating complete basis sets, while remaining computationally efficient. Our work provides a foundational method for generating a high-quality structural "scaffold" that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of subsequent test generation efforts.</description>

      <title>STELP: Secure Transpilation and Execution of LLM-Generated Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</description>

      <title>Readability-Robust Code Summarization via Meta Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code summarization has emerged as a fundamental technique in the field of program comprehension. While code language models have shown significant advancements, the current models and benchmarks are confined to high-readability code, which contains sufficient semantic cues such as function and variable names. In the real world, however, code is often poorly structured or obfuscated, significantly degrading model performance. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art language models on poor-readability code for the task of code summarization, focusing on (1) their effectiveness, (2) the impact of prompt engineering, and (3) the robustness of different variants. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models-including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 experience a substantial performance drop when faced with poorly readable code, and that prompt engineering and reasoning-enhanced models offer limited improvements. Motivated by these findings, we propose RoFTCodeSum, a novel fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of code summarization against poorly readable code. RoFTCodeSum marries the concepts of curriculum learning and meta-learning: based on the original dataset for fine-tuning, it creates curricular training sets, e.g., obfuscating function names and identifiers from the code, respectively, that have progressive difficulty in code comprehension. In each training step, the approach meta-updates the gradients using these progressively challenging datasets, thereby optimizing both accuracy and readability robustness simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that RoFTCodeSum exhibits increased robustness against semantic perturbation while enhancing performance on the original code.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Automated DOM-Level Resolution of Web Performance Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users demand fast, seamless webpage experiences, yet developers often struggle to meet these expectations within tight constraints. Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO &amp; Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently. A further analysis of these modifications showed a predominant additive strategy and frequent positional changes, alongside regressions particularly impacting Visual Stability.</description>

      <title>LIDL: LLM Integration Defect Localization via Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-integrated software, which embeds or interacts with large language models (LLMs) as functional components, exhibits probabilistic and context-dependent behaviors that fundamentally differ from those of traditional software. This shift introduces a new category of integration defects that arise not only from code errors but also from misaligned interactions among LLM-specific artifacts, including prompts, API calls, configurations, and model outputs. However, existing defect localization techniques are ineffective at identifying these LLM-specific integration defects because they fail to capture cross-layer dependencies across heterogeneous artifacts, cannot exploit incomplete or misleading error traces, and lack semantic reasoning capabilities for identifying root causes.
  To address these challenges, we propose LIDL, a multi-agent framework for defect localization in LLM-integrated software. LIDL (1) constructs a code knowledge graph enriched with LLM-aware annotations that represent interaction boundaries across source code, prompts, and configuration files, (2) fuses three complementary sources of error evidence inferred by LLMs to surface candidate defect locations, and (3) applies context-aware validation that uses counterfactual reasoning to distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. We evaluate LIDL on 146 real-world defect instances collected from 105 GitHub repositories and 16 agent-based systems. The results show that LIDL significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving a Top-3 accuracy of 0.64 and a MAP of 0.48, which represents a 64.1% improvement over the best-performing baseline. Notably, LIDL achieves these gains while reducing cost by 92.5%, demonstrating both high accuracy and cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Empirical Characterization of Logging Smells in Machine Learning Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \underline{Context:} Logging is a fundamental yet complex practice in software engineering, essential for monitoring, debugging, and auditing software systems. With the increasing integration of machine learning (ML) components into software systems, effective logging has become critical to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and observability throughout model training and deployment. Although various general-purpose and ML-specific logging frameworks exist, little is known about how these tools are actually used in practice or whether ML practitioners adopt consistent and effective logging strategies. To date, no empirical study has systematically characterized recurring bad logging practices--or logging smells--in ML System. \underline{Goal:} This study aims to empirically identify and characterize logging smells in ML systems, providing an evidence-based understanding of how logging is implemented and challenged in practice. \underline{Method:} We propose to conduct a large-scale mining of open-source ML repositories hosted on GitHub to catalogue recurring logging smells. Subsequently, a practitioner survey involving ML engineers will be conducted to assess the perceived relevance, severity, and frequency of the identified smells. \underline{Limitations:} % While The study's limitations include that While our findings may not be generalizable to closed-source industrial projects, we believe our study provides an essential step toward understanding and improving logging practices in ML development.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM-Driven Test Oracle Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated unit test generation aims to improve software quality while reducing the time and effort required for creating tests manually. However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles. Our findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based oracle generation in the FM era, improving our understanding of their capabilities and fostering future research in this area.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Policy-as-Code Adoption in Open-Source Software Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Context:} Policy-as-Code (PaC) has become a foundational approach for embedding governance, compliance, and security requirements directly into software systems. While organizations increasingly adopt PaC tools, the software engineering community lacks an empirical understanding of how these tools are used in real-world development practices.
  \textbf{Objective:} This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale study of PaC usage in open-source software. Our goal is to characterize how PaC tools are adopted, what purposes they serve, and what governance activities they support across diverse software ecosystems.
  \textbf{Method:} We analyzed 399 GitHub repositories using nine widely adopted PaC tools. Our mixed-methods approach combines quantitative analysis of tool usage and project characteristics with a qualitative investigation of policy files. We further employ a Large Language Model (LLM)--assisted classification pipeline, refined through expert validation, to derive a taxonomy of PaC usage consisting of 5 categories and 15 sub-categories.
  \textbf{Results:} Our study reveals substantial diversity in PaC adoption. PaC tools are frequently used in early-stage projects and are heavily oriented toward governance, configuration control, and documentation. We also observe emerging PaC usage in MLOps pipelines and strong co-usage patterns, such as between OPA and Gatekeeper. Our taxonomy highlights recurring governance intents.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} Our findings offer actionable insights for practitioners and tool developers. They highlight concrete usage patterns, emphasize actual PaC usage, and motivate opportunities for improving tool interoperability. This study lays the empirical foundation for future research on PaC practices and their role in ensuring trustworthy, compliant software systems.</description>

      <title>Package-Aware Approach for Repository-Level Code Completion in Pharo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pharo offers a sophisticated completion engine based on semantic heuristics, which coordinates specific fetchers within a lazy architecture. These heuristics can be recomposed to support various activities (e.g., live programming or history usage navigation). While this system is powerful, it does not account for the repository structure when suggesting global names such as class names, class variables, or global variables. As a result, it does not prioritize classes within the same package or project, treating all global names equally. In this paper, we present a new heuristic that addresses this limitation. Our approach searches variable names in a structured manner: it begins with the package of the requesting class, then expands to other packages within the same repository, and finally considers the global namespace. We describe the logic behind this heuristic and evaluate it against the default semantic heuristic and one that directly queries the global namespace. Preliminary results indicate that the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) improves, confirming that package-awareness completions deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions than the previous flat global approach.</description>

      <title>A Large Scale Empirical Analysis on the Adherence Gap between Standards and Tools in SBOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable artifact that systematically organizes software information, enhancing supply chain transparency and security. To facilitate the exchange and utilization of SBOMs, organizations such as the Linux Foundation and OWASP have proposed SBOM standards. Following standards, organizations have developed tools for generating and utilizing SBOMs. However, limited research has examined the adherence of these SBOM tools to standard specifications, a gap that could lead to compliance failures and disruptions in SBOM utilization. This paper presents the first large-scale, two-stage empirical analysis of the adherence gap, using our automated evaluation framework, SAP. The evaluation, comprising a baseline evaluation and a one-year longitudinal follow-up, covers 55,444 SBOMs generated by six SBOM tools from 3,287 real-world repositories. Our analysis reveals persistent, fundamental limitations in current SBOM tools: (1) inadequate compliance support with policy requirements; (2) poor tool consistencies, including inter-tool consistency rates as low as 7.84% to 12.77% for package detection across languages, and significant longitudinal inconsistency, where tools show low consistency with their own prior versions; and (3) mediocre to poor accuracy for detailed software information, e.g., accuracy of package licenses below 20%. We analyze the root causes of these gaps and provide practical solutions. All the code, replication docker image, evaluation results are open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/dw763j/SAP) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14998624) for further researches.</description>

      <title>Tracing Stereotypes in Pre-trained Transformers: From Biased Neurons to Fairer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of transformer-based language models has reshaped how AI systems process and generate text. In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.</description>

      <title>Drivora: A Unified and Extensible Infrastructure for Search-based Autonomous Driving Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search-based testing is critical for evaluating the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). However, existing approaches are often built on heterogeneous frameworks (e.g., distinct scenario spaces, simulators, and ADSs), which require considerable effort to reuse and adapt across different settings. To address these challenges, we present Drivora, a unified and extensible infrastructure for search-based ADS testing built on the widely used CARLA simulator. Drivora introduces a unified scenario definition, OpenScenario, that specifies scenarios using low-level, actionable parameters to ensure compatibility with existing methods while supporting extensibility to new testing designs (e.g., multi-autonomous-vehicle testing). On top of this, Drivora decouples the testing engine, scenario execution, and ADS integration. The testing engine leverages evolutionary computation to explore new scenarios and supports flexible customization of core components. The scenario execution can run arbitrary scenarios using a parallel execution mechanism that maximizes hardware utilization for large-scale batch simulation. For ADS integration, Drivora provides access to 12 ADSs through a unified interface, streamlining configuration and simplifying the incorporation of new ADSs. Our tools are publicly available at https://github.com/MingfeiCheng/Drivora.</description>

      <title>AIBoMGen: Generating an AI Bill of Materials for Secure, Transparent, and Compliant Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex AI systems has outpaced the development of tools to ensure their transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. In this paper, the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), an extension of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is introduced as a standardized, verifiable record of trained AI models and their environments. Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job. The system uses cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and in-toto attestations to ensure integrity and protect against threats such as artifact tampering by dishonest model creators. Our evaluation demonstrates that AIBoMGen reliably detects unauthorized modifications to all artifacts and can generate AIBOMs with negligible performance overhead. These results highlight the potential of AIBoMGen as a foundational step toward building secure and transparent AI ecosystems, enabling compliance with regulatory frameworks like the EUs AI Act.</description>

      <title>From Issues to Insights: RAG-based Explanation Generation from Software Engineering Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems has made understanding their behavior increasingly challenging, driving the need for explainability to improve transparency and user trust. Traditional documentation is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult to derive accurate, context-specific explanations. Meanwhile, issue-tracking systems capture rich and continuously updated development knowledge, but their potential for explainability remains untapped. With this work, we are the first to apply a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for generating explanations from issue-tracking data. Our proof-of-concept system is implemented using open-source tools and language models, demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging structured issue data for explanation generation. Evaluating our approach on an exemplary project's set of GitHub issues, we achieve 90% alignment with human-written explanations. Additionally, our system exhibits strong faithfulness and instruction adherence, ensuring reliable and grounded explanations. These findings suggest that RAG-based methods can extend explainability beyond black-box ML models to a broader range of software systems, provided that issue-tracking data is available - making system behavior more accessible and interpretable.</description>

      <title>StriderSPD: Structure-Guided Joint Representation Learning for Binary Security Patch Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</description>

      <title>EET: Experience-Driven Early Termination for Cost-Efficient Software Engineering Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software engineering (SE) agents powered by large language models are increasingly adopted in practice, yet they often incur substantial monetary cost. We introduce EET, an experience-driven early termination approach that reduces the cost of SE agents while preserving task performance. EET extracts structured experience from prior issue-resolution executions and leverages it to guide early termination during patch generation and selection, reducing unproductive iterations. We evaluate EET on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark across three representative SE agents. EET consistently reduces total cost by 19%-55% (32% on average), with negligible loss in resolution rate (at most 0.2%). These efficiency gains are achieved, on average, by identifying early-termination opportunities for 11% of issues and reducing API calls, input tokens, and output tokens by 21%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. We release the code, prompts, and data at https://github.com/EffiSEAgent/EET.</description>

      <title>SSR: Safeguarding Staking Rewards by Defining and Detecting Logical Defects in DeFi Staking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) staking is one of the most prominent applications within the DeFi ecosystem, where DeFi projects enable users to stake tokens on the platform and reward participants with additional tokens. However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.</description>

      <title>RISE: Rule-Driven SQL Dialect Translation via Query Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating SQL dialects across different relational database management systems (RDBMSs) is crucial for migrating RDBMS-based applications to the cloud. Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.
  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively.</description>

      <title>AutoMonitor-Bench: Evaluating the Reliability of LLM-Based Misbehavior Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Native Software Engineering (SE 3.0): A Vision and a Challenge Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of AI-assisted software engineering (SE 2.0), powered by Foundation Models (FMs) and FM-powered coding assistants, has shown promise in improving developer productivity. However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-centric, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-centric conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</description>

      <title>Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06994v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application profiling is essential for software optimization tasks such as code layout and memory placement, where optimization decisions depend on program behavior. However, modern applications exhibit significant input-dependent variability, limiting the effectiveness of conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution. We present Phaedrus, a compiler-assisted deep learning framework that predicts dynamic program behavior across diverse execution instances, with a focus on dynamic function call prediction. These predicted call sequences are used to guide input-specific compiler optimizations, enabling code specialization without requiring program execution.
  Phaedrus introduces two complementary techniques. Application Behavior Synthesis (Dynamis) is a profile-less approach in which large language models infer dynamic behavior directly from source code and static compiler analysis, bypassing traditional profiling. Application Profile Generalization (Morpheus) employs generative models trained on compressed and augmented Whole Program Path (WPP) function profiles to predict application behavior for unseen inputs. Experimental results show that Phaedrus accurately identifies frequently executed and runtime-dominated hotspot functions, covering up to 85-99% of total execution time. Using these predictions, Phaedrus enables superior profile-guided optimizations, achieving an average performance improvement of 6% (upto 25%) and a binary size reduction of 5.19% (upto 19%), without executing the target program. Additionally, Phaedrus reduces WPP function profile sizes by up to $10^{7} \times $.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Bugs in LLM Inference Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model-specific inference engines (in short as \emph{LLM inference engines}) have become a fundamental component of modern AI infrastructure, enabling the deployment of LLM-powered applications (LLM apps) across cloud and local devices. Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, commonality, fix effort, fix strategies, and temporal evolution. Our findings reveal six bug symptom types and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers, along with general guidelines for developing LLM inference engines.</description>

Abstract: Conventional debugging techniques used in traditional software are similarly used when debugging video games. However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Requirements Prioritization in mHealth Applications: Insights from a Discrete Choice Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) applications are widely used for chronic disease management, but usability and accessibility challenges persist due to the diverse needs of users. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a personalized solution to enhance user experience, yet barriers to adoption remain. Understanding user preferences and trade-offs is essential to ensure widespread acceptance of adaptation designs. This study identifies key factors influencing user preferences and trade-offs in mHealth adaptation design. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted with 186 participants who have chronic diseases and use mHealth applications. Participants were asked to select preferred adaptation designs from choices featuring six attributes with varying levels. A mixed logit model was used to analyze preference heterogeneity and determine the factors most likely influencing adoption. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to explore differences by age, gender, health conditions, and coping mechanisms. Maintaining usability while ensuring controllability over adaptations, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes are key factors that facilitate the adoption of adaptive mHealth app designs. In contrast, frequently used functions and caregiver involvement can diminish the perceived value of such adaptations. This study employs a data-driven approach to quantify user preferences, identify key trade-offs, and reveal variations across demographic and behavioral subgroups through preference heterogeneity modeling. Furthermore, our results offer valuable guidance for developing future adaptive mHealth applications and lay the groundwork for continued exploration into requirements prioritization within the field of software engineering.</description>

      <title>Securing the AI Supply Chain: What Can We Learn From Developer-Reported Security Issues and Solutions of AI Projects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.</description>

      <title>From Laboratory to Real-World Applications: Benchmarking Agentic Code Reasoning at the Repository Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pragmatic reasoning is pervasive in human-human communication - it allows us to leverage shared knowledge and counterfactual reasoning in order to infer the intention of a conversational partner given their ambiguous or underspecified message. In human-computer communication, underspecified messages often represent a major challenge: for instance, translating natural language instructions into code is difficult when user instructions contain inherent ambiguities. In the present paper, we aim to scale up the pragmatic "Rational Speech Act" framework to naturalistic language-to-code problems, and propose a way of dealing with multiple meaning-equivalent instruction alternatives, an issue that does not arise in previous toy-scale problems. We evaluate our method, CodeRSA, with two recent LLMs (Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct) on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP). Our experimental results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. Qualitative analyses demonstrate that it exhibits the desired behavior for the right reasons. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into a naturalistic complex communication task, language-to-code generation, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs and emphasizing the importance of pragmatic reasoning in complex communication settings.</description>

      <title>LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</description>

      <title>ContractEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Contract-Satisfying Assertions in Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks measure functional correctness on well-formed inputs, as test cases are curated to satisfy input preconditions. This leaves a gap: generated programs may appear correct but fail to satisfy contracts -- assertion-level validity constraints for rejecting ill-formed inputs. We introduce ContractEval, a benchmark for evaluating contract-satisfying assertions in code generation, i.e., whether code rejects contract-violating inputs by triggering intended assertions. Built on HumanEval+ and MBPP+, ContractEval augments each task with contract-violation tests derived from reference assertions. We synthesize these via a neuro-symbolic pipeline: an LLM converts assertion clauses into constraints, and an SMT solver enumerates satisfiable violation combinations to generate inputs that violate selected clauses while satisfying the rest. Across five code LLMs, standard prompting yields 0% contract satisfaction, while adding a few contract-violation examples boosts contract satisfaction to 49--53% while maintaining pass@1 by 92% of the original. Our code is available at https://github.com/suhanmen/ContractEval.</description>
