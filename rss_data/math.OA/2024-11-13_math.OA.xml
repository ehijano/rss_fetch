      <title>The Talented Monoid of Higher-Rank Graphs with Applications to Kumjian-Pask Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a row-finite higher-rank $k$-graph $\Lambda$, we define a commutative monoid $T_\Lambda$ which is a higher-rank analogue of the talented monoid of a directed graph. The talented monoid $T_\Lambda$ is canonically a $\mathbb{Z}^k$-monoid with respect to the action of state shift. This monoid coincides with the positive cone of the graded Grothendieck group $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda))$ of the Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathsf{k}$. The aim of the paper is to investigate this $\mathbb{Z}^k$-monoid as a capable invariant for classification of Kumjian-Pask algebras.
  If $\mathbb{Z}^k$ acts freely on $T_\Lambda$ (i.e., if $T_\Lambda$ has no nonzero periodic element), then we show that the $k$-graph $\Lambda$ is aperiodic. The converse is also proved to be true provided $\Lambda$ has no sources and $T_\Lambda$ is atomic. Moreover in this case, we provide a talented monoid characterization for strongly aperiodic $k$-graphs. We prove that for a row-finite $k$-graph $\Lambda$ without sources, cofinality is equivalent to the simplicity of $T_\Lambda$ as a $\mathbb{Z}^k$-monoid. In view of this we provide a talented monoid criterion for the Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_R(\Lambda)$ of $\Lambda$ over a unital commutative ring $R$ to be graded basic ideal simple. We also describe the minimal left ideals of $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$ in terms of the aperiodic atoms of $T_\Lambda$ and thus obtain a monoid theoretic characterization for $Soc(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$) to be an essential ideal. These results help us to characterize semisimple Kumjian-Pask algebras through the lens of $T_\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Symmetrized pseudofunction algebras from $L^p$-representations and amenability of locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show via an application of techniques from complex interpolation theory how the $L^p$-pseudofunction algebras of a locally compact group $G$ can be understood as sitting between $L^1(G)$ and $C^*(G)$. Motivated by this, we collect and review various characterizations of group amenability connected to the $p$-pseudofunction algebra of Herz and generalize these to the symmetrized setting. Along the way, we describe the Banach space dual of the symmetrized pseudofuntion algebras on $G$ associated with representations on reflexive Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras of Thompson-like Groups from Cloning Systems II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of groups equipped with a $d$-ary cloning system and denote by $\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$ the resulting Thompson-like group. In previous work joint with Zaremsky, we obtained structural results concerning the group von Neumann algebra of $\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$, denoted by $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$. Under some natural assumptions on the $d$-ary cloning system, we proved that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor. With a few additional natural assumptions, we proved that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is, moreover, a McDuff factor. In this paper, we further analyze the structure of $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, in particular the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, where $F_d$ is the smallest of the Higman--Thompson groups. We prove that if the $d$-ary cloning system is ``diverse," then $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ satisfies the weak asymptotic homomorphism property. As a consequence, the inclusion is irreducible, which is a considerable improvement of our result that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor, and the inclusion is also singular. Then we look at examples of non-diverse $d$-ary cloning systems with respect to the weak asymptotic homomorphism property, singularity, and irreducibility. Then we finish the paper with some applications. We construct a machine which takes in an arbitrary group and finite group and produces an inclusion (both finite and infinite index) of type $\text{II}_1$ factors which is singular but without the weak asymptotic homomorphism property. Finally, using irreducibility of the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, our conditions for when $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a McDuff factor, and the fact that Higman-Thompson groups $F_d$ are character rigid (in the sense of Peterson), we prove that the groups $F_d$ are McDuff (in the sense of Deprez-Vaes).</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Williams' and Graded Equivalence Conjectures for small graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove what might have been expected: The Williams Conjecture in symbolic dynamics and Graded Morita Equivalence Conjecture for Leavitt/$C^*$-graph algebras hold for ``small graphs'', i.e., connected graphs with three vertices, no parallel edges, no sinks with no trivial hereditary and saturated subsets. Namely, two small graphs are shift equivalent if and only if they are strong shift equivalent if and only if their Leavitt/$C^*$-graph algebras are graded/equivariant Morita equivalent.</description>

      <title>Levi-Civita connection on the irreducible quantum flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify covariant metrics (in the sense of Beggs and Majid) on a class of quantum homogeneous spaces. In particular, our classification implies the existence of a unique (up to scalar) quantum symmetric covariant metric on the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi for the quantized irreducible flag manifolds. Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection for any real covariant metric for the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi. This generalizes Matassa's result for the quantum projective spaces.</description>
