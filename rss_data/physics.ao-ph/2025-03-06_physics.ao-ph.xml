      <title>Turbulence and energy dissipation from wave breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave breaking is a critical process in the upper ocean: an energy sink for the surface wave field and a source for turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer. We apply a novel multi-layer numerical solver resolving upper-ocean dynamics over scales from O(50cm) to O(1km), including a broad-banded wave field and wave breaking. The present numerical study isolates the effect of wave breaking and allows us to study the surface layer in wave-influenced and wave-breaking-dominated regimes. Following our previous work showing wave breaking statistics in agreement with field observations, we extend the analysis to underwater breaking-induced turbulence and related dissipation (in freely decaying conditions). We observe a rich field of vorticity resulting from the turbulence generation by breaking waves. We discuss the vertical profiles of dissipation rate which are compared with field observations, and propose an empirical universal shape function. Good agreement is found, further demonstrating that wave breaking can dominate turbulence generation in the near-surface layer. We examine the dissipation from different angles: the global dissipation of the wave field computed from the decaying wave field, the spectral dissipation from the fifth moment of breaking front distribution, and a turbulence dissipation estimated from the underwater strain rate tensor. Finally, we consider how these different estimates can be understood as part of a coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Generative assimilation and prediction for weather and climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have shown great success in predicting weather up to two weeks ahead, outperforming process-based benchmarks. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the prediction task, and do not incorporate the necessary data assimilation. Moreover, these models suffer from error accumulation in long roll-outs, limiting their applicability to seasonal predictions or climate projections. Here, we introduce Generative Assimilation and Prediction (GAP), a unified deep generative framework for assimilation and prediction of both weather and climate. By learning to quantify the probabilistic distribution of atmospheric states under observational, predictive, and external forcing constraints, GAP excels in a broad range of weather-climate related tasks, including data assimilation, seamless prediction, and climate simulation. In particular, GAP is competitive with state-of-the-art ensemble assimilation, probabilistic weather forecast and seasonal prediction, yields stable millennial simulations, and reproduces climate variability from daily to decadal time scales.</description>

      <title>Capturing methane in a barn environment: the CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project aims at developing a prototype for methane emissions capture in a barn environment. Methane has a higher global warming potential (GWP) with respect to CO2, and methane emissions of human origin contribute about 23% to global warming. Emissions from livestock farms play a non-negligible role, as a single cow is capable of emitting about 110 kg of methane in a year. Several projects have tried to mitigate the problem by intervening on animal feed: CH4rLiE, in contrast, proposes to act on the methane already produced and diffused in the air, using a specially developed recovery system. The idea arose from the expertise acquired in the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN, where special gas recuperation systems are being developed to extract CF4 from gaseous detectors' exhausted gas mixture. The project focuses on the study of gas adsorption by porous materials and on the development of a prototype system for methane capture, which will be installed in a real barn. This study is being supported by an initial phase of gas diffusion simulations and by a campaign of measurements of gas concentrations in different barn areas. CH4rLiE will also provide an opportunity to explore, for the first time, the feasibility of methane recovery from the farm environment without affecting the animals' feeding or living conditions. The social benefits are extremely interesting both in terms of developing and implementing low-impact farming production processes, but also in terms of recycling expensive or environmentally unfriendly gasses.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. With incorporated eleven-grid interpolation technique MARFA shows good performance in computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5*10E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>
