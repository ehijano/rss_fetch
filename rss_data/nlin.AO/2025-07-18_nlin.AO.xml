      <title>Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Functionally Differentiated Structures via Mutual Information Optimization in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional differentiation in the brain emerges as distinct regions specialize and is key to understanding brain function as a complex system. Previous research has modeled this process using artificial neural networks with specific constraints. Here, we propose a novel approach that induces functional differentiation in recurrent neural networks by minimizing mutual information between neural subgroups via mutual information neural estimation. We apply our method to a 2-bit working memory task and a chaotic signal separation task involving Lorenz and R\"ossler time series. Analysis of network performance, correlation patterns, and weight matrices reveals that mutual information minimization yields high task performance alongside clear functional modularity and moderate structural modularity. Importantly, our results show that functional differentiation, which is measured through correlation structures, emerges earlier than structural modularity defined by synaptic weights. This suggests that functional specialization precedes and probably drives structural reorganization within developing neural networks. Our findings provide new insights into how information-theoretic principles may govern the emergence of specialized functions and modular structures during artificial and biological brain development.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>A biophysical approach to the design of networks of communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the growth dynamics of the protist \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, we employ a formalism that describes adaptive, incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flows on channel networks to identify graphs connecting different nodes within Euclidean space. These graphs are either suboptimal or optimal with respect to their length. Occasionally, we derive graph tree configurations that are topologically equivalent to Steiner trees. This methodology can be utilised to assist in making decisions regarding the design of communication networks, such as fibre webs, motorways, or railway networks. As a demonstration of the practicality of this approach, we explicitly apply this framework to the Portuguese railway network.</description>
