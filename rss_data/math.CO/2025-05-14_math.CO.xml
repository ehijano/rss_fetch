      <title>Defects in weighted graphs and Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring. In \cite{KK_2025(1)}, the authors introduced $R$-weighted graphs as a tool for studying commutators in groups and Lie algebras. These graphs are equivalent to a system of balance equations, and their consistent labelings correspond to solutions of this system of balance equations. In this article, we apply these ideas in the case when $R$ is a field $F$. We focus on $F$-weighted graphs with four vertices and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of consistent labelings on them. A notion of defects in weighted graphs is introduced for this purpose. We prove that defects in weighted graphs prevent Lie brackets from being surjective onto its derived Lie subalgebra. Similarly, these defects prevent certain elements in the commutator subgroup of a nilpotent group of class $2$ from being a commutator. As an application of our techniques, we prove that for a Lie algebra $L$ whose dimension over $F$ is at most countable and the dimension of its derived subalgebra $L'$ is at most $3$, the Lie bracket is surjective onto $L'$. We provide a counterexample when $\dim(L') = 4$. We also characterize commutators among $L$' for the Lie algebras $L$ with $\dim(L/Z(L))\leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Real state transfer on edge perturbed graphs with generalised clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs having generalised clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix associated with a weighted graph. This approach establishes a unified framework for constructing new graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer by leveraging known examples with this property. The results presented herein generalise several previously established findings on real state transfer. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer with respect to each of the aforementioned matrices, between the same pair states and at the same transfer time, despite the fact that these graphs are not regular.</description>

      <title>A decomposition structure of resonance graphs that are daisy cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in [\emph{Discrete Appl. Math.} {\bf 366} (2025) 75--85] that the resonance graph of a plane elementary bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if $G$ is peripherally 2-colorable. Let $G$ be a peripherally 2-colorable graph and $R(G)$ be its resonance graph. We provide a decomposition structure of $R(G)$ with respect to an arbitrary finite face of $G$ together with a proper labelling for the vertex set of $R(G)$. An algorithm is obtained to generate a proper labelling for all perfect matchings of $G$ which induces an isometric embedding of $R(G)$ as a daisy cube into an $n$-dimensional hypercube, where $n$ is the isometric dimension of $R(G)$. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to generate such a proper labelling for all perfect matchings of any plane weakly elementary bipartite graph whose each elementary component with more than two vertices is peripherally 2-colorable. We also compare two binary codings for all perfect matchings of $G$ which induces distinct structures on $R(G)$: one as a daisy cube and the other as a finite distributive, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give algebraic relations and determinant vanishing equalities that hold for the entries of a single Heronian diamond of a Heronian frieze arising from a cyclic $n$-gon. We also give algebraic relations that hold between entries of multiple adjacent diamonds of such a frieze. Furthermore, we define a plane Heronian frieze, and establish some more determinant vanishing equalities for the entries of a plane Heronian frieze arising from a cyclic $n$-gon, where $n$ is a positive integer divisible by $4$.</description>

      <title>The polytope of all $q$-rank functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $q$-rank function is a real-valued function defined on the subspace lattice that is non-negative, upper bounded by the dimension function, non-drecreasing, and satisfies the submodularity law. Each such function corresponds to the rank function of a $q$-polymatroid. In this paper, we identify these functions with points in a polytope. We show that this polytope contains no interior lattice points, implying that the points corresponding to $q$-matroids are among its vertices. We investigate several properties of convex combinations of two lattice points in this polytope, particularly in terms of independence, flats, and cyclic flats. Special attention is given to the convex combinations of paving and uniform $q$-matroids.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of List Colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a proper (list) colouring of a graph $G$, a recolouring step changes the colour at a single vertex to another colour (in its list) that is currently unused on its neighbours, hence maintaining a proper colouring. Suppose that each vertex $v$ has its own private list $L(v)$ of allowed colours such that $|L(v)|\ge \mbox{deg}(v)+1$. We prove that if $G$ is connected and its maximum degree $\Delta$ is at least $3$, then for any two proper $L$-colourings in which at least one vertex can be recoloured, one can be transformed to the other by a sequence of $O(|V(G)|^2)$ recolouring steps. We also show that reducing the list-size of a single vertex $w$ to $\mbox{deg}(w)$ can lead to situations where the space of proper $L$-colourings is `shattered'. Our results can be interpreted as showing a sharp phase transition in the Glauber dynamics of proper $L$-colourings of graphs. This constitutes a `local' strengthening and generalisation of a result of Feghali, Johnson, and Paulusma, which considered the situation where the lists are all identical to $\{1,\ldots,\Delta+1\}$.</description>

      <title>Signed Partitions and Rogers-Ramanujan type Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: George Andrews [\emph{Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 2007, 561--573] introduced the idea of a \emph{signed partiton} of an integer; similar to an ordinary integer partitions, but where some of the parts could be negative. Further, Andrews reinterpreted the classical G\"ollnitz--Gordon partition identities in terms of signed partitions. In the present work, we provide interpretations of the sum sides of Rogers--Ramanujan type identities, including a new signed partition interpretation of the G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities, different from that of Andrews. Both analytic and bijective proofs are presented.</description>

      <title>On the existence of minimally tough graphs having large minimum degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kriesel conjectured that every minimally $1$-tough graph has a vertex with degree precisely $2$. Katona and Varga (2018) proposed a generalized version of this conjecture which says that every minimally $t$-tough graph has a vertex with degree precisely $\lceil 2t\rceil$, where $t$ is a positive real number. This conjecture has been recently verified for several families of graphs. For example, Ma, Hu, and Yang (2023) confirmed it for claw-free minimally $3/2$-tough graphs. Recently, Zheng and Sun (2024) disproved this conjecture by constructing a family of $4$-regular graphs with toughness approaching to $1$.
  In this paper, we disprove this conjecture for planar graphs and their line graphs. In particular, we construct an infinite family of minimally $t$-tough non-regular claw-free graphs with minimum degree close to thrice their toughness. This construction not only disproves a renewed version of Generalized Kriesel's Conjecture on non-regular graphs proposed by Zheng and Sun (2024), it also gives a supplement to a result due to Ma, Hu, and Yang (2023) who proved that every minimally $t$-tough claw-free graph with $t\ge 2$ has a vertex of degree at most $3t+ \lceil (t-5)/3\rceil$. Moreover, we conjecture that there is not a fixed constant $c$ such that every minimally $t$-tough graph has minimum degree at most $\lceil c t \rceil$.</description>

      <title>Local Distance Antimagic Labeling of Neighborhood Balanced Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G = (V, E) be a graph of order n without isolated vertices. A bijection f from vertex set of G to the set of integers from 1 to n is called a local distance antimagic labeling, if w(u) is not equal to w(v) for every edge uv of G, where w(u) is sum of labels of vertices adjacent to u. The local distance antimagic chromatic number xld(G) is defined to be the minimum number of colors taken over all colorings of G induced by local distance antimagic labelings of G. In this article, we study the local distance antimagic labeling of neighborhood balanced colored graphs.</description>

      <title>Contractible Non-Edges in 3-Connected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a pair of non-adjacent vertices in G a non-edge. Contraction of a non-edge {u, v} in G is the replacement of u and v with a single vertex z and then making all the vertices that are adjacent to u or v adjacent to z. A non-edge {u, v} is said to be contractible in a k-connected graph G, if the resulting graph after its contraction remains k-connected. Tsz Lung Chan characterized all 3-connected graphs (finite or infinite) that does not contain any contractible non-edges in 2019, and posed the problem of characterizing all 3-connected graphs that contain exactly one contractible non-edge. In this paper, we solve this problem.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado Theorem in $\ell_2$-Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree squared sum ${\rm co}_2(\cal F)$ of a family (hypergraph) $\cal F \subseteq \binom{[n]} k$ is defined to be the sum of codegrees squared $d(E)^2$ over all $E\in \binom{[n]}{k-1}$, where $d(E)=|\{F\in \cal F: E\subseteq F\}|$. Given a family of $k$-uniform families $\mathscr H$, Balogh, Clemen and Lidick\'y recently introduced the problem to determine the maximum codegree squared sum ${\rm co}_2(\cal F)$ over all $\mathscr H$-free $\cal F$. In the present paper, we consider the families which has as forbidden configurations all pairs of sets with intersection sizes less than $t$,
  that is, the well-known $t$-intersecting families. We prove the following Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado Theorem in $\ell_2$-norm, which confirms a conjecture of Brooks and Linz.
  Let $t,k,n$ be positive integers such that $t\leq k\leq n$. If a family $\mathcal F\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ is $t$-intersecting, then for $n\ge (t+1)(k-t+1)$, we have \[{\rm co}_2(\cal F)\le {\binom{n-t}{k-t}}(t+(n-k+1)(k-t)),\] equality holds if and only if $\mathcal{F}=\{F\in {\binom{[n]}{k}}: T\subset F\}$ for some $t$-subset $T$ of $[n]$.
  In addition, we prove a Frankl--Hilton--Milner Theorem in $\ell_2$-norm for $t\ge 2$, and a generalized Tur\'an result, i.e., we determine the maximum number of copies of tight path of length 2 in $t$-intersecting families.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bijective proof of a family of $q$-binomial identities -- including Stanley's identity -- each equivalent to the $q$-Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz identity. Our proof is far shorter than those previously known and is the first in which $q$-binomial coefficients are interpreted as counting subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces. As a corollary, we obtain a new multiplication rule for quantum binomial coefficients and hence a new presentation of Lusztig's integral form $U_{\mathbb{Z}[q, q^{-1}]}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of the Cartan subalgebra of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the vertical and horizontal insertion encodings for Cayley permutations which naturally generalise the insertion encoding for permutations. In both cases, we fully classify the Cayley permutation classes for which these languages are regular, and provide an algorithm for computing the rational generating functions. We use our algorithm to solve an open problem of Cerbai by enumerating the hare pop-stack sortable Cayley permutations.</description>

      <title>On lattice tilings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by limited magnitude error balls $\mathcal{B}(n,2,k_{1},k_{2})$ with $k_1&gt;k_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice tilings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by limited-magnitude error balls correspond to linear perfect codes under such error models and play a crucial role in flash memory applications. In this work, we establish three main results. First, we fully determine the existence of lattice tilings by $\mathcal{B}(n,2,3,0)$ in all dimensions $n$. Second, we completely resolve the case $k_1=k_2+1$. Finally, we prove that for any integers $k_1&gt;k_2\ge0$ where $k_1+k_2+1$ is composite, no lattice tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by the error ball $\mathcal{B}(n,2,k_1,k_2)$ exists for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient SDA: Graph Theory and Cooperative Control in Distributed Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) involves the detection, tracking, and characterization of space objects through the fusion of data across the space environment. As SDA advances beyond localized or operator-specific capabilities, there is a growing reliance on in-domain space assets for real-time, distributed sensing and decision-making. This paper investigates the potential of on-orbit collaboration by enabling data sharing among heterogeneous satellites as actuators within a single orbital regime. Using graph-theoretic constructs, we define regions of spatial responsibility via Voronoi tessellations and model communication pathways between actuators using Delaunay triangulation. We apply this framework independently to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and analyze each to quantify structural properties relevant to efficient communication, cooperative control, and synchronization for SDA operations with the growth in deployments of space assets.</description>

      <title>Untouchable sets of size $2q \pm 1$ in $PG(2,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An untouchable set in a projective plane is a set of points such that no line of the plane meets the set in exactly one point. Recently, H\'eger and Nagy (Avoiding Secants of Given Size in Finite Projective Planes, J. Combin. Des. 33:83--93, 2024.) provided a generalization of untouchable sets to $k$-avoiding sets, and addressed the issue of the spectrum of sizes that such sets can attain in finite planes. Specific to the untouchable set case, the authors state as an open question the existence of untouchable sets of size $2q-1$ and $2q+1$. We answer this question in the affirmative for Desarguesian planes of even order, and provide a construction of untouchable sets of size $2q+1$ in $PG(2,q)$ for $q \equiv 3\pmod{4}$.</description>

      <title>Small hitting sets for longest paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an old question of Gallai (1966) on the intersection of longest paths in a graph and the well-known conjectures of Lov\'{a}sz (1969) and Thomassen (1978) on the maximum length of paths and cycles in vertex-transitive graphs, we present improved bounds for the parameters $\mathrm{lpt}(G)$ and $\mathrm{lct}(G)$, defined as the minimum size of a set of vertices in a graph $G$ hitting all longest paths (cycles, respectively). First, we show that every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$, and $\mathrm{lct}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$ if $G$ is additionally $2$-connected. This improves a sequence of earlier bounds for these problems, with the previous state of the art being $O(n^{2/3})$. Second, we show that every connected graph $G$ satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le O(\ell^{5/9})$, where $\ell$ denotes the maximum length of a path in $G$. As an immediate application of this latter bound, we present further progress towards Lov\'{a}sz conjecture: We show that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $n$ contains a path of length $\Omega(n^{9/14})$. This improves the previous best bound of the form $\Omega(n^{13/21})$. Interestingly, our proofs make use of several concepts and results from structural graph theory, such as a result of Robertson and Seymour (1990) on transactions in societies and Tutte's $2$-separator theorem.</description>

      <title>Impartial removing games on grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of the vertex set of a graph is geodetically convex if it contains every vertex on any shortest path between two elements of the subset. The convex hull of a set of vertices is the smallest convex set containing the set. We study two games in which two players take turns selecting vertices of a graph until the convex hull of the remaining unselected vertices is too small. The last player to move is the winner. The achievement game ends when the convex hull of the unselected vertices does not contain every vertex in the graph. In the avoidance game, the convex hull of the remaining vertices must contain every vertex. We determine the nim-number of these games for the family of grid graphs. We also provide some results for lattice graphs. Key tools in this analysis are delayed gamegraphs, option preserving maps, and case analysis diagrams.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a certain remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of Cohn's four hexatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading and extended harmony, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show that analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability Relations induced by Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homomorphism indistinguishability is a way of characterising many natural equivalence relations on graphs. Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Examples of such equivalence relations include isomorphism and cospectrality, as well as equivalence with respect to many formal logics. Quantum groups are a generalisation of topological groups that describe "non-commutative symmetries" and, inter alia, have applications in quantum information theory. An important subclass are the easy quantum groups, which enjoy a combinatorial characterisation and have been fully classified by Raum and Weber. A recent connection between these seemingly distant concepts was made by Man\v{c}inska and Roberson, who showed that quantum isomorphism, a relaxation of classical isomorphism that can be phrased in terms of the quantum symmetric group, is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over the class of planar graphs. We generalise Man\v{c}inska and Roberson's result to all orthogonal easy quantum groups. We obtain for each orthogonal easy quantum group a graph isomorphism relaxation $\approx$ and a graph class $\mathcal{F}$, such that homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ coincides with $\approx$. Our results include a full classification of the $(0, 0)$-intertwiners of the graph-theoretic quantum group obtained by adding the adjacency matrix of a graph to the intertwiners of an orthogonal easy quantum group.</description>

      <title>Majorization and Inequalities among Complete Homogenous Symmetric Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive braid $\beta \in \mathrm{Br}^{+}_{k}$, we consider the braid variety $X(\beta)$. We define a family of open sets $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ in $X(\beta)$, where $w \in S_k$ is a permutation and $r$ is a positive integer no greater than the length of $\beta$. For fixed $r$, the sets $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ form an open cover of $X(\beta)$. We conjecture that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ is given by the nonvanishing of some cluster variables in a single cluster for the cluster structure on $\mathbb{C}[X(\beta)]$ and that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ admits a cluster structure given by freezing these variables. Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ is always isomorphic to the product of two braid varieties, and we conjecture that this isomorphism is quasi-cluster. In some important special cases, we are able to prove our conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized regular representations of the wreath product of a compact group with the infinite symmetric group. The characters of these representations are determined by probability measures on families of partitions called the $z$-measures for the wreath product of a compact group with the symmetric group in the present paper. Our main result is an explicit formula for these $z$-measures which holds true for an arbitrary compact group. The result enables us to describe the spectral measures of the generalized regular representations of big wreath products.</description>

      <title>On the hull-variation problem of equivalent vector rank metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of a linear code with its dual is called the hull of the code. It is known that, for classical linear codes under the Hamming metric, the dimension of the hull can be reduced up to equivalence. This phenomenon leads to the so-called hull-variation problem formulated by Hao Chen in 2023. In this paper, we consider the analogous problem for vector rank metric codes, along with their associated matrix codes and extended block codes. We also discuss the implications in the context of $(q,m)$-polymatroids.</description>

      <title>Properties of LCM Lattices of Monomial Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LCM lattices were introduced by Gasharov, Peeva, and Welker as a way to study minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals. All LCM lattices are atomic and all atomic lattices arise as the LCM lattice of some monomial ideal. We systematically study other lattice properties of LCM lattices. For lattices associated to the edge ideal of a graph, we completely characterize the many standard lattice properties in terms of the associated graphs: Boolean, modular, upper semimodular, lower semimodular, supersolvable, coatomic, and complemented; edge ideals with graded LCM lattices were previously characterized by Nevo and Peeva as those associated to gap-free graphs. Such a characterization for arbitrary monomial ideals appears to be out of reach. However, we prove the Cohen-Macaulayness of minimal monomial ideals associated to modular lattices. We also prove separate necessary and sufficient lattice conditions for when the projective dimension of a monomial ideal matches the height of its LCM lattice.</description>

      <title>The List Square Coloring Conjecture fails for bipartite planar graphs and their line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kostochka and Woodall (2001) conjectured that the square of every graph has the same chromatic number and list chromatic number. In 2015 Kim and Park disproved this conjecture for non-bipartite and bipartite graphs. It was asked by several authors whether this conjecture holds for bipartite graphs with small degrees, claw-free graphs, or line graphs. In this paper, we introduce several kinds of counterexamples to this conjecture to solve three open problems posed by Kim and Park~(2015), Kim, Kwon, and Park~(2015), and Dai, Wang, Yang, and Yu~(2018). In particular, we disprove a planar version of this conjecture proposed by Havet, Heuvel, McDiarmid, and Reed (2017).
  This conjecture was originally proposed to make a stronger version of the List Total Coloring Conjecture. In order to make a revised version, it remains to decide whether this conjecture holds for bipartite graphs $G$ by imposing a lower bound on the chromatic number of the square graph $G^2$ in terms of its maximum degree as the condition $\chi(G^2) \ge \frac{1}{2} \Delta(G^2)+1$ (or by adding an upper bound on the number of colors used in lists for a weaker version). To support this version, we will show that the bipartite condition cannot be dropped even by increasing the lower bound arbitrarily.
  Finally, we investigate non-choosable graphs with bounded maximum degree in bipartite or planar graphs. Consequently, we improve several graph constructions due to Erd\H os, Rubin, and Taylor~(1980), Bessy, Havet, and Palaysi (2002), Voigt (1993), Mirzakhani (1996), and Glebov, Kostochka, and Tashkinov (2005) in terms of maximum degree or order. In addition, we characterize edge-minimal $3$-chromatic non-$3$-choosable (resp. $4$-chromatic non-$4$-choosable) graphs of order at most $9$ (resp. $11$) and settle a question posed by Nelsen~(2019).</description>

      <title>Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric polynomial functions are fundamental questions in mathematics and have various applications in science and engineering. This paper investigates a beautiful and inspiring conjecture, proposed by Cuttler, Greene and Skandera in 2011, on inequalities among the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial function $H_{n,\lambda}$: It states that the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$ implies majorization order $\lambda\preceq\mu$. The conjecture is a close analogy with other known results on Muirhead-type inequalities. In 2021, Heaton and Shankar disproved the conjecture by showing a counterexample for number of variables $n=3$ and degree $d=8$. They then asked whether the conjecture is true when $n$ is sufficiently large. In this paper, we show, by a family of counter-examples, that the conjecture does not hold for any $n$ and any $d$ as long as $n\geq2$ and $d\geq8$. Based on the insights gained from the counter-examples, we propose a new conjecture for the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new poset structure on Dyck paths where the covering relation is a particular case of the relation inducing the Tamari lattice. We prove that the transitive closure of this relation endows Dyck paths with a lattice structure. We provide a trivariate generating function counting the number of Dyck paths with respect to the semilength, the numbers of outgoing and incoming edges in the Hasse diagram. We deduce the numbers of coverings, meet and join irreducible elements. As a byproduct, we present a new involution on Dyck paths that transports the bistatistic of the numbers of outgoing and incoming edges into its reverse. Finally, we give a generating function for the number of intervals, and we compare this number with the number of intervals in the Tamari lattice.</description>

      <title>Inversion Sets and Quotient Root Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is a recursive description of all decompositions \[ \Delta^+ = \Phi_1 \sqcup \Phi_2 \sqcup \dots \sqcup \Phi_k \] of the positive roots $\Delta^+$ of an arbitrary root system $\Delta$ into a disjoint union of inversion sets. Such decompositions play a central role in geometric invariant theory (GIT) in connection with studying the Littlewood-Richardson cone and related problems. This work can be considered as a continuation of the work of Dewji, Dimitrov, McCabe, Roth, Wehlau, and Wilson in which similar questions were studied for root systems of type $\mathbb{A}$. Their methods relied on properties of permutations and are not transferable to an arbitrary root system.
  In order to develop a type-independent approach, we go beyond root systems and consider quotient root systems (QRSs for short). We study subsets of positive roots in an arbitrary QRS $R$. We prove that every $\Phi \subseteq R^+$ can be represented in a canonical way as an inflation and develop methods to study recursively properties of such subsets. We extend the notion of an inversion to subsets of any QRS, i.e., beyond the case where a Weyl group is associated with $R$. If $\Phi \subseteq R^+$ is an inversion set, we introduce a graph $\text{G}(\Phi)$ and endow the set Comp$(\Phi)$ of connected components of $\text{G}(\Phi)$ with a partial addition. The resulting monoid-like structure (Comp$(\Phi),+)$ is a further generalization of root systems beyond QRSs. We study in detail the properties of (Comp$(\Phi),+)$ and their applications to studying the properties of $\Phi$. In particular, we investigate the relationship between $\Phi$ being primitive and $\Phi$ being irreducible. Apart from describing recursively all decompositions of $\Delta^+$ into the disjoint union of inversion sets, we provide applications to GIT and derive enumerative results which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Matthew Kwan and Yuval Wigderson showed that for an infinite family of graphs, the Lov\'asz number gives an upper bound of $O(n^{3/4})$ for the size of an independent set (where $n$ is the number of vertices), while the weighted inertia bound cannot do better than $\Omega(n)$. Here we point out that there is an infinite family of graphs for which the Lov\'asz number is $\Omega(n^{3/4})$, while the unweighted inertia bound is $O(n^{1/2})$.</description>

Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>Variants of Conway Checkers and k-nacci Jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway Checkers is a game played with a checker placed in each square of the lower half of an infinite checkerboard. Pieces move by jumping over an adjacent checker, removing the checker jumped over. Conway showed that it is not possible to reach row 5 in finitely many moves by weighting each cell in the board by powers of the golden ratio such that no move increases the total weight. Other authors have considered the game played on many different boards, including generalising the standard game to higher dimensions. We work on a board of arbitrary dimension, where we allow a cell to hold multiple checkers and begin with m checkers on each cell. We derive an upper bound and a constructive lower bound on the height that can be reached, such that the upper bound almost never fails to be equal to the lower bound. We also consider the more general case where instead of jumping over 1 checker, each checker moves by jumping over k checkers, and again show the maximum height reachable lies within bounds that are almost always equal.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial invariants of finite metric spaces and the Wasserstein arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Vershik proposed a new combinatorial invariant of metric spaces given by a class of polytopes that arise in the theory of optimal transport and are called ``Wasserstein polytopes'' or ``Kantorovich-Rubinstein polytopes'' in the literature. Answering a question posed by Vershik, we describe the stratification of the metric cone induced by the combinatorial type of these polytopes through a hyperplane arrangement. Moreover, we study its relationships with the stratification by combinatorial type of the injective hull (i.e., the tight span) and, in particular, with certain types of metrics arising in phylogenetic analysis. We also compute enumerative invariants in the case of metrics on up to six points.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. According to Tur\'{a}n's theorem, if $G$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, then $m \leq |E(T(n, r))|,$ where $T(n, r)$ denotes the Tur\'{a}n graph on $n$ vertices with a maximum clique of order $r$. A limitation of this statement is that it does not give an expression in terms of $n$ and $r$. A widely used version of Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that for an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph, $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r} \right\rfloor.$ Though this bound is often more convenient, it is not the same as the original statement. In particular, the class of extremal graphs for this bound, say $\mathcal{S}$, is a proper subset of the set of Tur\'{a}n graphs. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\right\rfloor\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound. Interestingly, this class contains two extra non-Tur\'{a}n graphs other than the graphs in $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular graphs in hyperbolic quadrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ be a hyperbolic quadric of $\PG(2n+1,q)$. Fix a generator $\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\cG_n$ as the graph with vertex set the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\setminus \Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they either span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ meeting $\Pi$ non-trivially. Then such a construction defines a strongly regular graph, which is the complement of a (non-induced) subgraph of the collinearity graph of $Q^+(2n+1,q)$. In this paper, we directly compute the parameters of $\cG_n$, which is cospectral, when $q=2$, to the tangent graph $NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but it is non-isomorphic for $n\geq3$. We also prove the non-isomorphism by analyzing the case of the quadric $Q^+(7,2)$.</description>

      <title>The Kelley--Meka bounds for sets free of three-term arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained exposition of the recent remarkable result of Kelley and Meka: if $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ has no non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions then $\lvert A\rvert \leq \exp(-c(\log N)^{1/12})N$ for some constant $c&gt;0$.
  Although our proof is identical to that of Kelley and Meka in all of the main ideas, we also incorporate some minor simplifications relating to Bohr sets. This eases some of the technical difficulties tackled by Kelley and Meka and widens the scope of their method. As a consequence, we improve the lower bounds for finding long arithmetic progressions in $A+A+A$, where $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$.</description>

      <title>The next gap in the subrank of 3-tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works of Costa-Dalai, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, and Bri\"et-Christandl-Leigh-Shpilka-Zuiddam have investigated notions of discreteness and gaps in the possible values that asymptotic tensor ranks can take. In particular, it was shown that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, or at least 2 (over any field), and that the set of possible values of these parameters is discrete (in several regimes). We determine exactly the next gap, showing that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, equal to 2, or at least 2.68.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new branching rule from the general linear group $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to the symplectic group $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ by establishing a simple algorithm which gives rise to a bijection from the set of semistandard tableaux of a fixed shape to a disjoint union of several copies of sets of symplectic tableaux of various shapes. The algorithm arises from representation theory of a quantum symmetric pair of type $A\mathrm{II}_{2n-1}$, which is a $q$-analogue of the classical symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}))$.</description>

      <title>The birational geometry of Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that all degenerations of the complex projective plane into a surface with only quotient singularities are controlled by the positive integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ of the Markov equation $$x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz.$$ It turns out that these degenerations are all connected through finite sequences of other simpler degenerations by means of birational geometry. In this paper, we explicitly describe these birational sequences and show how they are bridged among all Markov solutions. For a given Markov triple $(a,b,c)$, the number of birational modifications depends on the number of branches that it needs to cross in the Markov tree to reach the Fibonacci branch. We show that each of these branches corresponds exactly to a Mori train of the flipping universal family of a particular cyclic quotient singularity defined by $(a,b,c)$. As a byproduct, we obtain new numerical/combinatorial data for each Markov number, and new connections with the Markov conjecture (Frobenius Uniqueness Conjecture), which rely on Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions of Wahl singularities.</description>

      <title>On Separating Path and Tree Systems in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of separating systems of vertex sets of graphs. A separating system of a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that for any pair of distinct elements in $X$, there exists a set in the separating system that contains exactly one of the two elements. A separating system of the vertex set of a graph $G$ is called a vertex-separating path (tree) system of $G$ if the elements of the separating system are paths (trees) in the graph $G$. In this paper, we focus on the size of the smallest vertex-separating path (tree) system for different types of graphs, including trees, grids, and maximal outerplanar graphs.</description>
