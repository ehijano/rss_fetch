      <title>A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>FashionDPO:Fine-tune Fashion Outfit Generation Model using Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized outfit generation aims to construct a set of compatible and personalized fashion items as an outfit. Recently, generative AI models have received widespread attention, as they can generate fashion items for users to complete an incomplete outfit or create a complete outfit. However, they have limitations in terms of lacking diversity and relying on the supervised learning paradigm. Recognizing this gap, we propose a novel framework FashionDPO, which fine-tunes the fashion outfit generation model using direct preference optimization. This framework aims to provide a general fine-tuning approach to fashion generative models, refining a pre-trained fashion outfit generation model using automatically generated feedback, without the need to design a task-specific reward function. To make sure that the feedback is comprehensive and objective, we design a multi-expert feedback generation module which covers three evaluation perspectives, \ie quality, compatibility and personalization. Experiments on two established datasets, \ie iFashion and Polyvore-U, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the model's ability to align with users' personalized preferences while adhering to fashion compatibility principles. Our code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Yzcreator/FashionDPO.</description>

      <title>SmartFreeEdit: Mask-Free Spatial-Aware Image Editing with Complex Instruction Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be available at https://github.com/smileformylove/SmartFreeEdit.</description>

      <title>Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction for Effective Invisible Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world web content.

      <title>HiScene: Creating Hierarchical 3D Scenes with Isometric View Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and computer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object categories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.</description>

      <title>SemCORE: A Semantic-Enhanced Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval Framework with MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research, focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image retrieval.</description>

      <title>Scene-Text Grounding for Text-Based Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decisionmaking and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study Grounded TextVideoQA by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scenetext recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, e.g., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset ViTXT-GQA which features 52K scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2K temporal segments related to 2K questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition. To advance the research of Grounded TextVideoQA, our dataset and code are at https://github.com/zhousheng97/ViTXT-GQA.git</description>

      <title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fake News Video Explanation: Dataset, Analysis and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fake news videos are difficult to interpret because they require comprehensive consideration of the correlation and consistency between multiple modes. Existing methods deal with fake news videos as a classification problem, but it's not clear why news videos are identified as fake. Without proper explanation, the end user may not understand the underlying meaning of the falsehood. Therefore, we propose a new problem - Fake news video Explanation (FNVE) - given a multimodal news post containing a video and title, our goal is to generate natural language explanations to reveal the falsity of the news video. To that end, we developed FakeVE, a new dataset of 2,672 fake news video posts that can definitively explain four real-life fake news video aspects. In order to understand the characteristics of fake news video explanation, we conducted an exploratory analysis of FakeVE from different perspectives. In addition, we propose a Multimodal Relation Graph Transformer (MRGT) based on the architecture of multimodal Transformer to benchmark FakeVE. The empirical results show that the results of the various benchmarks (adopted by FakeVE) are convincing and provide a detailed analysis of the differences in explanation generation of the benchmark models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.</description>

      <title>Why We Feel: Breaking Boundaries in Emotional Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing emotion analysis emphasizes which emotion arises (e.g., happy, sad, angry) but neglects the deeper why. We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Self-Ask (CFSA) annotation pipeline, which guides Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through iterative question-answer rounds to yield high-quality labels at scale. Extensive evaluations on open-source and proprietary large language models under four experimental settings reveal consistent performance gaps-especially for more intricate scenarios-underscoring EI's potential to enrich empathetic, context-aware AI applications. Our benchmark and methods are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lum1104/EIBench, offering a foundation for advanced multimodal causal analysis and next-generation affective computing.</description>
