      <title>Dy-mer: An Explainable DNA Sequence Representation Scheme using Sparse Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA sequences encode vital genetic and biological information, yet these unfixed-length sequences cannot serve as the input of common data mining algorithms. Hence, various representation schemes have been developed to transform DNA sequences into fixed-length numerical representations. However, these schemes face difficulties in learning high-quality representations due to the complexity and sparsity of DNA data. Additionally, DNA sequences are inherently noisy because of mutations. While several schemes have been proposed for their effectiveness, they often lack semantic structure, making it difficult for biologists to validate and leverage the results. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dy-mer}, an explainable and robust DNA representation scheme based on sparse recovery. Leveraging the underlying semantic structure of DNA, we modify the traditional sparse recovery to capture recurring patterns indicative of biological functions by representing frequent K-mers as basis vectors and reconstructing each DNA sequence through simple concatenation. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{Dy-mer} achieves state-of-the-art performance in DNA promoter classification, yielding a remarkable \textbf{13\%} increase in accuracy. Moreover, its inherent explainability facilitates DNA clustering and motif detection, enhancing its utility in biological research.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</description>

      <title>Semantically Rich Local Dataset Generation for Explainable AI in Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black box deep learning models trained on genomic sequences excel at predicting the outcomes of different gene regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, interpreting these models may provide novel insights into the underlying biology, supporting downstream biomedical applications. Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA.
  We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a ~30% improvement over the baseline.</description>
