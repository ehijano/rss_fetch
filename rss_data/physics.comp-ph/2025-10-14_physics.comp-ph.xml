      <title>Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$ using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$ substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for fabricating uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals.</description>

      <title>CuPyMag: GPU-Accelerated Finite-Element Micromagnetics with Magnetostriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CuPyMag, an open-source, Python-based framework for large-scale micromagnetic simulations with magnetostriction. CuPyMag solves micromagnetics with finite elements in a GPU-resident workflow in which key operations, such as right-hand-side assembly, spatial derivatives, and volume averages, are tensorized using CuPy's BLAS-accelerated backend. Benchmark tests show that the GPU solvers in CuPyMag achieve a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the CPU codes. Its runtime grows linearly/sublinearly with problem size, demonstrating high efficiency. Additionally, CuPyMag uses the Gauss-Seidel projection method for time integration, which not only allows stable time steps (up to 11 ps) but also solves each governing equation with only 1-3 conjugate-gradient iterations without preconditioning. CuPyMag accounts for magnetoelastic coupling and far-field effects arising from the boundary of the magnetic body, both of which play an important role in magnetization reversal in the presence of local defects. CuPyMag solves these computationally intensive multiphysics simulations with a high-resolution mesh (up to 3M nodes) in under three hours on an NVIDIA H200 GPU. This acceleration enables micromagnetic simulations with non-trivial defect geometries and resolves nanoscale magnetic structures. It expands the scope of micromagnetic simulations towards realistic, large-scale problems that can guide experiments. More broadly, CuPyMag is developed using widely adopted Python libraries, which provide cross-platform compatibility, ease of installation, and accessibility for adaptations to diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Random State Approach to Quantum Computation of Electronic-Structure Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>ChemGen: Code Generation for Multispecies Chemical Kinetics in Computational Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ChemGen, a software package that uses code generation to integrate multispecies thermodynamics and chemical kinetics into C+-based computational physics codes. ChemGen aims to make chemical kinetics more accessible in existing simulation frameworks and help bridge the gap between combustion modeling and computational physics. The package employs the concept of decorators which enable flexible C++ code generation to target established software ecosystems. ChemGen generates code to evaluate thermodynamic properties, chemical source terms, and their analytical derivatives for Jacobian calculations. Also included are a variety of implicit time integration schemes, linear solvers, and preconditioners. The various components of Chemgen are verified by demonstrating agreement with Cantera and/or theoretical convergence rates. Finally, we integrate ChemGen into OpenFOAM and achieve a speedup over its native chemistry solver by approximately four times. ChemGen is an ongoing project released under the NRL Open License, a source-available license provided by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.</description>

      <title>invDFT: A CPU-GPU massively parallel tool to find exact exchange-correlation potentials from groundstate densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) remains the most widely used electronic structure method. Although exact in principle, in practice, it relies on approximations to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, which is known to be a unique functional of the electron density. Despite 50 years of active research, existing XC approximations remain far from general purpose chemical accuracy of various thermochemical and materials properties. In that light, the inverse DFT problem, of finding the exact XC potential corresponding to an accurate groundstate density, offers an insightful tool to understand the nature of the XC functional as well as aid in the development of more accurate functionals. However, solving the inverse DFT problem is fraught with several numerical challenges, such as non-uniqueness or spurious oscillations in the solution and non-convergence. We present invDFT as an open-source framework to address the outstanding challenges in inverse DFT and computed XC potentials solely from a target density. We do so by use of a systematically convergent finite-element basis and asymptotic corrections to the target density. We also employ several numerical and high-performance computing (HPC) advances that affords both efficiency and parallel scalability, on CPU-GPU hybrid architectures. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of invDFT using accurate full-configuration interaction (FCI) densities as well as model densities, ranging up to 100 electrons and spanning both weakly and strongly correlated molecules.</description>

      <title>Tuning Layer Orbital Hall Effect via Spin Rotation in Ferromagnetic Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbitronics, which leverages the angular momentum of atomic orbitals for information transmission, provides a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of electronic devices. Unlike electron spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is strongly influenced by crystal field effects and band topology, making its orientation difficult to manipulate with external fields. In this work, by using first principle calculations, we investigate quantum anomalous Hall insulators (QAHIs) as a model system to study the layer orbital Hall effect (OHE). Due to band inversion, only one valley remains orbital polarization, and thus the OHE originates from a single valley. Based on stacking symmetry analysis, we investigated both AA and AB stacking configurations, which possess mirror and inversion symmetries, respectively. The excitation of OAM exhibits valley selectivity, determined jointly by valley polarization and orbital polarization. In AA stacking, the absence of inversion center gives rise to intrinsic orbital polarization, leading to OAM excitations from different valleys in the two layers. In contrast, AB stacking is protected by inversion symmetry, which enforces valley polarization and</description>

      <title>Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization using Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature (E3C) Hyper-Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational homogenization of elastoplastic polycrystals is a challenging task due to the huge number of grains required, their complicated interactions and due to the complexity of crystal plasticity models per se. Despite a few successes of reduced order models, mean field and simplified homogenization approaches often remain the preferred choice. In this work, a recently proposed hyper-reduction method (called E3C) for projection-based Reduced Order Models (pROMs) is applied to the problem of computational homogenization of geometrically linearly deforming elastoplastic polycrystals. The main novelty lies in the identification of reduced modes (the 'E3C-modes'), which replace the strain modes of the reduced-order model, leading to a significantly smaller number of integration points. The peculiarity, which distinguishes the method from more conventional hyper-reduction techniques, is that the E3C integration points are not taken from the set of FE integration points. Instead, they can be interpreted as generalized integration points in strain space which are trained such as to satisfy an orthogonality condition, which ensures that the hyper-reduced model matches the equilibrium states and macroscopic stresses of full-field model data as accurately as possible. In addition, the number of grains is reduced, preserving the main features of the original texture of the finite element model. Two macroscopic engineering parts (untextured and textured) are simulated, illustrating the performance of the method in three-dimensional two-scale applications involving hundreds of thousands macroscopic degrees of freedom and millions of grains with computing times in the order of hours (cumulated online and offline effort) on standard laptop hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirped coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) is a flow diagnostic technique that offers high signal-to-noise ratios and nanosecond temporal resolution. To extract information of dilute gas flow, experimental spectra must be compared with theoretical predictions derived from the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we develop a MATLAB code that deterministically solves the Boltzmann equation to compute CRBS spectra, enabling each line shape to be obtained in about one minute. We find that the CRBS spectrum is highly sensitive to the intermolecular potential, and that rapid chirping generates fine ripples around the Rayleigh peak along with spectral asymmetries.</description>

      <title>A physics-aware deep learning model for shear band formation around collapsing pores in shocked reactive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.</description>

      <title>Time-Dilation Methods for Extreme Multiscale Timestepping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales around 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks, galaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple strongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\bf x},\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale, because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential (uMLIP) to investigate ionic transport mechanisms in ternary halide solid electrolytes of the Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ family (x = 0 to 6), which are promising candidates for solid-state battery applications. We present a strategy for generating ordered structural models from experimentally derived disordered Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ (LYC) and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$ (LYB) structures. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that couples molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with static density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The fine-tuning process and the resulting improvements in predictive accuracy are benchmarked across energy predictions, structure optimizations, and diffusion coefficient calculations. Finally, we analyze the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted ionic conductivity in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.</description>

Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Electrical Conductivities of Aluminum Up to 1000 eV: A First-Principles Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the thermal and electrical conductivities of materials under extremely high temperatures is essential in high-energy-density physics. These properties govern processes such as stellar core dynamics, planetary magnetic field generation, and laser-driven plasma evolution. However, first-principles methods like Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) face challenges in predicting these properties due to prohibitively high computational costs. We propose a scheme that integrates the Kubo formalism with a mixed stochastic-deterministic DFT (mDFT) method, which substantially enhances efficiency in computing thermal and electrical conductivities of dense plasmas under extremely high temperatures. As a showcase, this approach enables {\it ab initio} calculations of the thermal and electrical conductivities of Aluminum (Al) up to 1000 eV. Compared to traditional transport models, our first-principles results reveal significant deviations in the thermal and electrical conductivities of Al within the warm dense matter regime, underscoring the importance of accounting for quantum effects when investigating these transport properties of warm dense matter.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Origins of Oxidation Resistance in Amorphous Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous boron nitride (\textrm{$\alpha$}-BN) is a promising ultrathin barrier for nanoelectronics, yet the atomistic mechanisms governing its chemical stability remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the structure-property relationship that dictates the oxidation of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN using a combination of machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The simulations reveal that the film structure, controlled by synthesis conditions, is the critical factor determining oxidation resistance. Dense, chemically ordered networks with a high fraction of B-N bonds effectively resist oxidation by confining it to the surface, whereas porous, defect-rich structures with abundant homonuclear B-B and N-N bonds permit oxygen penetration and undergo extensive bulk degradation. These computational findings are consistent with experimental trends observed in \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN films grown by chemical vapour deposition. XPS analysis shows that a film grown at a higher temperature develops a more ordered structure with a B/N ratio nearer to stoichiometric and exhibits superior resistance to surface oxidation compared to its more defective, lower-temperature counterpart. Together, these results demonstrate that the oxidation resistance of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN is a tunable property directly linked to its atomic-scale morphology, providing a clear framework for engineering chemically robust dielectric barriers for future nanoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.</description>

      <title>Gradient Enhanced Self-Training Physics-Informed Neural Network (gST-PINN) for Solving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed, offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$ equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after 12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease, demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of $10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.</description>

      <title>Uniformly High Order Discontinuous Galerkin Gas Kinetic Scheme for Compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a uniformly high-order discontinuous Galerkin gas kinetic scheme (DG-HGKS) is proposed to solve the Euler equations of compressible flows. The new scheme is an extension of the one-stage compact and efficient high-order GKS (CEHGKS, Li et al. , 2021. J. Comput. Phys. 447, 110661) in the finite volume framework. The main ideas of the new scheme consist of two parts. Firstly, starting from a fully discrete DG formulation, the numerical fluxes and volume integrals are expanded in time. Secondly, the time derivatives are replaced by spatial derivatives using the techniques in CEHGKS. To suppress the non-physical oscillations in the discontinuous regions while minimizing the number of "troubled cells", an effective limiter strategy compatible with the new scheme has been developed by combining the KXRCF indicator and the SHWENO reconstruction technique. The new scheme can achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in both space and time, thereby breaking the previous limitation of no more than third-order accuracy in existing one-stage DG-HGKS schemes. Numerical tests in 1D and 2D have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the scheme.</description>

      <title>A model for transport of soluble surfactants in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel transport model for soluble surfactants in two-phase flows. In a two-phase flow, the soluble surfactants can adsorb/desorb from/into the bulk of any of the phases to the interface and can modify the interface properties. This results in sharp gradients in the surfactant concentration on the interface and also between the two phases in the bulk when there is selective adsorption/desorption, presenting a serious challenge for the numerical simulations.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational model for the transport of soluble surfactants that can model the adsorption and desorption processes accurately. The model is discretized using a central-difference scheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the simulation of turbulent flows. The model is used with the ACDI diffuse-interface method (Jain, 2022), but can also be used with other algebraic-based interface-capturing methods. Furthermore, the provable strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the positivity property of the surfactant concentration field, a physical realizability requirement for the simulation of surfactants, when the proposed criterion is satisfied, (b) the proposed model maintains discrete confinement of the interfacial and bulk surfactants and prevents artificial numerical diffusion of the surfactant between the interface and the bulk and between the two phases in the bulk.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations using the proposed model for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases and assess: the accuracy and robustness of the model, the validity of the positivity property of the scalar concentration field, and the confinement of the surfactant at the interface. We also study the effect of surfactants on an oscillating droplet and on a complex droplet/bubble-laden turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann method for electromagnetic wave scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as an alternative numerical approach for electromagnetic scattering. The method is systematically validated over a wide range of size parameters, thereby covering the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometric optics regimes, through comparison with established reference solutions. For circular cylinders, both perfect electrically conducting (PEC) and dielectric, LBM results are benchmarked against analytical Mie theory. For dielectric cylinders, comparisons are performed over a broad range of relative permittivities to assess accuracy across different material contrasts. Scattering from dielectric spheres is likewise compared with exact Mie solutions, showing excellent agreement. To assess performance for non-canonical geometries, we investigate a hexagonal dielectric cylinder and validate the results against the Discretized Mie-Formalism, demonstrating that LBM can accurately capture edge diffraction and sharp-facet effects. Overall, the study provides the first systematic benchmarking of LBM for electromagnetic scattering in one-, two-, and three-dimensional configurations, establishing it as a promising and versatile tool in computational electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bio-nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet with slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viscous, incompressible, micropolar bio-nanofluid flowing across a stretching sheet in three dimensions while being driven to convect several slip boundaries in the presence of a magnetic field was studied. With the assistance of the relevant transformations, a mathematical model is presented. The finite difference method numerically solves the converted non-linear ordinary differential equations. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to examine the impact of governing parameters on dimensionless velocity, micro-rotation, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, microorganisms, and heat transfer rate. The findings of this investigation showed a strong correlation when compared to previous studies, indicating a high level of agreement and consistency between the results. The study's conclusions indicate that the velocity profile increases with higher values of {\lambda} and {\delta}, while it decreases with higher values of A, {\delta}v, and M. The micro-rotation profile F({\eta}) drops as the spin gradient viscosity parameter rises, but G({\eta}) increases. The temperature profile decreases with higher Prandtl numbers but increases with higher thermophoresis parameters. The concentration profile decreases with higher Schmidt numbers and Brownian motion parameters. The microorganism profile increases with higher Peclet numbers and microorganism slip parameters but decreases with higher bio-convection Schmidt numbers. Lastly, the local Nusselt number grows with increasing values of the stretching parameter {\lambda}.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical investigation of heat transfer of porous fin in a local thermal non-equilibrium state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research employs a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model to analyze the heat transfer phenomenon through a porous fin, considering natural convection and radiation effects. The infiltration velocity within the porous medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio, dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore, increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external radiation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new reservoir computing method for forecasting high-resolution spatiotemporal datasets. By combining multi-resolution inputs from coarser to finer layers, our architecture better captures both local and global dynamics. Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel reservoir models in long-term forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-layers coupling in improving predictive accuracy. Finally, we show that the optimal network dynamics in each layer become increasingly linear, revealing the slow modes propagated to subsequent layers.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in magnetic materials using the local spin density approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</description>

For time-discretization we derive an implicit energy-conserving average-vector field method or apply an explicit strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. We also consider a coupling of the fluid model to relativistic particles. We perform a numerical study of the scheme which shows convergence and conservation properties of the proposed methods and apply the new scheme to a plasma wake field simulation.</description>

      <title>Disorder to Order Transition in 1D Nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extensively study the phenomenology of one dimensional Nonreciprocal Cahn Hilliard model for varying nonreciprocity $(\alpha)$ and different boundary conditions. At small $\alpha$, a perturbed uniform state evolves to a defect laden configuration that lacks global polar order. Defects are the sources and sinks of travelling waves and nonreciprocity selects defects with a unique wave number that increases monotonically with $\alpha_c$. A critical threshold $\alpha_c$ marks the onset of a transition to states with finite global polar order. For periodic boundaries, above $\alpha_c$, the system shows travelling waves that are completely ordered. In contrast, travelling waves are incompatible with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. Instead, for $\alpha \gtrsim \alpha_c$, we find fluctuating domains that show intermittent polar order and at large $\alpha$, the system partitions into two domains with opposite polar order.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT) approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique.</description>

      <title>3D Anderson localization of light in disordered systems of dielectric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of full-wave numerical simulations of light transmission through layers of irregular dielectric particles, demonstrating three-dimensional Anderson localization of light in disordered, uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer suppresses the transverse spreading of a propagating beam. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential temporal dependence is observed in short-pulse time-resolved transmission measurements as the system approaches the Ioffe-Regel condition. Along with this, near-field dynamics leads over time to the formation of spatially localized modes and the transmission spectrum becomes consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction of scatterers and the refractive index contrast enhances the non-exponential behavior induced by disorder, which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Simulating Three-dimensional Turbulence with Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate plasmon-assisted photoelectron emission using a one-dimensional time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) model. Photoelectron spectra are computed with the time-dependent surface-flux (t-SURFF) method. In addition to the expected above-threshold ionization (ATI) comb, we observe peaks that arise from long-lived plasmon oscillations and the associated electron emission occurring after the laser pulse. We further analyze the positions of these peaks and their scaling behavior with the laser intensity.</description>
