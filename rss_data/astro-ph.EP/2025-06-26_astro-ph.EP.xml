      <title>Exoplanet exploration in the context of the PLATO mission: From detection to population studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis constitutes an observational effort to advance our understanding of planet formation and evolution across different regimes. To do so, we exploited Kepler/K2 and TESS data in combination with ground-based observations, serving as a preparation for the PLATO mission. This endeavour led to the discovery and statistical validation of four planets, the confirmation and characterisation of two other planets, the detection of 14 new planet candidates, and the revision of the properties of 25 previously reported planets. Among them, we find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a density below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition, and we thus refer to TOI-244 b as a low-density super-Earth (LDSE). We also confirm the transiting super-Neptune TOI-5005 b. In this system, we find photometric variability that matches the planetary orbital period, suggesting the existence of magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPIs). We also detect similar synchronised signals in the eccentric HD 118203 system, which appear and disappear across different orbits, in agreement with the well-known 'on/off' nature of MSPIs. At a population level, we find that LDSEs tend to be hosted by stars with subsolar metallicities and that the lowest dense LDSEs tend to receive low insolation fluxes. We also identify an over-density of Neptunian planets in orbits corresponding to periods between ~3.2 and 5.7 days, which we refer to as the Neptunian 'ridge'. The 'ridge', coinciding with the orbital range of the hot Jupiter pileup, suggests a common path in the evolution of the closest giant planets. The low-insolation trend of LDSEs suggests that the largest fraction of volatile elements in these planets is directly exposed to the received irradiation from their host stars. Solving these two problems will greatly contribute to completing the full picture of the evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of eccentricity in planet-disc interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has promoted the use of a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local scale height. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>A JWST study of CO$_2$ on the satellites of Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state CO$_2$ has been detected throughout the outer solar system, even at temperatures where crystalline CO$_2$ is unstable, requiring that the CO$_2$ be trapped in a separate host material. The Saturnian satellites provide an ideal laboratory for the study of this trapped CO$_2$, allowing us to examine objects with identical insolation, but with a range of environments, ice exposure, organic abundance, and formation locations. Here, we present JWST spectra of 8 mid-sized satellites of Saturn, including Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea interior to Titan, and Hyperion, Iapetus, and Phoebe exterior. The $\sim$4.26 $\mu$m CO$_2$ $\nu_3$ band is detected on each satellite, and the $\sim$2.7 $\mu$m $\nu_1+\nu_3$ band is detected on all but Phoebe and the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. Based on the wavelength shifts of these bands, we find four separate types of trapped CO$_2$ on the satellites. On the inner satellites, CO$_2$ appears trapped in amorphous ice sourced from Saturn's E-ring, and a second component of CO$_2$ is associated with the dark material most prominent on the trailing hemispheres of Dione and Rhea. On the outer satellites, CO$_2$ appears to be produced by irradiation of organics on Phoebe, which are then transported to the dark leading hemisphere of Iapetus and onto the dark regions of Hyperion. CO$_2$ is also trapped by water ice on the trailing hemisphere of Iapetus and on Hyperion. These observations point to the continued need for laboratory studies to better understand the sources and trapping mechanisms of CO$_2$ throughout the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>JWST Near Infrared Spectroscopy of High Albedo Jupiter Trojans: A New Surface Type in the Trojan Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 0.8 to 5 $\mu$m JWST spectra of four $\sim$20 km diameter Jupiter Trojans known to have albedos elevated above the values typical in the remaining Trojan population. The spectra of these four high albedo Jupiter Trojans are all similar, with red slopes in the optical-IR transition region, a break to lower slopes at 1.3 $\mu$m, and a broad absorptions from 2.8 to 4 $\mu$m. The 0.8 to 2.5 $\mu$m spectra of these objects match the spectra of neither the well-known "red" and "less-red" Jupiter Trojans nor of any known asteroid taxonomic class. The reflecticity of these objects does not rise redward of 4 $\mu$m, a property that is seen in the previous JWST observations of Jupiter Trojans only in Polymele. Indeed, the high albedo Jupiter Trojan spectra are a good match to that of Polymele, and Polymele is both the smallest Jupiter Trojan in the previous JWST sample and has the highest albedo of the objects in that sample. We conclude that Polymele and the other high albedo Jupiter Trojans represent a third class of Jupiter Trojans not represented in the more heavily-studied larger objects and are perhaps the products of recent disruptions. The Lucy flyby of Polymele in September 2027 will give a direct view of one of this new class of Jupiter Trojans.</description>

      <title>Gravity-sensitive Spectral Indices in Ultracool Dwarfs: Investigating Correlations with Metallicity and Planet Occurrence using SpeX and FIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9-2.4 micron) of gravity indices for 57 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M5.5 to L0), including exoplanet hosts TRAPPIST-1, SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154. Our dataset includes 61 spectra from the SpeX and FIRE spectrographs. Using gravity-sensitive indices such as FeH absorption (at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55 microns), the VO band at 1.06 microns, the H-band continuum, and alkali lines like K I (at 1.17 and 1.25 microns), we investigate correlations between surface gravity, stellar metallicity, and the presence of close-in transiting planets. All four planet-hosting stars show intermediate-gravity spectral signatures despite indicators of field age. However, a volume-corrected logistic regression reveals no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status. We tentatively identify a correlation between FeH_z (0.99 micron) and planet presence at the 2-sigma level, though this may reflect observational biases including transit probability, small-number statistics, and detection sensitivity. More robustly, we find a significant anti-correlation between FeH_z and metallicity ([Fe/H]) at 3.3 sigma. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows no significant metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the observed FeH_z-metallicity trend is not driven by bulk metallicity differences. We propose this anti-correlation reflects interplay between age, gravity, and composition: higher-metallicity objects may be systematically younger with lower gravities, suppressing FeH absorption. While our results only hint at a link between gravity-related characteristics and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, they underscore the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to infer properties of planet-hosting ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Measurements of three exo-planetesimal compositions: a planetary core, a chondritic body, and an icy Kuiper belt analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of planetesimal debris accreted by white dwarfs offers unique insights into the composition of exoplanets. Using far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy, we have analysed the composition of planetesimals accreted by three metal enriched H-dominated white dwarfs with effective temperatures of T_eff = 20 000 K. WD 0059+257 is accreting an object composed of 71.8 +/- 7.9 per cent Fe and Ni by mass, indicating a large core mass fraction of 69 per cent, similar to that of Mercury. We model this planetesimal as having a differentiated Earth-like composition with 65 per cent of its mantle stripped, and we find this mass loss can be caused by vaporisation of the planetesimal's mantle during post-main sequence evolution. The tentative S detection in WD 0059+257 is a possible clue to the nature of the light element in planetary cores, including that of the Earth. The volatile-rich composition of WD 1943+163 is consistent with accretion of a carbonaceous chondrite-like object, but with an extreme Si depletion. WD 1953-715 accretes a planetesimal which contains 64 +/- 21 per cent of O in the form of ices, likely H2O. This body therefore requires an initial orbit at formation beyond a radial distance of &gt; 100 au for ice survival into the white dwarf phase. These three planetary enriched white dwarfs provide evidence of differing core fractions, volatile budgets, and initial orbital separations of the accreted planetesimals, all of which help us understand their formation and evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>Follow-Up Exploration of the TWA 7 Planet-Disk System with JWST NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young M-star TWA 7 hosts a bright and near face-on debris disk, which has been imaged from the optical to the submillimeter. The disk displays multiple complex substructures such as three disk components, a large dust clump, and spiral arms, suggesting the presence of planets to actively sculpt these features. The evidence for planets in this disk was further strengthened with the recent detection of a point-source compatible with a Saturn-mass planet companion using JWST/MIRI at 11 $\mu$m, at the location a planet was predicted to reside based on the disk morphology. In this paper, we present new observations of the TWA 7 system with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. The disk is detected at both wavelengths and presents many of the same substructures as previously imaged, although we do not robustly detect the southern spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect two faint potential companions in the F444W filter at the 2-3$\sigma$ level. While one of these companions needs further followup to determine its nature, the other one coincides with the location of the planet candidate imaged with MIRI, providing further evidence that this source is a sub-Jupiter mass planet companion rather than a background galaxy. Such discoveries make TWA 7 only the second system, after $\beta$ Pictoris, in which a planet predicted by the debris disk morphology has been detected.</description>

      <title>Hundreds of TESS exoplanets might be larger than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius of a planet is a fundamental parameter that probes its composition and habitability. Precise radius measurements are typically derived from the fraction of starlight blocked when a planet transits its host star. The wide-field Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new exoplanets, but its low angular resolution means that the light from a star hosting a transiting exoplanet can be blended with the light from background stars. If not fully corrected, this extra light can dilute the transit signal and result in a smaller measured planet radius. In a study of hundreds of TESS planet discoveries using deblended light curves from our validated methodology, we show that systematically incorrect planet radii are common in the literature: studies using various public TESS photometry pipelines have underestimated the planet radius by a weighted median of $6.1\% \pm 0.3\%$, leading to a $\sim20\%$ overestimation of planet density. The widespread presence of these biases in the literature has profoundly shaped-and potentially misrepresented-our understanding of the exoplanet population. Addressing these biases will refine the exoplanet mass-radius relation, reshape our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric and bulk composition, and potentially inform prevailing planet formation theories.</description>

      <title>Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT 'EM) Survey. VI: Confirmation of a Long-Period Giant Planet Discovered with a Single TESS Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and confirmation of TOI-4465 b, a $1.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~R_{J}$, $5.89\pm0.26~M_{J}$ giant planet orbiting a G dwarf star at $d\simeq$ 122 pc. The planet was detected as a single-transit event in data from Sector 40 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Radial velocity (RV) observations of TOI-4465 showed a planetary signal with an orbital period of $\sim$102 days, and an orbital eccentricity of $e=0.24\pm0.01$. TESS re-observed TOI-4465 in Sector 53 and Sector 80, but did not detect another transit of TOI-4465 b, as the planet was not expected to transit during these observations based on the RV period. A global ground-based photometry campaign was initiated to observe another transit of TOI-4465 b after the RV period determination. The $\sim$12 hour-long transit event was captured from multiple sites around the world, and included observations from 24 citizen scientists, confirming the orbital period as $\sim$102 days. TOI-4465 b is a relatively dense ($3.73\pm0.53~\rm{g/cm^3}$), temperate (375-478 K) giant planet. Based on giant planet structure models, TOI-4465 b appears to be enriched in heavy elements at a level consistent with late-stage accretion of icy planetesimals. Additionally, we explore TOI-4465 b's potential for atmospheric characterization, and obliquity measurement. Increasing the number of long-period planets by confirming single-transit events is crucial for understanding the frequency and demographics of planet populations in the outer regions of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Can tidal evolution lead to close-in planetary bodies around white dwarfs I: Orbital period distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of planetary systems around white dwarfs is crucial to understanding the presence of planetary material in the atmospheres of white dwarfs. These systems uniquely probe exoplanetary compositions. Periodic signals in the photometry of a handful of white dwarfs suggest material blocking the star, potentially from disintegrating planetesimals. Tidal evolution followed by scattering can bring planetesimals onto close-in orbits that would have been within the envelope of the white dwarf progenitor. The orbital period distribution of planetesimals undergoing tidal evolution will peak at short-period (nearly) circularized orbits (~ 10 hour-1 day), with a rising tail towards long-period highly eccentric orbits (~ 100 day). This prediction is generally consistent with the observed white dwarf transiting systems. In order for the planetesimal on the 4.5 hour period around WD 1145+017 to be explained by the tidal evolution of a planetesimal, that planetesimal must have an ultimate tensile strength comparable to that of iron meteorites.</description>

      <title>Can tidal evolution lead to close-in planetary bodies around white dwarfs II: volcanism and transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary material accreted by white dwarfs provides unique insights regarding exoplanetary composition. The evolutionary pathways of planetary bodies around white dwarfs are crucial to understanding the presence of close-in planetary material, observed in the form of pollutants in the atmospheres of white dwarfs and planetary material transiting white dwarfs. Periodic transits around white dwarfs potentially reveal the existence of close-in planetary bodies undergoing dust production. Tidal interactions can bring planetesimals that have been gravitationally perturbed onto long-period highly eccentric orbits around white dwarfs towards shorter orbital periods and smaller eccentricities. Tidal interactions may also induce melting and volcanism in these planetesimals, potentially being a mechanism for dust and debris production, the result of which may be seen in transit. Tidally induced volcanism may be triggered in a wide parameter space: for a 100km-sized rocky planetesimals perturbed to a pericentre distance $\lesssim$ 0.01AU ($\gtrsim$ twice its Roche limit), both on long-period (~ 100day) highly eccentric orbits and short-period (~ 10hr) near circular orbits. We comment on the potential link between the resultant volcanic ejecta and observed optical transits.</description>

      <title>The KELT-7b atmospheric thermal-inversion conundrum revisited with CHEOPS, TESS, and additional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahot Jupiters are predicted to show inverted temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles in the presence of optical absorbers such as TiO and VO. An inverted T-P profile of KELT-7b was recently detected, in line with these predictions, but such diagnoses are known to be model-dependent. We used CHEOPS, TESS, and literature data to characterize the atmosphere of KELT-7b, reassess its T-P profile, measure its albedo, and search for distortions in its CHEOPS transit light curve due to stellar rotation. We jointly fitted CHEOPS and TESS data to measure the occultation depths and modeled CHEOPS transits including gravity darkening. Emission and transmission retrievals were performed, and the albedo was calculated in the CHEOPS and TESS passbands. Thermochemical-equilibrium retrievals yield a non-inverted T-P profile, while free-chemistry retrievals yield an inverted profile with likely unphysical TiO/VO abundances. A 3D GCM supports a TiO-driven inversion. We report a low geometric albedo of $A_\mathrm{g} = 0.05 \pm 0.06$, consistent with inefficient heat redistribution and supported by a GCM with magnetic drag. CHEOPS data provide no constraint on the sky-projected orbital obliquity. Retrieval results strongly depend on the chemical framework. Free-chemistry fits are better but risk unphysical solutions for ultrahot Jupiters. We applied a coherent stellar variability correction to CHEOPS and TESS data; future observations would benefit from similar treatment.</description>

      <title>An Earth-like Density for the Temperate Earth-sized Planet GJ 12b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While JWST has provided us with the opportunity to probe the atmospheres of potentially-habitable planets, observations of the TRAPPIST-1 system have shown us that active stars severely complicate efforts at studying their planets. GJ 12b is a newly-discovered temperate (Teq ~ 300 K), Earth-sized (Rp = 0.96 +/- 0.05 Earth radii) planet orbiting an inactive M dwarf that might be a good alternate to the TRAPPIST-1 planets for atmospheric characterization. In this paper, we use MAROON-X radial velocities to measure a mass of 0.71 +/- 0.12 Earth masses for GJ 12b. We also find moderate evidence that the planet has an eccentric (e ~ 0.16) orbit. GJ 12b's mass results in a planetary density comparable to or less dense than Earth, possibly indicating the presence of water or a low bulk iron mass fraction. With its low mass, GJ 12b is likely within reach of JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, making it an excellent target for determining the location of the cosmic shoreline. Its low mass may mean that the planet could have trouble retaining its primary atmosphere during the star's active pre-main-sequence phase. However, if it has a heightened eccentricity, it may be able to sustain a secondary atmosphere through tidally-induced volcanism.</description>

      <title>The mass of the exo-Venus Gliese 12 b, as revealed by HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small temperate planets are prime targets for exoplanet studies due to their possible similarities with the rocky planets in the Solar System. M dwarfs are promising hosts since the planetary signals are within our current detection capabilities. Gliese 12 b is a Venus-sized temperate planet orbiting a quiet M dwarf. We present here the first precise mass measurement of this small exoplanet. We performed a detailed analysis using HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES radial velocities, along with new and archival TESS, CHEOPS, and MuSCAT2/3 photometry data. From fitting the available data, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_\mathrm{p} = 0.904^{+0.037}_{-0.034} \,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_\mathrm{p} = 0.95^{+0.26}_{-0.27} \,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (a $3.6\sigma$ measurement of the semi-amplitude $K=0.70^{+0.19}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$), and is on an orbit with a period of $12.761421 \pm 0.000047\,\mathrm{d}$. A variety of techniques were utilised to attenuate stellar activity signals. Gliese 12 b has an equilibrium temperature of $T_\mathrm{eq}=315 \pm 7\,\mathrm{K}$, assuming an albedo of zero, and a density consistent with that of Earth and Venus ($\rho_\mathrm{p}=7.0^{+2.3}_{-2.1}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). We find that Gliese 12 b has a predominantly rocky interior and simulations indicate that it is unlikely to have retained any of its primordial gaseous envelope. The bulk properties of Gliese 12 b place it in an extremely sparsely-populated region of both mass--radius and density--$T_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter space, making it a prime target for follow-up observations, including Lyman-$\alpha$ studies.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Architectures of Multiplanet Systems from Kepler, K2, and TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet surveys like Kepler, TESS, and K2 have shown that planetary systems are common in our galaxy. These surveys, along with several others, have identified thousands of planetary candidates, with more than five thousand having already been confirmed. Many of these planetary systems host multiple planets. As we discover more multiplanet systems, notable trends begin to appear in the data. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs in multiplanet systems in the most recent Kepler, TESS and K2 data, paying particular attention to pairs in first order mean motion resonance (MMR). We compare a recent Kepler catalog with the DR25 data release. We also compare TESS and K2 against the latest Kepler catalog. To verify the significance of our findings against selection bias, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of multiplanet systems, finding an excess of planet pairs near the 2.2, 2 (2:1), and 1.5 (3:2) period ratios in the Kepler, K2, and TESS catalogs, all exceeding the 99% confidence interval when constrained to orbital periods less than 25 days. We identify two planet pairs orbiting M dwarf stars in a very tight ratio, as well as two likely misidentified planet pairs.</description>

      <title>SPP location with spherical ray tracing by refractive index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric layer structure is a primary factor affecting the precision of single-point satellite positioning. The assumption of electromagnetic wave rectilinear propagation hinders the accurate implementation of ionospheric and tropospheric corrections, whereas curvilinear positioning methods fully account for ray deflection. This study aims to derive partial derivative formulas for theoretical travel time with respect to latitude, longitude, elevation, and velocity models by formulating electromagnetic wave travel time equations under a coordinate-based one-dimensional layered velocity model. Subsequently, a linearized LSQR method is employed to invert station coordinates, receiver clock biases, and electromagnetic wave velocities at the bottom of the ionosphere and troposphere using over six sets of observations. This replaces conventional ionospheric/tropospheric pseudorange corrections in single-point positioning, establishing a novel spherical coordinate refraction travel time positioning method. The classical straight-line pseudorange positioning is reformulated into a time-of-flight positioning approach, and the positioning accuracy differences between straight-line and spherical coordinate refraction travel time methods are compared. By integrating classical ionospheric and tropospheric models to construct corresponding refractive index models and combining them with curvilinear ray tracing methods, the inherent theoretical limitations of positioning can be effectively mitigated.</description>

      <title>Shaping Galactic Habitability: the impact of stellar migration and gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In exoplanet research, the focus is increasingly on identifying Earth analogs, planets similar in density and habitability potential. As the number of rocky exoplanets grows, parallel discussions have emerged on system architectures and Galactic environments that may support life, drawing comparisons to our own Earth. This has brought renewed attention to the concept of the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) as a broader context for interpreting the diversity of planetary environments. This study is the first to use detailed chemical evolution models to investigate the impact of stellar migration, modeled through a parametric approach, on the GHZ. Our findings reveal that stellar migration significantly enhances the number of stars capable of hosting habitable planets in the outer Galactic regions, with an increase of up to a factor of five at 18 kpc relative to a baseline value of unity at 6 kpc. Furthermore, we explore a novel scenario where the presence of gas giant planets increases the probability for the formation of terrestrial ones. We find that this increased probability is higher in the inner Galactic disc, but is also mitigated by stellar migration. In particular, at the present time, the number of FGK stars hosting terrestrial planets with minimum habitability conditions in the ring centered at 4 kpc is approximately 1.4 times higher than in scenarios where gas giants are assumed to hinder the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets. Without stellar migration, this factor increases to 1.5. Even larger ratios are predicted for terrestrial planets orbiting retired A stars, reaching 2.8 in models with stellar migration and 3.3 in models without it.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches &gt;=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of hot O production and escape from Martian atmosphere in response to enhanced EUV Irradiance from Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the evolution of Martian atmosphere and its response to EUV irradiation is an extremely important topic in planetary science. One of the dominant effects of atmospheric losses is the photochemical escape of atomic oxygen from Mars. Increasing the magnitude of the irradiation changes the response of the atmosphere. The purpose of the current paper is to analyze the effects of enhanced EUV irradiation on the escape rates of oxygen atoms. We have used the solar flare of 2017 September 10 as the baseline flare intensity and varied the intensity of the flare from a factor of 3 up to 10 times the baseline flare. We see an increase in the escape flux by 40% for flares up to 5x the intensity of the baseline flare. However, beyond this point, the increase in escape flux tapers off, reaching only about 17% above the baseline. At 10x the baseline flare intensity, the escape flux decreases by nearly 25% compared to the escape rate of the original flare. We also found that the total escape amount of hot O peaks at 7x the original flare intensity. Additionally, we have studied the effects of the time scales over which the flare energy is delivered. We find that energy dissipative processes like radiative cooling and thermal collisions do not come into play instantaneously. The escape flux from higher intensity flares dominate initially, but as time progresses, energy dissipative processes have a significant effect on the escape rate.</description>

      <title>Signatures of planets and Galactic subpopulations in solar analogs. Precise chemical abundances with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt; 400. We obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20 chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00 \pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the last one slightly older and poor in Na.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Non-Gaussian Instrumental Noise in Perturbed Nulling Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the astrophysics community working towards the first observations and characterizations of Earth-like exoplanets, interest in space-based nulling interferometry has been renewed. This technique promises unique scientific and technical advantages by enabling direct mid-infrared observations. However, concept studies of nulling interferometers often overlook the impact of systematic noise caused by instrument perturbations. Earlier research introduced analytical and numerical models to address instrumental noise and, building on these results, we reproduce key simulations and report that the noise in the differential output of nulling interferometers follows a non-Gaussian distribution. The presence of non-Gaussian noise challenges the validity of classical hypothesis tests in detection performance estimates, as their reliance on Gaussian assumptions leads to overconfidence in detection thresholds. For the first time, we derive the true noise distribution of the differential output of a dual Bracewell nulling interferometer, demonstrating that it follows iterative convolutions of Bessel functions. Understanding this noise distribution enables a refined formulation of hypothesis testing in nulling interferometry, leading to a semi-analytical prediction of detection performance. This computationally efficient instrument model, implemented in a publicly available codebase, is designed for integration into science yield predictions for nulling interferometry mission concepts. It will play a key role in refining key mission parameters for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and why, is a key goal for the James Webb Space Telescope. So far, emission observations of individual rocky exoplanets orbiting M stars (M-Earths) have not provided definitive evidence for atmospheres. Here, we synthesize emission data for M-Earths and find a trend in measured brightness temperatures (ratioed to its theoretical maximum value) as a function of instellation. However, the statistical evidence of this trend is dependent on the choice of stellar model, and we consider its identification tentative. We show that this trend can be explained by either the onset of thin/tenuous (&lt;1 bar) CO2-rich atmospheres on colder worlds, or a population of bare rocks with stronger space weathering and/or coarser regolith on closer-in worlds. Such grain coarsening may be caused by sintering near the melting point of rock or frequent volcanic resurfacing. Furthermore, we highlight considerations when testing rocky planet hypotheses at the population level, including the choice of instrument, stellar modeling, and how brightness temperatures are derived. We also find that fresh (unweathered) fine-grained surfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric heat redistribution through eclipse observations. However, we argue that such surfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar System, the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies, and the high stellar wind environments of M-Earths. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths will be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause through spectral characterization.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>MINDS: Detection of an inner gas disk caused by evaporating bodies around HD 172555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms such as collisions of rocky bodies or cometary activity give rise to dusty debris disks. Debris disks trace the leftover building blocks of planets, and thus also planetary composition. HD 172555, a stellar twin of beta Pic, hosts a debris disk thought to have resulted from a giant collision. It is known for its extreme mid-infrared silica dust feature, indicating a warm population of silica-rich grains in the asteroid belt (~5 au), cold CO observed by ALMA, and small bodies evaporating as they approach close to the star. Our JWST MIRI/MRS observations now reveal emission from an inner gaseous disk (&lt;0.5 au) that arises from the evaporation of close-in material. For the first time in a debris disk, we detect neutral atomic chlorine and sulfur, as well as ionized nickel. We recovered the neutral sulfur line in ~20-year-old Spitzer data, showing it is long-lived and stable. Ionized iron, previously seen only in beta Pic, is also detected. All lines are broadened by Keplerian rotation, pinpointing the gas location. The HD 172555 system serves as a unique laboratory to study the composition of planetesimals, asteroids, and comets beyond the Solar System. The comparison to beta Pic reveals, that the gas in HD 172555 is hotter, closer to the star, and poor in argon -- suggesting it originates from evaporating rocky bodies near the star, while beta Pic's gas may trace volatile-rich bodies from larger separations.</description>

      <title>Earth's Infrared Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like Johnson noise, where the thermal fluctuations of charge carriers in a resistor lead to current fluctuations, the internal variability of Earth's atmosphere leads to fluctuations in the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) emitted to space, creating "Earth's Infrared Background" (EIB). We identify the background with spatially isotropic, random variability consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It allows one to distinguish it from atmospheric variability on preferred spatiotemporal scales, including the annual/seasonal/daily cycles, waves, storms, and other coherent modes. Thus, like the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), where anisotropies in the microwave radiation represent features of interest in the Universe, anisotropies in the OLR represent features of interest in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the CMB, which represents a snapshot of the early Universe, the EIB represents Earth's climate in (quasi-) steady state and is therefore described by its spatiotemporal variability. By fitting the OLR from satellite observations to a stochastically forced $\varepsilon$nergy balance climate model, we find that the EIB consists of random fluctuations with a standard deviation of 26.5 W m$^{-2}$, compared to the mean 240 W m$^{-2}$ flux emitted to space. These fluctuations have a red spectrum in both space and time with an upper bound of 400 km and 2.5 days on their spatiotemporal decorrelation, between meso-scale and synoptic-scale weather.</description>

      <title>The JDISC Survey: Linking the Physics and Chemistry of Inner and Outer Protoplanetary Disk Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical inventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around older stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): overview of program and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].</description>

      <title>Lunar Time Ephemeris LTE440: User Manual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the numerical lunar time ephemeris LTE440 based on the definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) given by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in IAU 2024 Resolution II. LTE440 can be used to obtain the numerical transformation between TCL and Solar System Barycentric Dynamical Time (TCL-TDB) or Solar System Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCL-TCB). The theoretical model, numerical method, and performance of LTE440 are discussed. The secular drifts between TCL and TDB and between TCL and TCB are respectively estimated as $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TDB}\right&gt;=1+6.798\,355\,238\times10^{-10}$, and $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TCB}\right&gt;=1-1.482\,536\,216\,67\times10^{-8}$. The most significant periodic terms have amplitudes of about 1651 microseconds for the annual term and 126 microseconds for the monthly term. The precision of LTE440 is estimated to be at the level of several picoseconds. LTE440 is freely available at https://github.com/xlucn/LTE440.</description>
