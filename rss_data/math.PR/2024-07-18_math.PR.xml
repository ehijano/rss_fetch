      <title>Boundary-induced slow mixing for Markov chains and its application to stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant of dimension $d$ are often used to model the stochastic dynamics of the number of $d$ entities, such as $d$ chemical species in stochastic reaction networks. The infinite state space poses technical challenges, and the boundary of the quadrant can have a dramatic effect on the long term behavior of these Markov chains. For instance, the boundary can slow down the convergence speed of an ergodic Markov chain towards its stationary distribution due to the extinction or the lack of an entity. In this paper, we quantify this slow-down for a class of stochastic reaction networks and for more general Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant. We establish general criteria for such a Markov chain to exhibit a power-law lower bound for its mixing time. The lower bound is of order $|x|^\theta$ for all initial state $x$ on a boundary face of the quadrant, where $\theta$ is characterized by the local behavior of the Markov chain near the boundary of the quadrant. A better understanding of how these lower bounds arise leads to insights into how the structure of chemical reaction networks contributes to slow-mixing.</description>

      <title>Outliers for deformed inhomogeneous random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous random matrices with a non-trivial variance profile determined by a symmetric stochastic matrix and with independent symmetrically sub-Gaussian entries up to Hermitian symmetry, include many prominent examples, such as remarkable sparse Wigner matrices and random band matrices in dimension d, and have been of great interest recently. The maximum of entry variances as a natural proxy of sparsity is both a key feature and a significant obstacle. In this paper, we study low-rank additive perturbations of such random matrices, and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at the level of law of large numbers. Under suitable conditions on the variance profile and the finite-rank perturbation, we also establish the fluctuations of spectral outliers that may be characterized by the general inhomogeneous random matrices. This reveals the strong non-universality phenomena, which may depend on eigenvectors, sparsity or geometric structure. Our proofs rely on ribbon graph expansions, upper bounds for diagram functions, large moment estimates and counting of typical diagrams.</description>

      <title>Planar reinforced $k$-out percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation properties of a planar reinforced network model. In this model, at every time step, every vertex chooses $k \ge 1$ incident edges, whose weight is then increased by 1. The choice of this $k$-tuple occurs proportionally to the product of the corresponding edge weights raised to some power $\alpha &gt; 0$. Our investigations are guided by the conjecture that the set of infinitely reinforced edges percolates for $k = 2$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. First, we study the case $\alpha = \infty$, where we show the percolation for $k = 2$ after adding arbitrarily sparse independent sprinkling and also allowing dual connectivities. We also derive a finite-size criterion for percolation without sprinkling. Then, we extend this finite-size criterion to the $\alpha &lt; \infty$ case. Finally, we verify these conditions numerically.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time and topology in 1D $O(N)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relaxation time (inverse spectral gap) of the one dimensional $O(N)$ model, for all $N$ and with two types of boundary conditions. We see how its low temperature asymptotic behavior is affected by the topology. The combination of the space dimension, which here is always 1, the boundary condition (free or periodic), and the spin state $S^{N-1}$, determines the existence or absence of non-trivial homotopy classes in some discrete version. Such non-trivial topology reflects in bottlenecks of the dynamics, creating metastable states that the system exits at exponential times; while when only one homotopy class exists the relaxation time depends polynomially on the temperature. We prove in the one dimensional case that, indeed, the relaxation time is a proxy to the model's topological properties via the exponential/polynomial dependence on the temperature.</description>

      <title>Stein's method and general clocks: diffusion approximation of the $G/G/1$ workload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin developing the theory of the generator comparison approach of Stein's method for continuous-time Markov processes where jumps are driven by clocks having general distributions, as opposed to exponential distributions. This paper handles models with a single general clock.
  Using the workload process in the $G/G/1$ queueing system as a driving example, we develop two variants of the generator comparison approach for models with a single general clock: the original, which we call the limiting approach, and the recently proposed prelimit approach. The approaches are duals of one another, yielding distinct bounds on the diffusion approximation error of the steady-state workload.
  We also contribute to the theory of heavy-traffic approximations for the $G/G/1$ system. Under some assumptions on the interarrival time distribution, the prelimit approach allows us to bound the diffusion approximation error in terms of $G/G/1$ model primitives. For example, when the interarrival time has a nonincreasing hazard rate that is bounded from above, we show that the diffusion approximation error of the expected workload is bounded in terms of the first three moments of the interarrival and service-time distributions, as well as the upper bound on the interarrival hazard rate.</description>

Abstract: We study heat kernel rigidity for the Lie group $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$ kernel equipped with a sub-Riemannian structure. We prove that a metric measure space equipped with a heat kernel of a special form is bundle-isometric to the Hopf fibration $\operatorname{U}\left( 1 \right)\to \operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)\to \mathbb{CP}^1$, which coincides with the sub-Riemannian sphere $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$.</description>

      <title>On filter-type estimation of discretely sampled cyclic long-memory processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized filtered method of moments was developed in the recent papers by Alomari et al., 2020, and Ayache et al., 2022. It used functional data obtained from continuously sampled cyclic long-memory stochastic processes to simultaneously estimate their parameters. However, the majority of applications deal with discretely sampled processes or time series. This paper extends the approach to accommodate discrete-time scenarios. It proves that the new discrete estimates exhibit analogous properties to the continuous case and are strongly consistent with the same rates of convergence. The numerical study results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and to indicate the sampling rates and resolution levels required for accurate estimates.</description>

      <title>A concentration inequality for random combinatorial optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$, i.i.d. random weights $\{X_i\}_{i\in S}$, and a family of subsets $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^S$, we consider the minimum weight of an $F\in \mathcal{F}$: \[ M(\mathcal{F}):= \min_{F\in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{i\in F}X_i. \] In particular, we investigate under what conditions this random variable is sharply concentrated around its mean.
  We define the patchability of a family $\mathcal{F}$: essentially, how expensive is it to finish an almost-complete $F$ (that is, $F$ is close to $\mathcal{F}$ in Hamming distance) if the edge weights are re-randomized? Combining the patchability of $\mathcal{F}$, applying the Talagrand inequality to a dual problem, and a sprinkling-type argument, we prove a concentration inequality for the random variable $M(\mathcal{F})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of singular numbers of products of certain classes of $p$-adic random matrices, as both the matrix size and number of products go to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this limit, we prove convergence of the local statistics to a new random point configuration on $\mathbb{Z}$, defined explicitly in terms of certain intricate mixed $q$-series/exponential sums. This object may be viewed as a nontrivial $p$-adic analogue of the interpolating distributions of Akemann-Burda-Kieburg arXiv:1809.05905, which generalize the sine and Airy kernels and govern limits of complex matrix products. Our proof uses new Macdonald process computations and holds for matrices with iid additive Haar entries, corners of Haar matrices from $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, and the $p$-adic analogue of Dyson Brownian motion studied in arXiv:2112.03725.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation and limit theorems in Barak-Erd\H{o}s directed random graphs and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider directed random graphs, the prototype of which being the Barak-Erd\H{o}s graph $\vec G(\mathbb Z, p)$, and study the way that long (or heavy, if weights are present) paths grow. This is done by relating the graphs to certain particle systems that we call Infinite Bin Models (IBM). A number of limit theorems are shown. The goal of this paper is to present results along with techniques that have been used in this area. In the case of $\vec G(\mathbb Z, p)$ the last passage percolation constant $C(p)$ is studied in great detail. It is shown that $C(p)$ is analytic for $p&gt;0$, has an interesting asymptotic expansion at $p=1$ and that $C(p)/p$ converges to $e$ like $1/(\log p)^2$ as $p \to 0$. The paper includes the study of IBMs as models on their own as well as their connections to stochastic models of branching processes in continuous or discrete time with selection. Several proofs herein are new or simplified versions of published ones. Regenerative techniques are used where possible, exhibiting random sets of vertices over which the graphs regenerate. When edges have random weights we show how the last passage percolation constants behave and when central limit theorems exist. When the underlying vertex set is partially ordered, new phenomena occur, e.g., there are relations with last passage Brownian percolation. We also look at weights that may possibly take negative values and study in detail some special cases that require combinatorial/graph theoretic techniques that exhibit some interesting non-differentiability properties of the last passage percolation constant. We also explain how to approach the problem of estimation of last passage percolation constants by means of perfect simulation.</description>

      <title>Tightness and weak convergence in the topology of local uniform convergence for stochastic processes in the dual of a nuclear space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Phi'$ denote the strong dual of a nuclear space $\Phi$ and let $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ be the collection of all continuous mappings $x:[0,\infty) \rightarrow \Phi'$ equipped with the topology of local uniform convergence. In this paper we introduce sufficient conditions for tightness of probability measures on $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ and for weak convergence in $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ for a sequence of $\Phi'$-valued processes. We illustrate our result with two applications. First, we show a version of the central limit theorem for local martingales taking values in the dual of an ultrabornological nuclear space. Second, we introduce sufficient conditions for weak convergence in $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ for a sequence of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations driven by semimartingale noise.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for statistics of randomly weighted complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove normal approximation bounds for statistics of randomly weighted (simplicial) complexes. In particular, we consider the complete $d$-dimensional complex on $n$ vertices with $d$-simplices equipped with i.i.d. weights. Our normal approximation bounds are quantified in terms of stabilization of difference operators, i.e., the effect on the statistic under addition/deletion of simplices. Our proof is based on Chatterjee's normal approximation bound and is a higher-dimensional analogue of the work of Cao on sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs but our bounds are more in the spirit of `quantitative two-scale stabilization' bounds by Lachi\`eze-Rey, Peccati, and Yang. As applications, we prove a CLT for nearest face-weights in randomly weighted $d$-complexes and give a normal approximation bound for local statistics of random $d$-complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a random uniform sample of $n$ points in a compact region $A$ of Euclidean $d$-space, $d \geq 2$, with a smooth or (when $d=2$) polygonal boundary. Fix $k \in {\bf N}$. Let $T_{n,k}$ be the threshold $r$ at which the geometric graph on these $n$ vertices with distance parameter $r$ becomes $k$-connected. We show that if $d=2$ then $n (\pi/|A|) T_{n,1}^2 - \log n$ is asymptotically standard Gumbel. For $(d,k) \neq (2,1)$, it is $n (\theta_d/|A|) T_{n,k}^d - (2-2/d) \log n - (4-2k-2/d) \log \log n$ that converges in distribution to a nondegenerate limit, where $\theta_d$ is the volume of the unit ball. The limit is Gumbel with scale parameter 2 except when $(d,k)=(2,2)$ where the limit is two component extreme value distributed. The different cases reflect the fact that boundary effects are more more important in some cases than others. We also give similar results for the largest $k$-nearest neighbour link $U_{n,k}$ in the sample, and show $T_{n,k}=U_{n,k}$ with high probability. We provide estimates on rates of convergence and give similar results for Poisson samples in $A$. Finally, we give similar results even for non-uniform samples, with a less explicit sequence of centring constants.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks on the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) algorithms generate clouds of proposals at each step to efficiently resolve a target probability distribution. We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms which yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement our theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition to the class of continuous semimartingales that are exponentially integrable, which includes in particular affine and some polynomial diffusion processes. By omitting the orthogonality in the expansion, we are able to show that every $p$-integrable functional of the semimartingale, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be represented as a sum of iterated integrals thereof. Using finitely many terms of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense. In particular, for $p = 2$, we recover the optimal hedging strategy in the sense of quadratic hedging. Moreover, since the hedging strategy of the approximating option can be computed in closed form, we obtain an efficient algorithm to approximately replicate any sufficiently integrable financial derivative within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Hitting probabilities for fast stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical phenomena are modeled as stochastic searchers looking for targets. In these models, the probability that a searcher finds a particular target, its so-called hitting probability, is often of considerable interest. In this work we determine hitting probabilities for stochastic search processes conditioned on being faster than a random short time. Such times have been used to model stochastic resetting or stochastic inactivation. These results apply to any search process, diffusive or otherwise, whose unconditional short-time behavior can be adequately approximated, which we characterize for broad classes of stochastic search. We illustrate these results in several examples and show that the conditional hitting probabilities depend predominantly on the relative geodesic lengths between the initial position of the searcher and the targets. Finally, we apply these results to a canonical evidence accumulation model for decision making.</description>
