      <title>A new True Triaxial Apparatus with pore fluid system for rock deformation under representative crustal stress conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new True Triaxial Apparatus (TTA) for rock deformation consisting of six servo-controlled loading rams that transmit maximum stresses of 220 MPa in the two horizontal axes and 400 MPa in the vertical axis to 50 mm side cubic rock samples. The sample and loading platens are introduced in a steel vessel where rock specimens can be subjected to up to 60 MPa of confining pressure, and pore fluids line connected to two pump intensifiers allow for highly accurate permeability measurements along the three loading axes. We present a suite of Finite Element Method (FEM) models implemented to determine the conditions and loading configuration that minimise the loading boundary effects during true triaxial loading. These observations are generic and we expect they will contribute to the development of true triaxial loading systems generally. Finally, we validate our experimental configuration by presenting results on permeability measurements along the three axes on cubic samples of three types of well studied rocks: Darley Dale sandstone, Crab Orchard sandstone, and Etna basalt.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Modeling of Microporosity and Permeability in Clastic Reservoirs Using Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting microporosity and permeability in clastic reservoirs is a challenge in reservoir quality assessment, especially in formations where direct measurements are difficult or expensive. These reservoir properties are fundamental in determining a reservoir's capacity for fluid storage and transmission, yet conventional methods for evaluating them, such as Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are resource-intensive. The aim of this study is to develop a cost-effective machine learning model to predict complex reservoir properties using readily available field data and basic laboratory analyses. A Random Forest classifier was employed, utilizing key geological parameters such as porosity, grain size distribution, and spectral gamma-ray (SGR) measurements. An uncertainty analysis was applied to account for natural variability, expanding the dataset, and enhancing the model's robustness. The model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting microporosity (93%) and permeability levels (88%). By using easily obtainable data, this model reduces the reliance on expensive laboratory methods, making it a valuable tool for early-stage exploration, especially in remote or offshore environments. The integration of machine learning with uncertainty analysis provides a reliable and cost-effective approach for evaluating key reservoir properties in siliciclastic formations. This model offers a practical solution to improve reservoir quality assessments, enabling more informed decision-making and optimizing exploration efforts.</description>

      <title>Seismotectonics and Slip Behavior of a Submarine Plate Boundary Fault from Seismicity Repeaters and Tomography using a high-resolution earthquake catalog from machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blanco transform fault system (BTFS) is highly segmented and represents an evolving transform plate boundary in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Its seismic behavior was captured with a dense network of 54 ocean-bottom-seismometers operated for one year. We created a high-resolution earthquake catalog based on different machine learning onset pickers, resulting in a high-resolution seismicity catalog with 12.708 events outlining the current deformation and stress release along a major transform fault. Seismicity reveals lateral changes of seismic behavior, indicating seismic and aseismic fault patches or segments, complex along-strike and off-axis deformation, step-overs, and internal faulting within pull-apart basins. Seismicity along simple linear fault strands is localized within 2 km of the seafloor expression of the fault. Repeaters indicate an average of 21 cm slip, exceeding the geological slip rate by ~4 times. Based on the repeater behavior, we suggest that the (overall aseismic) slip is spatially very heterogeneous, consisting of many small seismic patches, each one releasing its seismic slip every 4 years. Along the BTFS, the coupling of the fault is variable and varies between fully locked and fully creeping. Local earthquake tomography shows elevated vp/vs values exceeding 2, suggesting significant serpentinization from seawater entering the transform faults, the oceanic crust and mantle. The study shows how to use modern machine learning pickers on OBS data to provide essential insights into the physics of faulting along major plate boundary faults in time and space, including the partitioning of slip seismic and aseismic faulting with high resolution.</description>

      <title>Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field, assuming it has such relicts that were magnetized after nebula dispersal via one of two distinct pathways: i. an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid and ii. a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. Field topology and orientation may thus reveal key details of the nature and history of (16) Psyche, and our framework is broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates machine learning, particularly deep learning, with physics theory to understand and predict complex natural phenomena. By incorporating physical knowledge, SciML reduces the dependency on observational data, which is often limited in the natural sciences. In this article, the fundamental concepts of SciML, its applications in seismology, and prospects are described. Specifically, two popular methods are mainly discussed: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). PINNs can address both forward and inverse problems by incorporating governing laws into the loss functions. The use of PINNs is expanding into areas such as simultaneous solutions of differential equations, inference in underdetermined systems, and regularization based on physics. These research directions would broaden the scope of deep learning in natural sciences. NOs are models designed for operator learning, which deals with relationships between infinite-dimensional spaces. NOs show promise in modeling the time evolution of complex systems based on observational or simulation data. Since large amounts of data are often required, combining NOs with physics-informed learning holds significant potential. Finally, SciML is considered from a broader perspective beyond deep learning: statistical (or mathematical) frameworks that integrate observational data with physical principles to model natural phenomena. In seismology, mathematically rigorous Bayesian statistics has been developed over the past decades, whereas more flexible and scalable deep learning has only emerged recently. Both approaches can be considered as part of SciML in a broad sense. Theoretical and practical insights in both directions would advance SciML methodologies and thereby deepen our understanding of earthquake phenomena.</description>

      <title>Appropriateness of the McNamara and Buland's (2004) methodology for computing frequency-dependent seismic power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The methodology developed by McNamara and Buland (2004) for computing Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) has gained popularity due to its low computational cost and reduction of spectral variance. This methodology is widely used in seismic noise studies and station performance evaluations and is implemented in tools like ISPAQ, MUSTANG, and PQLX. However, concerns have been raised about its appropriateness in certain contexts, particularly when high-resolution spectral detail is required. This study evaluates McNamara and Buland's methodology by comparing it with Welch's method across three Alaskan stations with differing microseism conditions. When calculating seismic power across a band of frequencies--for example, the 5-10s secondary microseism--we find that both methodologies produce time series with nearly identical trends, albeit with slight differences in absolute power values. Our results demonstrate that McNamara and Buland's methodology is fully appropriate for certain applications, specifically ones that rely on averaged seismic energy over a frequency band as opposed to a single discrete frequency.</description>
