      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>

      <title>Multimagnon and multispinon $L_3$-edge RIXS spectra of an effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multimagnon and the multispinon $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a spin-1/2 effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model in its N\'{e}el ordered phase. Motivated by the observation of satellite intensity peaks above the single magnon dispersion in the $L$-edge RIXS spectrum, we propose a resonating valence bond (RVB) inspired RIXS mechanism that incorporates the local site ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion. We compute the multimagnon and the multispinon excitations using $\mathcal{O}(1/S)$ interacting spin wave theory and Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) formalism, respectively. We treat the x-ray scattering process up to second order in the UCL expansion. Our calculations of two-magnon, bimagnon, and three-magnon RIXS intensities reveal that interacting spin wave theory fails to fully capture all the quantum correlations in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase. However utilizing the SBMFT framework, with a ground state that combines N\'{e}el order and fluctuating RVB components, we demonstrate that a RIXS bond-flipping mechanism provides an alternative deeper physical explanation of the satellite intensities. Specifically, we find that the spin correlation spectra predicted by the fluctuating RVB mechanism aligns with higher order UCL expansion results. We further show that the satellite intensity above the single-magnon mode can originate both from a one-to-three-magnon hybridization vertex process and from condensed spinons exhibiting Higgs mechanism. These features reflect the interplay of quantum fluctuation, entanglement, and gauge interaction effects of quantum magnetism probed by RIXS.</description>

      <title>Helicons in multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three dimension(3D) electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. This modes have been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(sWSMs) (Francesco M.D. Pellegrino et al, Phys. Rev. B 92, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate helicons modes in gapless multi-Weyl semimetals(mWSMs) within semiclassical Boltzmann approach and discuss the differences that arise compared to single Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This elementary review article is aimed to the beginning graduate students interested to know basic aspects of Kitaev model. We begin with a very lucid introduction of Kitaev model and present its exact solution, Hilbert space structure, fractionalisation, spin-spin correlation function and topological degeneracy in an elementary way. We then discuss the recent proposal of realizing Kitaev interaction in certain materials. Finally we present some recent experiments done on these materials, mainly magnetization, susceptibility, specific heat and thermal Hall effect to elucidate the recent status of material realization of coveted Kitaev spin-liquid phase. We end with a brief discussion on other theoretical works on Kitaev model from different many-body aspects.</description>

      <title>Criticality and magnetic phases of Ising Shastry-Sutherland candidate holmium tetraboride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetic systems arising in geometrically constrained lattices represent rich platforms for exploring unconventional phases of matter, including fractional magnetization plateaus, incommensurate orders, and complex domain dynamics. However, determining the microscopic spin configurations that stabilize such phases is a key challenge, especially when in-plane and out-of-plane spin components coexist and compete. Here, we combine neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility experiments with simulations to investigate the emergence of field-induced fractional plateaus and the related criticality in a frustrated magnet holmium tetraboride (HoB4) that represents the family of rare earth tetraborides that crystalize in a Shastry-Sutherland lattice in the ab plane. We focus on the interplay between classical and quantum criticality near phase boundaries as well as the role of material defects in the stabilization of the ordered phases. We find that simulations using classical annealing can explain certain observed features in the experimental Laue diffraction and the origin of multiple magnetization plateaus. Our results show that defects and out of plane interactions play an important role and can guide the route towards resolving microscopic spin textures in highly frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Electronic dimensionality of UTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</description>

      <title>Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We show that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, results for the sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumable transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications for the scenario of subdiffusive transport, in particular in the dynamical diffusivity response.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of quantum dots embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm ring: a Pauli master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within linear response theory using Pauli master equation approach, we have investigated the thermoelectric properties of quantum dots (QDs) embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes. This study explores the impact of magnetic flux on thermoelectric transport, emphasizing the role of quantum interference induced by the flux. When the magnetic flux is varied from 0 to one quantum of flux $\Phi = \Phi_{0} = \frac{h}{e}$, both the electrical conductance and the thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$) significantly increase by two order of magnitude. Moreover, our investigation into the effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions in this nanojunction indicates that an optimal $ZT$ is attained with moderate onsite Coulomb interaction and minimal inter-site Coulomb interaction. We briefly discussed the effects of asymmetric arrangements of triple QDs within an AB ring. However, within our parameter regime, a symmetric arrangement offers superior thermoelectric performance compared to asymmetric configurations. Furthermore, we explored how increasing the number of QDs in the ring enhances the thermoelectric properties, resulting in a potential $ZT$ value of around $0.43$. This study shows that arranging multiple QDs symmetrically in an AB ring can result in significant thermoelectric performance in nanostructured system at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$: A Promising Kagome Antiferromagnetic Candidate for Room-Temperature Nernst Effect-based thermoelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nernst effect, the generation of a transverse electric voltage in the presence of longitudinal thermal gradient, has garnered significant attention in the realm of magnetic topological materials due to its superior potential for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we investigate electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of a Kagome magnet ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$, a compound showing an incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase followed by a ferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling. We show that in the antiferromagnetic phase ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits both topological Nernst effect and anomalous Nernst effect, analogous to the electric Hall effects, with the Nernst coefficient reaching 1.71 uV/K at 300 K and 3 T. This value surpasses that of most of previously reported state-of-the-art canted antiferromagnetic materials and is comparable to recently reported other members of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) compounds, which makes ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ a promising candidate for advancing the development of Nernst effect-based thermoelectric devices.</description>

Abstract: In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an infinite Wilson line in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the appropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in $N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.</description>

      <title>Electric transport in doped Mott insulators dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the ``confinement'' of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $ \delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.</description>

      <title>Topological orders with classical Lie group symmetries from coupling electron wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological order that arises from chiral states with ${\rm SU}(N)$ or ${\rm SO}(N)$ edge-state symmetry. This extends our previous study of topological orders that descend from the bosonic $E_8$ quantum Hall state. We use exactly solvable models of coupled electron wires to construct states with ${\rm SU}(m)_n$, ${\rm SO}(m)_n$, or ${\rm Sp}(m)_n$ topological order for various levels $n$. We use our constructions to write down string operators for various non-Abelian anyons. We thereby provide a systematic, model derivation of quantum Hall states, topological superconductors, and spin liquids with emergent non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations, including those of Ising, metaplectic, and Fibonacci type.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>$t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying use cases with superconducting circuits not critically affected by the inherent noise is a pertinent challenge. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrable effects in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling the system's qubits to ancillary ones that are periodically reset. We compare the digital reset protocol to the usual Lindblad continuous-time evolution by considering non-interacting integrable systems dynamics, which can be analyzed using scattering between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles caused by the dissipation. If not dominant, the inherent noise would cause extra scattering but would not critically change the physics. A corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of stabilizing exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of Tc for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal Tc. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moir\'e patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>
