      <title>Anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces in a wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Minkowski formulae and a Heintze-Karcher type inequality for anisotropic hypersurfaces in a classical wedge in Euclidean space. As an application, we prove an Alexandrov-type theorem. This extends the results in \cite{JWXZ} to the anisotropic case.</description>

      <title>Splitting maps in Type I Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and small scale behaviour of almost splitting maps along a Ricci flow satisfying Type I curvature bounds. These are special solutions of the heat equation that serve as parabolic analogues of harmonic almost splitting maps, which have proven to be an indespensable tool in the study of the structure of the singular set of non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces.
  In this paper, motivated by the recent work of Cheeger-Jiang-Naber in the Ricci limit setting, we construct sharp splitting maps on Ricci flows that are almost selfsimilar, and then investigate their small scale behaviour. We show that, modulo linear transformations, an almost splitting map at a large scale remains a splitting map even at smaller scales, provided that the Ricci flow remains sufficiently self-similar. Allowing these linear transformations means that a priori an almost splitting map might degenerate at small scales. However, we show that under an additional summability hypothesis such degeneration doesn't occur.</description>

      <title>Designing Poisson Integrators Through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general method to construct Poisson integrators, i.e., integrators that preserve the underlying Poisson geometry. We assume the Poisson manifold is integrable, meaning there is a known local symplectic groupoid for which the Poisson manifold serves as the set of units. Our constructions build upon the correspondence between Poisson diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian bisections, which allows us to reformulate the design of Poisson integrators as solutions to a certain PDE (Hamilton-Jacobi). The main novelty of this work is to understand the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE as an optimization problem, whose solution can be easily approximated using machine learning related techniques. This research direction aligns with the current trend in the PDE and machine learning communities, as initiated by Physics- Informed Neural Networks, advocating for designs that combine both physical modeling (the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE) and data.</description>

      <title>Nodal Volumes as Differentiable Functionals of Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the absolute continuity of the law and the Malliavin-Sobolev regularity of random nodal volumes associated with smooth Gaussian fields on generic $\mathcal{C}^2$ manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Our results extend and generalize the seminal contribution by Angst and Poly (2020) about stationary fields on Euclidean spaces and cover, in particular, the case of two-dimensional manifolds, possibly with boundary and corners. The main tools exploited in the proofs include the use of Gaussian measures on Banach spaces, Morse theory, and the characterization of Malliavin-Sobolev spaces in terms of ray absolute continuity. Several examples are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Minimizing movements for the generalized power mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of De Giorgi, we consider the Almgren-Taylor-Wang scheme for mean curvature flow, where the volume penalization is replaced by a term of the form \[ \int_{E\Delta F} f\Big(\frac{ {\rm d}_F }{\tau}\Big)~dx \] for $f$ ranging in a large class of strictly increasing continuous functions. In particular, our analysis covers the case \[ f(r) = r^\alpha, \qquad r \geq 0, \quad \alpha&gt;0, \] considered by De Giorgi. We show that the generalized minimizing movement scheme converges to the geometric evolution equation \[ f(v) = - \kappa\quad \text{on $\partial E(t)$,} \] where $\{E(t)\}$ are evolving subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n,$ $v$ is the normal velocity of $\partial E(t),$ and $\kappa$ is the mean curvature of $\partial E(t)$. We extend our analysis to the anisotropic setting, and in the presence of a driving force. We also show that minimizing movements coincide with the smooth classical solution as long as the latter exists. Finally, we prove that in the absence of forcing, mean convexity and convexity are preserved by the weak flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.06959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the coarse index class with support condition (as an element of coarse $K$-homology) of an equivariant Dirac operator on a complete Riemannian manifold endowed with a proper, isometric action of a group. We further show a coarse relative index theorem and discuss the compatibility of the index with the suspension isomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the Convexity of General Inverse $\sigma_k$ Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a level set of a degree $n$ general inverse $\sigma_k$ equation $f(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n) = \lambda_1 \cdots \lambda_n - \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} c_k \sigma_k(\lambda) = 0$ is contained in $q + \Gamma_n$ for some $q \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $c_k$ are real numbers not necessary to be non-negative and $\Gamma_n$ is the positive orthant, then this level set is convex. As an application, this result justifies the convexity of the level set of all general inverse $\sigma_k$ type equations, for example, the Monge--Amp\`ere equation, the Hessian equation, the J-equation, the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills equation, the special Lagrangian equation, etc. Moreover, we find a numerical condition to verify whether a level set of a general inverse $\sigma_k$ equation is contained in $q + \Gamma_n$ for some $q \in \mathbb{R}^n$, which is a way to determine the convexity of this level set.</description>

Abstract: We present a formula for the signed area of a spherical polygon via prequantization. In contrast to the traditional formula based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that requires measuring angles, the new formula mimics Green's theorem and is applicable to a wider range of degenerate spherical curves and polygons.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Morphisms on Lie groups and Minimal Conformal Foliations of Codimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant semi-Riemannian metric. Let K be a semisimple subgroup of G generating a left-invariant conformal foliation F of codimension two on G. We then show that the foliation F is minimal. This means that locally the leaves of F are fibres of a complex-valued harmonic morphism. In the Riemannian case, we prove that if the metric restricted to K is biinvariant then F is totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Classification results for Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper:
  1. We give a complete classification of Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALF/AF gravitational instantons. This confirms a conjecture by Aksteiner-Andersson.
  2. We also show that such gravitational instantons can be compactified to toric log del Pezzo surfaces. This explains a curious relation between Hermitian non-K\"ahler ALF/AF gravitational instantons and compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds.
  3. We prove the non-existence of ALG and ALH type Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instantons.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds which are like a coadjoint orbit of $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$ with a Hamiltionan circle action. Then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. Recent works study the case when the fixed point set consists of precisely $n+1$ isolated points. Motivated by these works, this paper studies a Hamiltonian $S^1$ action on a $10$-dimensional compact symplectic manifold with exactly 6 isolated fixed points. Under a condition, we study the relations of the following data: the first Chern class of the manifold,the largest weight of the action, all the weights of the action,the total Chern class of the manifold, and the integral cohomology ring of the manifold. We show that if one of these data is identical with that of a coadjoint orbit of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a subcircle of the maximal torus, then the other data are identical with this coadjoint orbit of $G_2$.</description>
