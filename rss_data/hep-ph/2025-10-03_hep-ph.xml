      <title>Enhanced Matter Power Spectrum from Axion Kination after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite stringent constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, it is still possible for well-motivated particle physics models to substantially alter the cosmic expansion history between BBN and recombination. In this work we consider two different axion models that can realize a period of first matter domination, then kination, in this epoch. We perform fits to both primordial element abundances as well as CMB data and determine that up to a decade of late axion domination is allowed by these probes of the early universe. We establish the implications of late axion domination for the matter power spectrum on the scales $1/\mathrm{Mpc}\lesssim k \lesssim 10^3/$Mpc. Our 'log' model predicts a relatively modest bump-like feature together with a small suppression relative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions on either side of the enhancement. Our 'two-field' model predicts a larger, plateau-like feature that realizes enhancements to the matter power spectrum of up to two orders of magnitude. These features have interesting implications for structure formation at the forefront of current detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Robust bounds on MACHOs from the faintest galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to set limits on Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). In our analysis we study the robustness of the bounds under uncertainties in key UFD parameters, such as the half-light radius, stellar velocity dispersion, total halo mass and dark matter and stellar density profiles. We apply this framework to both well-established UFD candidates, as well as the recently discovered UFD candidate Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. We find that multiple UFDs yield consistently strong limits in the mass range $10\, M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^9\, M_\odot$, underscoring the robustness of a previous analysis solely based on Segue I. We also demonstrate that Ursa Major III, if confirmed as an UFD, would improve the constraints significantly, providing the strongest constraints on MACHO dark matter in the mass range $1\, M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^5\, M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Suppressed Ultraviolet Freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the dark matter mass $m$ exceed the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} &lt; m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.</description>

      <title>Updated Running Quark and Lepton Parameters at Various Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light of the recent Particle Data Group (PDG) release, we revisit the running quark and lepton Yukawa couplings, together with the quark mixing parameters, across a range of energy scales. The 2024 PDG determinations of low-energy fermion masses feature significantly smaller uncertainties, resulting from a reduced estimate of systematic errors compared to the more conservative treatment in the 2022 analysis. To assess the impact of these changes, we present running parameters obtained using both the 2022 and 2024 datasets, within the frameworks of the Standard Model (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM). The evolved values, along with their associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties, are given within the SM framework at benchmark scales of $M_Z$ and $10^3$, $3\cdot 10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$, $10^7$, $10^9$, $10^{12}$, and $10^{16}$ GeV. Within the MSSM, we additionally provide GUT-scale results for different choices of $\tan\beta$, assuming supersymmetry breaking scales of 3 and 10 TeV, including an approximate way for taking supersymmetric loop threshold corrections into account. We furthermore discuss implications of the updated results for constructing and testing theories beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Dark Drag Around Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of Dark Matter (DM) - Standard Model (SM) non-gravitational interactions on the orbital dynamics of celestial bodies near the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, where the DM density is generically expected to be high. We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of bottom baryons $\Omega^{(*)}_{b}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of bottom baryons $\Omega^{*}_{b}$ and $\Omega_{b}$ within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In the semileptonic sector, the $\Omega^{*}_b\rightarrow\Omega_c\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $\Omega_b\rightarrow\Omega^*_c\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transitions are specifically considered. Utilizing the operator product expansion up to dimension six, the responsible form factors of these decays are obtained. The acquired form factors enable us to determine the decay widths in three leptonic channels. Branching ratios related to the $\Omega_{b}$ baryon semileptonic decays are also presented. These invariant form factors are subsequently employed as inputs to determine the nonleptonic weak decay widths in various modes with emitting a pseudoscalar or vector meson. An extensive investigation into all possible decay channels of bottom baryons provides valuable information for future experiments to examine the SM predictions, explores the new physics effects in heavy baryonic decays, and advances the understanding of the internal structure of heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Hadron resonance gas is not a good model for hadronic matter in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of magnetic field on particle yields and charge fluctuations in hadron resonance gas. We argue that the big changes in the proton yield and baryon number susceptibility are due to ill-defined description of higher-spin states, and that because of detailed balance, neutral resonances must be affected by the field too.</description>

      <title>Singly heavy tetraquark resonant states with multiple strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the S-wave singly heavy tetraquark systems containing two or three strange quarks, $Qs\bar{s}\bar{s}$, $Qn\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $Qs\bar{s}\bar{n}\left( Q=c,b,n=u,d \right) $, within the constituent quark potential model. We solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation using the Gaussian expansion method (GEM) and identify resonances via the complex scaling method (CSM). There are no bound states below the lowest two-meson thresholds. We obtain several compact resonances with $J^P=0^+,2^+$ in $Qs\bar{s}\bar{s}$, and $J^P=2^+$ in $Qn\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $Qs\bar{s}\bar{n}$. The pole positions are mainly distributed around $7.0-7.2$ GeV (bottom) and $3.7-3.9$ GeV (charm), with widths from a few to several tens of MeV. These resonances decay into $D_s\eta ^\prime ,{D_{(s)}^*}\phi ,{D_s}^*K^*$ and $D_s^*\bar{K}^*$ (and their bottom counterparts), providing targets for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Coupled-Channel Dynamics of $T_{c\bar{s}}$ in $D_{s1}(2460/2536)\to D_s\pi\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $T_{c\bar{s}}$ state observed in the decay $D_{s1}(2460)^+ \to D_s^+\pi^+\pi^-$ provides direct evidence for an isovector open-charm tetraquark state with strangeness. We develop a unified theoretical framework that consistently incorporates triangle loops and $DK$-$D_s\pi$ rescattering. Especially, $DK$-$D_s\pi$ coupled-channel interactions through off-diagonal potential terms provide a novel perspective on the origin of the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ pole. Based on the systematic description of the $D_{s1}$ mass spectrum, the two-peak structure in $D_{s1}(2460)$ decay is perfectly reproduced, and explained by the interference of the $f_0$ resonance and rescattering diagrams. In contrast, only one-peak structure is predicted in $D_{s1}(2536)$ decay, since it is dominated by rescattering only. This difference originates from the $S$- and $D$-wave dominance for $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ coupling with $D^*K$ channel, respectively, which reflects the internal structures of the two $D_{s1}$ states. This unified approach demonstrates how decay and production mechanisms encode different aspects of dynamics, offering an opportunity to disentangle the nature of exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity for Triple Higgs Boson Searches with Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using two benchmark models containing extended scalar sectors beyond the Standard Model, we study deep learning techniques to enhance the sensitivity of resonant triple Higgs boson searches in the fully hadronic $6b$ channel, which suffers from the combinatorial challenge of reconstructing the Higgs bosons correctly from the multiple $b$-jets. More specifically, we employ the framework of Symmetry Preserving Attention Network (\textsc{Spa-Net}), which takes into account the permutational symmetry when a correct pairing of $b$-jets is achieved, to tackle both jet pairing and event classification. Significantly improved efficiency is achieved in signal and background discrimination. When comparing with the conventional Dense Neural Networks, \textsc{Spa-Net} results in up to 40\% more stringent limits on resonant production cross-sections. These results highlight the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques to significantly improve the sensitivity of triple Higgs boson searches in the fully hadronic channel.</description>

      <title>GUT-motivated non-invertible symmetry as a solution to the strong CP problem and the neutrino CP-violating phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unsuppressed CP violation in QCD is a problem in the standard model. If we have some mechanism to guarantee real determinants of the quark mass matrices, the vanishing physical vacuum angle $\bar \theta$ indicates the CP invariance at the fundamental level. Thus, the small ${\bar \theta}$ is technically natural, since we have an enhanced CP symmetry in the limit of the vanishing $\bar \theta =0$. In fact, it was proved that the vacuum angle is never renormalized up to the four-loop level once it is fixed at 0 value at some high energy scale. The purpose of this paper is to construct a model which guarantees the real determinants of the quark mass matrices assuming a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Addressing the sign-problem in Euclidean path integrals with radial basis function neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving interacting field theories at finite densities remains a numerically and conceptually challenging task, even with modern computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QCD amplitudes for $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The associated production of a photon and a top-antitop quark pair ($t\bar{t}\gamma$) is important for measuring the top-quark charge and probing the top-photon interaction, and it requires improved theoretical predictions. We focus on the calculation of two-loop amplitudes for $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production at hadron colliders. The infrared singularities with full top-quark mass dependence are derived from universal anomalous dimensions combined with one-loop massive amplitudes expanded to higher orders in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. The finite remainders are approximated in the high-energy boosted limit using the mass-factorization formula. To validate our approach, we compare approximate one-loop amplitudes up to $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^2\right)$, as well as the two-loop infrared poles, against our exact results. The results in this paper serve as an important step toward next-to-next-to-leading order predictions for $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production.</description>

      <title>Background Suppression in Quantum Sensing of Dark Matter via $W$ State Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors' state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors' decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis may be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

      <title>Resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter with a refined numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$\,keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations: foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the founding ideas of dispersion relations in particle physics. Starting from elementary mechanical systems, we show how the physical principle of causality is closely related to the mathematical property of analyticity, and how both are implemented in quantum mechanical scattering theory. We present a personal selection of elementary applications such as the relation between hadronic production amplitudes or form factors to scattering, and the extraction of resonance properties on unphysical Riemann sheets. More advanced topics such as Roy equations for pion--pion scattering and dispersion relations for three-body decays are briefly touched upon.</description>

      <title>Improved prediction of the mass splitting for $P$-wave $\Omega$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the QCD sum rule method, we investigate the mass splitting for the spin-orbit partner states of the $\Omega(2012)$ baryon assuming that it is a $P$-wave excitation with $J^P=3/2^-$. This study is an extension of the previous work [1] in which the masses of these states were estimated with uncertainties too large to extract the reliable mass splitting. In the present study, by directly formulating a sum rule for the mass splitting, we obtain an improved prediction, $\delta M = M_{3/2^-} - M_{1/2^-} = -18.0^{+ 33.6}_{-17.1}$ MeV. This result provides a more quantitative insight into the spectrum of $P$-wave $\Omega$ baryons and serves as a useful reference for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit basis set for pentaquark states on a regular 4-simplex, that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian for light pentaquarks with confinement on the light front (LF). The ensuing eigenstates are free of the center of mass motion and satisfy exact Dirichlet boundary conditions. Hyperfine interactions in the form of color-spin or flavor-spin are shown to lift the degeneracy of the 16 pentastates, with a spectrum that compares fairly with some of the empirical nucleon excited states. The quark PDF for the light pentastates is discussed.</description>

      <title>Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355&lt;=p&lt;=6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;= N&lt;=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated extending the superpotential of the model with suitable terms.</description>

      <title>Fully charm tetraquark production at hadronic collisions with gluon radiation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have completed the first complete next-to-leading order QCD calculation for the fully charm tetraquark state. By resumming over various gluon radiation effects, we have improved the precision of their hadroproduction cross-section to the order of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$. Through symmetry analysis, we investigated the possible quark configurations of the fully charm tetraquark and expanded its states in the color symmetry-antisymmetry basis. By combining LHCb data on the total cross section of the exotic hadron X(6900) and CMS measurements of its spin-parity, we extracted the non-perturbative but universal long-distance matrix elements. In the end, the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are predicted, which await further experimental verification.</description>

      <title>The Single-Mass Variable Flavor Number Scheme at Three-Loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching relations in the unpolarized and polarized variable flavor number scheme at three-loop order are presented in the single-mass case. They describe the process of massive quarks becoming light at large virtualities $Q^2$. In this framework, heavy-quark parton distributions can be defined. Numerical results are presented on the matching relations in the case of the single-mass variable flavor number scheme for the light parton, charm and bottom quark distributions. These relations are process independent. In the polarized case we generally work in the Larin scheme. To two-loop order we present the polarized massive OMEs also in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. Fast numerical codes for the single-mass massive operator matrix elements are provided.</description>

      <title>Parton distributions in the shockwave formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate a broad class of parton distributions - including parton distribution functions (PDFs), transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), generalized transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs), and diffractive parton distributions - directly from their operator-level definition in the shockwave approximation for the target nucleon. This approximation is valid in the high-energy limit of scattering, corresponding to the small-$x$ regime. The shockwave framework allows us to employ the eikonal approximation and express the parton distributions in terms of Wilson-line correlators, naturally formulated within the color-glass condensate effective field theory. We present a comprehensive set of Feynman rules for evaluating parton distributions in this limit, and demonstrate how they can be systematically applied to calculate all phenomenologically relevant leading-twist parton distributions at leading order. This work establishes a unified starting point for future studies that aim to bridge the color-glass condensate approach with the partonic description of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of an Electroweak $\etaw$ Pseudo-Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested that the spectrum of physical states in the Standard Model may include an ultralight pseudo-scalar, denoted by $\eta_w$, in analogy with the $\eta'$ state arising from the strong interactions. We find that typical expectations for the properties of $\eta_w$ get challenged by astrophysical constraints on the couplings of ultralight bosons. Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of O(1000 TeV) on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_w$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely. Given the important implications of a potentially overlooked $\eta_w$ state for a more complete understanding of the electroweak interactions and a fundamental description of Nature, further theoretical and phenomenological investigations of this possibility and its associated physics are warranted.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Secluded Dark Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark radiation (DR) is ubiquitous in physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and its interactions with the SM and dark matter (DM) lead to a variety of interesting effects on cosmological observables. However, even in scenarios where DR is 'secluded', i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM, it can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four different types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling, and recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary neutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to perform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR properties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant preference for physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit interesting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino energy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset prefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a significant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any evidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of the isocurvature power spectrum. Our analysis also highlights the degeneracy of various DR parameters with the Hubble constant $H_0$ resulting in a mild relaxation of the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>On Pre-Inflationary non Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the climbing phase, within the window 62&lt;N&lt;66 for the inflationary e-folds could be compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing Perturbers from the SIDM Concerto Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.</description>

      <title>BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension "no-go theorem", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</description>

      <title>Probing cold nuclear matter with energy correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future electron-ion collider (EIC) will produce the first-ever high energy collisions between electrons and a wide range of nuclei, opening a new era in the study of cold nuclear matter. Quarks and gluons produced in these collisions will propagate through the dense nuclear matter of nuclei, imprinting its structure into subtle correlations in the energy flux of final state hadrons. In this article, we apply recent developments from the field of jet substructure, namely the energy correlator observables, to decode these correlations and provide a new window into nuclear structure. The energy correlators provide a calibrated probe of the scale dependence of vacuum quantum chromodynamics (QCD), enabling medium modifications to be imaged and interpreted as a function of scale. Using the eHIJING parton shower to simulate electron-nucleus collisions, we demonstrate that the size of the nucleus is imprinted as an angular scale in the correlators, with a magnitude that is visible for realistic EIC kinematics. We can observe the size difference between the proposed EIC nuclear targets ${}^3$He, ${}^4$He, ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{40}$Ca, ${}^{64}$Cu, ${}^{197}$Au, and ${}^{238}$U, showing that the energy correlators can image femtometer length scales using asymptotic energy flux. Our approach offers a unified view of jet substructure across collider experiments, and provides numerous new theoretical tools to unravel the complex dynamics of QCD in extreme environments, both hot and cold.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs boson production and electroweak phase transition in the two-real-singlet model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons at hadron colliders can be enhanced by a double-resonant effect in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric two-real-singlet extension of the Standard Model, making it potentially observable in future LHC runs. The production rate is maximized for large scalar couplings, which prompts us to carefully reconsider the perturbativity constraints on the theory. This leads us to construct a new set of 140 benchmark points that have a triple Higgs boson production cross-section at least 100 times larger than the SM value. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition, both analytically at leading order, and numerically without the high-temperature expansion. Both analyses indicate that a first-order phase transition is incompatible with the requirement that both singlets have a non-zero vev in the present-day vacuum, as required by doubly-enhanced triple Higgs boson production. Allowing instead one of the singlets to remain at zero field value opens up the possibility of a first-order phase transition, while di-Higgs boson production can still be enhanced by a (single) resonance.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as test for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-thermal resonant leptogenesis in a general setting where a heavy majoron $\phi$ decays to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) whose further out-of-equilibrium decay generates the required lepton asymmetry. Domination of the energy budget of the Universe by the $\phi$ or the RHNs alters the evolution history of the primordial gravitational waves (PGW) of inflationary origin, which re-enter the horizon after inflation, modifying the spectral shape. The decays of $\phi$ and RHNs release entropy into the early Universe while nearly degenerate RHNs facilitate low and intermediate-scale leptogenesis. A characteristic damping of the GW spectrum resulting in knee-like features would provide evidence for low-scale non-thermal leptogenesis. We explore the parameter space for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1\in[10^2,10^{14}]$ GeV and washout parameter $K$ that depends on the light-heavy neutrino Yukawa couplings $\lambda$, in the weak ($K &lt; 1$) and strong ($K &gt; 1$) washout regimes. The resulting novel features compatible with observed baryon asymmetry are detectable by future experiments like LISA and ET. By estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for upcoming GW experiments, we investigate the effect of the majoron mass $M_\phi$ and reheating temperature $T_\phi$, which depends on the $\phi-N$ Yukawa couplings $y_N$.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Dark Scalar Phase Transitions explanation of NANOGrav data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence of a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range is posed to open a new window on the Universe. A preferred explanation relies on a supercooled first order phase transition at the 100 MeV - GeV scale. In this article, we address the feasibility going from the particle physics model to the production of the gravitational waves. We take a minimal approach for the dark sector model introducing the fewest ingredients required, namely a new U(1) gauge group and a dark scalar that dynamically breaks the symmetry. Supercooling poses challenges in the analysis that put under question the feasibility of this explanation: we address them, going beyond previous studies by carefully considering the effects of a vacuum domination phase and explicitly tracking the phase transition from its onset to its completion. We find that the proposed model can successfully give origin to the observed PTA SGWB signal. The strong supercooling imposes a correlation between the new gauge coupling and the scalar quartic one, leading to a significant hierarchy between the (heavier) gauge boson and the dark scalar. Ultimately, information on phase transitions from SGWB observations could provide a direct probe of the microphysics of the Early Universe and be used to guide future searches of dark sector in laboratories.</description>

Abstract: We study the complementarity between COHERENT and LHC searches in testing neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSIs) through the completion of the effective field theory approach within a $Z'$ simplified model. Our results show that LHC bounds are strongly dependent on the $Z'$ mass, with relatively large masses excluding regions in the parameter space that are allowed by COHERENT data and its future expectations. We demonstrate that the combination of low- and high-energy experiments results in a viable approach to break NSI degeneracies within the context of simplified models.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from cosmological CP breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that baryogenesis can arise from the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that governs CP-violating parameters, such as the Yukawa couplings and the theta terms of the Standard Model. During the big bang, this scalar may reach a CP-violating minimum, where its mass can be comparable to the inflationary Hubble scale. Such dynamics can emerge in theories featuring either a spontaneously broken local U(1) symmetry or modular invariance. The latter arises naturally as the effective field theory capturing the geometric origin of CP violation in toroidal string compactifications. Modular baryogenesis is compatible with the modular approach to resolving the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-Violating Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings at Electron-Positron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the CP-violating (CPV) neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) that can be realized via dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We present a new formulation of the CPV nTGC form factors that is compatible with spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry, and show how these CPV form factors can be matched consistently with the corresponding dimension-8 CPV nTGC operators in the broken phase. We then study probes of the CPV nTGCs at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=(0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5)$TeV respectively, demonstrating that the $e^{\mp}$ beam polarizations can help to improve the sensitivities of probes of the nTGCs. We estimate that the sensitivity reaches for probing the new physics scales of nTGCs can range from ${O}(\rm{TeV})$ at a 250GeV $e^+e^-$ collider to ${O}(10\,\rm{TeV})$ at an $e^+e^-$ collider of energy $(3-5)$TeV, and that the sensitivities to the nTGC form factors vary from ${O}(10^{-4})$ to ${O}(10^{-6}-10^{-8})$ for the $e^+e^-$ collision energy from 250GeV to $(3-5)$TeV.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed (bottom) baryons to single heavy baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>

      <title>Chiral interactions, chiral states and "chiral neutrino oscillations"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In vacuum the ``chiral neutrino oscillations'', i.e. the periodic transitions between the left- and right-handed states do not occur. The produced state differs from the chiral component that appear in the Lagrangian of interactions and should be computed for each specific process. The phase difference between components of a produced neutrino is space-time independent. This neutrino state consists of only positive energy solutions of the Dirac equation and therefore the energy splitting $2E_\nu$ between the components with different helicities that would drive the chiral oscillations does not exist. Consideration in terms of neutrino propagators leads to the same conclusion. The situation is similar for the Majorana neutrinos and in the presence of flavor mixing. However, oscillations of the neutrino states produced in the chiral interactions are possible in matter with the length determined by the matter potential. Description of oscillations in terms of amplitudes of production and detection is elaborated that does not lead to any misconception. In the expanding Universe the relic neutrinos adiabatically convert to equal number densities of the left and right handed components.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and dark radiation from chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simple model of a dark sector with a chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. The anomaly-free condition requires at least five chiral fermions. Some of the fermions acquire masses through a vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field, and they are stable due to an accidental symmetry. This makes them dark matter candidates. If the dark sector was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model and dark radiation constraints are included, two-component dark matter may be needed since the number of massless fermions is restricted. When the Dirac fermion is the main component of dark matter, the kinetic mixing should be around $10^{-6}$: a larger value is restricted by direct detection limits, while a smaller value prevents thermal freeze-out. If the main dark matter component is a Majorana fermion, the kinetic mixing can be larger. Still, a sub-component of Dirac fermion could produce a detectable signal in future direct detection experiments. We also discuss the possibility of testing an invisible dark photon at future lepton collider experiments, taking into account cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Joint analysis of reactor and accelerator CE$\nu$NS data on germanium: implications for the Standard Model and nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first comprehensive joint analysis of all available Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data on germanium: those observed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) by the COHERENT collaboration and those of the nuclear reactors revealed by the CONUS+ experiment using germanium detectors. In addition to COHERENT and CONUS+, we incorporate reactor data from TEXONO and $\nu$GeN, thereby enhancing both the statistical significance and the systematic reliability of our study. We provide state-of-the-art determinations of key nuclear physics and Standard Model parameters, including the neutron root-mean-square (rms) radius of germanium nuclei, the weak mixing angle, and the neutrino charge radius. The observed tension of about $2 \sigma$ between the COHERENT germanium measurement and the Standard Model prediction motivates a detailed reassessment of the theoretical cross-section. In particular, we examine the impact of nuclear form factors and uncertainties in the nuclear radius, as well as the potential influence of a systematic shift in the neutrino flux normalisation at the SNS. Our results highlight the reliability of CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool, reinforced by the complementarity of different experimental inputs, and lay the groundwork for future advances in the field.</description>

      <title>Mapping the evolution of supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter within the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) has emerged as a promising portal for probing sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we investigate the behavior of BDM signatures originating from core-collapse supernovae within the Milky Way (MW) over the past one hundred thousand years, examining both their temporal evolution and present-day spatial distributions. We show that while the MW BDM signature is approximately diffuse in the nonrelativistic regime, it exhibits significant temporal variation and spatial localization when the BDM is relativistic. Importantly, we compare these local MW signatures with the previously proposed diffuse SN$\nu$ BDM (DBDM), which arises from the accumulated flux of all past supernovae in the Universe [Y.-H. Lin and M.-R. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 111004 (2024)]. In the nonrelativistic limit, DBDM consistently dominates over the local diffuse MW BDM signature. Only when the MW BDM becomes ultrarelativistic and transitions into a transient, highly-localized signal can it potentially surpass the DBDM background. This work thus reinforces the importance of DBDM for SN$\nu$ BDM searches until the next galactic SN offers new opportunities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter is a compelling setup that has been probed by a multitude of experiments, mostly in the GeV-TeV mass range. The thermal paradigm in the sub-GeV range is about to experience the same experimental test with the next generation of low-energy accelerators and light dark matter detectors. Motivated by this, we investigate thermal dark matter in the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ and assess how the introduction of a matter-dominated era impacts the parameter that yields the correct relic density. Interestingly, we show that the projected experiments, such as MuSIC, FCC-ee, and LDMX, will probe a large region of the viable parameter space that yields the correct relic density. In the GeV-TeV mass regime, the usual large-scale detectors push the sensitivity. Our work highlights the rich interplay between early-universe dynamics, dark matter phenomenology, and the discovery potential of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Is the $3S$-$2D$ mixing strong for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the $3S$-$2D$ mixing scheme for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We introduce a coupled-channel mechanism-distinct from the tensor-force contribution in potential models, which alone is insufficient to induce significant mixing-to describe the mixing between these states. Our analysis yields mixing angles of $\theta_1=7^\circ$ and $\theta_2=10^\circ$, inconsistent with the larger angle inferred from experimental data, such as the di-lectronic widths of the $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy and emphasize the need for future experiments to resolve it. Precise measurements of the resonance parameters and di-lectronic decay widths, via both inclusive and exclusive processes, will be crucial in clarifying this issue.</description>

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision, especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.</description>

Abstract: In a series of $\sim 30$ papers starting in 1991, it has been claimed that the Higgs field should be heavier than its now-measured value. To reconcile this idea with reality, it was modified to the assertion that the Higgs field describes two physical degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to a second Higgs particle with mass 690 GeV. Here I summarize the lack of theoretical and experimental evidence for these claims.</description>

      <title>Efficient tau-pair invariant mass reconstruction with simplified matrix element techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).</description>

      <title>Anomalies in String-inspired Non-local Extensions of QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalies in the class of non-local field theories that have been proposed as an ultraviolet completion of 4-D Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with generalizing the kinetic energy operators to an infinite series of higher derivatives inspired by string field theory and ghost-free non-local approaches to quantum gravity. We explicitly calculate the vector and chiral anomalies in a string-inspired non-local extension of QED. We show that the vector anomaly vanishes as required by gauge-invariance and the Ward identity. On the other hand, although the chiral anomaly vanishes to the leading order with massless fermions, it nonetheless does not vanish with the massive fermions and we calculate it to the leading order in scale of non-locality. We also calculate the non-local vector and axial currents explicitly, and present an illustrative example by applying our results to the decay of \pi_0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma.</description>

      <title>Nuclear cluster structure effect in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at the top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the improved AMPT-SM model, we investigated the impact of nuclear geometry of $^{16}$O on anisotropic flows in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=200$ GeV. To evaluate the influence of nuclear structure and potential alpha clustering, we implemented four candidate configurations: Woods-Saxon, tetrahedron, square, and NLEFT. Initial-state geometry is quantified via the eccentricity cumulant ratio $\varepsilon_{2}\{4\}/\varepsilon_{2}\{2\}$, which provides a robust and evolution-independent measure sensitive to configuration differences. The model reproduces $v_{2}(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $v_{3}(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ across the full $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range, with integrated $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ matching the STAR data, demonstrating that transport dynamics captures the essential collectivity in this intermediate-size system. These findings establish a baseline for extending nuclear-structure studies in O+O collisions to other energies and differential observables within a unified transport model framework.</description>

      <title>The three phases of self-gravitating scalar field ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that scalar field dark matter halos would contain solitonic cores -- spherically symmetric ground state configurations -- at their centers. This is especially interesting in the case of ultralight dark matter (ULDM), where the solitons sizes are on the order of galaxies. In this work, we show that the paradigm of a spherically symmetric soliton embedded in the center of each halo is not universally valid in a scenario with multiple interacting scalar fields. In particular, sufficiently strong repulsive interspecies interactions make the fields immiscible. In such models, the ground state configuration can fall into a number of different phases that depend on the fields' relative densities, masses, and interaction strengths. This raises the possibility that the inner regions of ULDM halos are more complex and diverse than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel chiral anomalous Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>

      <title>Looking for the {\gamma}-Ray Cascades of the KM3-230213A Neutrino Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme energy of the KM3-230213A event could transform our understanding of the most energetic sources in the Universe. However, it also reveals an inconsistency between the KM3NeT detection and strong IceCube constraints on the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. The most congruous explanation for the KM3NeT and IceCube data requires KM3-230213A to be produced by a (potentially transient) source fortuitously located in a region where the KM3NeT acceptance is maximized. In hadronic models of ultra-high-energy neutrino production, such a source would also produce a bright {\gamma}-ray signal, which would cascade to GeV--TeV energies due to interactions with extragalactic background light. We utilize the {\gamma}-Cascade package to model the spectrum, spatial extension, and time-delay of such a source, and scan a region surrounding the KM3NeT event to search for a consistent {\gamma}-ray signal. We find no convincing evidence for a comparable \textit{Fermi}-LAT source and place constraints on a combination of the source redshift and the intergalactic magnetic field strength between the source and Earth.</description>

      <title>Learnable cut flow for high energy physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22498v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance.

      <title>Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we investigate the GWs from strong PTs catalyzed by PBHs. We consider high PBH number densities, corresponding to asteroid-mass PBH dark matter (DM) when the GWs from FOPTs peak in the nanohertz band. We calculate the PBH-catalyzed FOPT GWs from both bubble collision GWs and scaler-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). We find that while low PBH number densities amplify the GW signals due to the formation of large bubbles, high PBH number densities suppress them, as the accelerated phase transition proceeds too rapidly. This suppression renders the signals unable to explain pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic signatures of unique nuclear structures in relativistic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most vital topics of today's high-energy nuclear physics is the investigation of the nuclear structure of the collided nuclei. Recent studies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shown that several observables, such as the collective flow and transverse-momentum correlations of the produced particles, can be sensitive to various nuclear structure and deformation parameters. Femtoscopy, another essential tool for investigating the space-time geometry of the matter created in nuclear collisions, has not yet been widely applied to such studies. Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT), in this Letter, it is demonstrated that the femtoscopic source parameters of pion pairs can also serve as a robust signal of unique nuclear structure. Through an analysis of $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne and $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 68.5 GeV, two collision systems especially relevant to the SMOG2 program of the LHCb experiment, it is shown that a deformed initial shape can significantly affect femtoscopic source parameters. This study highlights the importance of expanding the nuclear structure investigations to femtoscopic observables and serves as a baseline for numerous possible future studies in this new direction.</description>

      <title>Particle Spectra in the Integrated HydroKinetic Model at RHIC BES Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study light-hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-39$ GeV using an extended Integrated HydroKinetic Model (iHKMe). Focusing on transverse momentum spectra, we investigate the sensitivity to key model parameters, in particular the thermalization time scale. We consider two distinct equations of state: one featuring a crossover and the other a first-order phase transition. In both cases, thermalization begins shortly before full nuclear overlap and lasts approximately 1~fm/$c$ across all energies. Both equations of state provide a similarly good description of the soft particle momentum spectra once the other parameters are slightly adjusted. The most pronounced differences arise at the lower RHIC BES energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV, particularly in proton and kaon yields, reflecting their sensitivity to the freeze-out parameters.</description>

      <title>LDMX -- The Light Dark Matter eXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is an electron fixed-target experiment optimized to search for sub-GeV dark matter production through the missing momentum signature. LDMX is designed to operate in End Station A at SLAC, using an 8 GeV electron beam accelerated alongside the LCLS-II drive beam. The design of the apparatus is strongly motivated by the performance requirements of a high-rate missing momentum search and leverages detector technologies and designs from other experiments along with existing facilities at SLAC. LDMX will improve on previous results by up to three orders of magnitude, enabling broad sensitivity to dark sector scenarios including the dark matter interaction strengths motivated by freeze-out of MeV-GeV mass dark matter to the observed relic abundance. With hermetic forward coverage, LDMX also has sensitivity to visible signatures of dark sectors and provides a unique probe of electron-nuclear interactions important to interpreting data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. This report encompasses the technical design of the LDMX Detector, its simulated performance, and the physics capabilities of the experiment.</description>

      <title>An improved formula for Wigner function and spin polarization in a decoupling relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an upgraded formula for Wigner function and spin polarization of fermions emitted by a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the decoupling which improves the one obtained in refs. [1, 2] and used in numerical simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>
