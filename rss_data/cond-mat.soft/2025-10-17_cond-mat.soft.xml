      <title>Low-Power Temperature Control by Chiral Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low power consumption is critical for smart windows for temperature control and privacy. The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals exhibit strong coupling of the ferroelectric polarization with electric fields, making them promising candidates for energy-efficient electrochromic devices. Here we investigate the electrochromic properties of a room temperature chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal in films with in-plane electrodes, where the electric field is perpendicular to the helical axis. We demonstrate that smart windows based on this material can regulate interior temperatures within a 10 Celsius range using only 50 milliwatt per square meter specific power, achieving fifty percent larger temperature modulation and 50-100 times lower power consumption than polymer dispersed and polymer stabilized liquid crystal windows. These findings suggest that chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals offer a highly efficient approach for smart window applications, potentially surpassing existing electrochromic technologies in energy efficiency and thermal regulation.</description>

      <title>Vertical pullout of a non-spherical intruder from a granular medium: From system-wide response to avalanching around the intruder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intruder mechanics in a granular aggregate is a common subject in engineering and geotechnical applications. However, most studies are limited to spherical intruders or small displacement regimes up to the point of failure. In this work we investigate the vertical pullout of a plate-like intruder buried within a granular aggregate well past the point of failure. While we find the maximum resistance force to depend on the material properties, in the post failure regime the resistance force converges onto the same curve for all friction coefficients. Likewise, the effective geometry of the intruder will always develop the same conical shape on top of the plate, independent of the magnitude of friction, that remains unchanged during the pullout process once established. Further, between the intruder and the aggregate a natural hopper flow develops in which material is transported into the void below the intruder by discrete flow events.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal buckling makes active filaments polyfunctional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active filaments are a workhorse for propulsion and actuation across biology, soft robotics and mechanical metamaterials. However, artificial active rods suffer from limited robustness and adaptivity because they rely on external control, or are tethered to a substrate. Here we bypass these constraints by demonstrating that non-reciprocal interactions lead to large-scale unidirectional dynamics in free-standing slender structures. By coupling the bending modes of a buckled beam anti-symmetrically, we transform the multistable dynamics of elastic snap-through into persistent cycles of shape change. In contrast to the critical point underpinning beam buckling, this transition to self-snapping is mediated by a critical exceptional point, at which bending modes simultaneously become unstable and degenerate. Upon environmental perturbation, our active filaments exploit self-snapping for a range of functionality including crawling, digging and walking. Our work advances critical exceptional physics as a guiding principle for programming instabilities into functional active materials.</description>

      <title>Unifying Frictional Transients Reveals the Origin of Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frictional motion is harder to initiate than to sustain, as evident when pushing a heavy object. This disparity between static and kinetic friction drives instabilities and stick-slip dynamics in systems ranging from nanodevices and MEMS to squealing brakes, glaciers and tectonic faults, yet its origin and the transition mechanism remain poorly understood. Empirical rate-and-state friction laws predict that during the static-to-kinetic transition, friction increases for nanometer-per-second slip rates, but decreases for micrometers-per-second rates and above. These transients are believed to be associated with contact strengthening (aging) at static interfaces, although their physical basis is unclear and the crossover between regimes has never been observed directly. Here we show, through nanometer-resolution sliding experiments on macroscopic rough surfaces, that these transients are segments of a single, universal non-monotonic response whose peak defines static friction. We show that this behavior arises from mechanical reorganization of interlocking surface asperities under shear, fundamentally distinct from contact aging, which is governed by thermal molecular processes. We derive, from first principles and without invoking any empirical postulates, a differential equation that quantitatively captures the friction peak. These results unify frictional transients across scales and speeds, and establish a physics-based framework for understanding frictional instabilities and failure processes in engineering and geosciences.</description>

      <title>Grain volume distribution alters the critical phenomena in complex granular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The grain size distribution (GSD) plays an important role in the mechanical properties of amorphous disordered systems and complex granular materials. Varying GSD causes segregation issues and alters critical behaviors. This work used the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the rheological and critical behaviors of sheared granular flows with various GSDs. The results show that, while a unified rheological relation can be obtained, a characteristic length scale, which is associated with the contact probability and can be obtained from any GSD, is embedded within such a polydisperse disordered system. We further acquire a correlation function between critical solid fractions and dimensionless grain volume distributions. This work elucidates the effect of particle volumes on the rheology and micromechanics of dry granular systems and provides further insights in better incorporating the influence of other particle properties into a unified framework, which is helpful and critical for the corresponding engineering and geophysical problems.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy DNA Bubble Dynamics via the Quantum Coulomb Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a low-energy model that can be used at any time to describe the dynamics of DNA bubbles at temperatures below the melting point. The Schr\"odinger equation associated with this problem is solved in imaginary time with a quantum Coulomb potential, and we obtain an approximate expression for its more general physical solution as a linear combination of the states whose energies are close to the lower bound energy. We can then determine the probability density, the first-passage time density, and the correlation functions in terms of Bessel functions. Our findings are consistent with results obtained directly from the Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with the Gamma and Diffusion models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Living Capillary Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit complex behaviors with their dynamics often resembling inert soft matter such as liquids, polymers, colloids, and liquid crystals. These analogies enable physics-based approaches for investigations of emergent behaviors in biological processes. A well-studied case is the spreading of cellular aggregates on solid surfaces, where they display dynamics similar to viscous droplets. \textit{In vivo}, however, cells and tissues are in a confined environment with varying geometries and mechanical properties to which they need to adapt. In this work, we compressed cellular aggregates between two solid surfaces and studied their dynamics using microscopy, and computer simulations. The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from compressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge thinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that the stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth and cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge rupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the plates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living capillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that included cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how mechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular aggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and cell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we propose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates exhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized rupturing driven by biological activity.</description>

      <title>Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having the elastic strain relax while observing energy conservation and entropy production yields a model called hydrodynamics of transient elasticity (HoTE). It interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics and provides a broad framework for many systems such as polymers, granular media, thixotropic and yield-stress fluids. Focusing on the last two systems, this paper shows that, with little efforts at model sculpting, HoTE easily accounts for many effects, including: static and dynamic yield stress, over- and under-shoot of stresses at rate jumps, hysteresis at rate ramps and rate inversion, "viscosity bifurcation", acceleration on a tilted plane, shear band, elastic shear waves, aging and rejuvenation.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Run-and-Tumble-Like Dynamics in a Robotic Analog of \textit{Chlamydomonas}: Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. One such example is a biflagellated alga, called \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. Its flagellar synchronization is not only affected by hydrodynamic interactions but also through contractile stress fibers that mechanically couple the flagella, enabling adaptable swimming behavior. To explore this, we design a macroscopic mechanical system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model this organism. By varying the attachment points of the two ends of the rod on each robot, the model incorporates the effect of fiber contractility observed in the real organism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp, direction-reversing tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with the real organism. Moreover, we quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics. Thus, our robotic system not only replicates RT motion but also captures several subtle characteristics, offering valuable insights into the underlying physics of microswimmer motility.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Determining the optimal structural resolution of proteins through an information-theoretic analysis of their conformational ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08076v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of structural resolution is a fundamental aspect of protein modelling, determining the balance between descriptive power and interpretability. Although atomistic simulations provide maximal detail, much of this information is redundant to understand the relevant large-scale motions and conformational states. Here, we introduce an unsupervised, information-theoretic framework that determines the minimal number of atoms required to retain a maximally informative description of the configurational space sampled by a protein. This framework quantifies the informativeness of coarse-grained representations obtained by systematically decimating atomic degrees of freedom and evaluating the resulting clustering of sampled conformations. Application to molecular dynamics trajectories of dynamically diverse proteins shows that the optimal number of retained atoms scales linearly with system size, averaging about four heavy atoms per residue--remarkably consistent with the resolution of well-established coarse-grained models, such as MARTINI and SIRAH. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the optimal retained atoms number depends not only on molecular size but also on the extent of conformational exploration, decreasing for systems dominated by collective motions. The proposed method establishes a general criterion to identify the minimal structural detail that preserves the essential configurational information, thereby offering a new viewpoint on the structure-dynamics-function relationship in proteins and guiding the construction of parsimonious yet informative multiscale models.</description>
