      <title>From Cloud-Native to Trust-Native: A Protocol for Verifiable Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight, TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&amp;D, legal automation, and AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -&gt; AI -&gt; Agent -&gt; Trust transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Successor Features for Transfer in Alternating Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum, complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed EvolveGCN: Satellite Prediction for Multi Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion. This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations in multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Dynamic Uncontrollable Agents with Statistical Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers do not account for uncertain behavior of uncontrollable agents. We present a novel variant of Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS), for both one-shot and lifelong MAPF in dynamic environments with uncontrollable agents. Our method consists of (1) training a learned predictor for the movement of uncontrollable agents, (2) quantifying the prediction error using conformal prediction (CP), a tool for statistical uncertainty quantification, and (3) integrating these uncertainty intervals into our modified ECBS solver. Our method can account for uncertain agent behavior, comes with statistical guarantees on collision-free paths for one-shot missions, and scales to lifelong missions with a receding horizon sequence of one-shot instances. We run our algorithm, CP-Solver, across warehouse and game maps, with competitive throughput and reduced collisions.</description>

      <title>Towards Simulating Social Influence Dynamics with LLM-based Multi-agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models offer promising capabilities to simulate complex human social interactions. We investigate whether LLM-based multi-agent simulations can reproduce core human social dynamics observed in online forums. We evaluate conformity dynamics, group polarization, and fragmentation across different model scales and reasoning capabilities using a structured simulation framework. Our findings indicate that smaller models exhibit higher conformity rates, whereas models optimized for reasoning are more resistant to social influence.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Renal Health Decline Forecasting via Multi-LMM Collaborative Reasoning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.</description>

      <title>Bifr\"{o}st: Spatial Networking with Bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently, tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial, social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning, with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.</description>
