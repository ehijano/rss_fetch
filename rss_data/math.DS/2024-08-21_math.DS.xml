      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Green's Functions for Quasiregular Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green's functions are highly useful in analyzing the dynamical behavior of polynomials in their escaping set. The aim of this paper is to construct an analogue of Green's functions for planar quasiregular mappings of degree two and constant complex dilatation. These Green's functions are dynamically natural, in that they semi-conjugate our quasiregular mappings to the real squaring map. However, they do not share the same regularity properties as Green's functions of polynomials. We use these Green's functions to investigate properties of the boundary of the escaping set and give several examples to illustrate behavior that does not occur for the dynamics of quadratic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing and essential spectral gaps for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense $\Theta$-Anosov subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group for some nonempty subset of simple roots $\Theta$. In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space $\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows $\{a^{\mathsf{v}}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\mathsf{v}$ in the interior of the $\Theta$-limit cone $\mathcal{L}_\Theta$ of $\Gamma$, and they are H\"{o}lder conjugate to H\"{o}lder reparametrizations of the Gromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional cone $\mathscr{E} \subset \operatorname{int}\mathcal{L}_\Theta$, which is a smooth image of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to $\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a compact set of such $\mathsf{v}$. We also obtain an essential spectral gap formulated in terms of the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with a power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to prove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation flows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The exceptional cone $\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those vectors.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic tangencies in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f: M \to M$ denote a diffeomorphism of a smooth manifold $M$. Let $p$ in $M$ be its hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds $W_S$ and $W_U$, respectively. Assume that $W_S$ is a curve. Suppose that $W_U$ and $W_S$ have a degenerate homoclinic crossing at a point $B\ne p$, i.e., they cross at $B$ tangentially with a finite order of contact.
  It is shown that, subject to $C^1$-linearizability and certain conditions on the invariant manifolds, a transverse homoclinic crossing will arise arbitrarily close to $B$. This proves the existence of a horseshoe structure arbitrarily close to $B$, and extends a similar planar result of Homburg and Weiss.</description>

      <title>About identifiability and observability for a class of dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a novel approach for a class of autonomous dynamical systems that allows, given some observations of the solutions, to identify its parameters and reconstruct the state vector. This approach relies on proving the linear independence between some functions depending on the observations and its derivatives. In particular, we show that, in some cases, only low-order derivatives are necessary, opposed to classical approaches that need more derivation. We also provide different constructive procedures to retrieve the unknowns, which are based on the resolution of some linear systems. Moreover, under some analytic conditions, these unknowns may be retrieved with very few data. We finally apply this approach to some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Algebraic dependence number and cardinality of generating iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a dust-like self-similar set (generated by IFSs with the strong separation condition), Elekes, Keleti and M\'{a}th\'{e} found an invariant, called `algebraic dependence number', by considering its generating IFSs and isometry invariant self-similar measures. We find an intrinsic quantitative characterisation of this number: it is the dimension over $\mathbb{Q}$ of the vector space generated by the logarithms of all the common ratios of infinite geometric sequences in the gap length set, minus 1. With this concept, we present a lower bound on the cardinality of generating IFS (with or without separation conditions) in terms of the gap lengths of a dust-like set. We also establish analogous result for dust-like graph-directed attractors on complete metric spaces. This is a new application of the ratio analysis method and the gap sequence.</description>

      <title>Duality of Geometric Tests for Forward-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the property of forward-flatness for discrete-time systems, which is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general concept of flatness, can be checked by two different geometric tests. One is based on unique sequences of involutive distributions, while the other is based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions. In this paper, the relation between these sequences is discussed and it is shown that the tests are in fact dual. The presented results are illustrated by an academic example.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Tempo and Mode of Environmental Fluctuations on Population Growth: Slow- and Fast-Limit Approximations of Lyapunov Exponents for Periodic and Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine to what extent the tempo and mode of environmental fluctuations matter for the growth of structured populations. The models are switching, linear ordinary differential equations $x'(t)=A(\sigma(\omega t))x(t)$ where $x(t)=(x_1(t),\dots,x_d(t))$ corresponds to the population densities in the $d$ individual states, $\sigma(t)$ is a piece-wise constant function representing the fluctuations in the environmental states $1,\dots,N$, $\omega$ is the frequency of the environmental fluctuations, and $A(1),\dots,A(n)$ are Metzler matrices. $\sigma(t)$ can either be a periodic function or correspond to a continuous-time Markov chain. Under suitable conditions, there is a Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(\omega)$ such that $\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log\sum_i x_i(t)=\Lambda(\omega)$ for all non-negative, non-zero initial conditions $x(0)$ (with probability one in the random case). For both forms of switching, we derive analytical first-order and second-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ in the limits of slow ($\omega\to 0$) and fast ($\omega\to\infty$) environmental fluctuations. When the order of switching and the average switching times are equal, we show that the first-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ are equivalent in the slow-switching limit, but not in the fast-switching limit. We illustrate our results with applications to stage-structured and spatially-structured models. When dispersal rates are symmetric, the first order approximations suggest that population growth rates increase with the frequency of switching -- consistent with earlier work on periodic switching. In the absence of dispersal symmetry, we demonstrate that $\Lambda(\omega)$ can be non-monotonic in $\omega$. In conclusion, our results show how population growth rates depend on the tempo ($\omega$) and mode (random versus deterministic) of the environmental fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Predator and Prey: A Minimum Recipe for the Transition from Steady to Oscillating Precipitation in Hothouse Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present tropical atmosphere, precipitation typically exhibits noisy, small-amplitude fluctuations about an average. However, recent cloud-resolving simulations show that in a hothouse climate, precipitation can shift to a regime characterized by nonlinear oscillations. In this regime, intense precipitation events are separated by several dry days. This raises questions about what triggers the shift from a quasi-equilibrium state of precipitation to nonlinear precipitation oscillations and what factors determine the characteristics of these oscillations. To address these questions, we present a low-order model that includes two nonlinear ordinary differential equations, one for precipitation and the other for convective inhibition (CIN). Three processes govern the development of precipitation: a convective trigger that enhances precipitation, a self-limiting mechanism that reduces intense precipitation, and the effect of CIN in suppressing precipitation. On the other hand, CIN increases due to compensating subsidence from convection and decays exponentially over time due to radiation. A critical parameter in our model is the time-mean CIN (CIN*). As CIN* gradually increases, precipitation transitions from a quasi-equilibrium state to a nonlinear oscillation via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In the high CIN* limit, our model reduces to predator-prey dynamics, with CIN as the predator and precipitation as the prey. Here, the nonlinear oscillation's amplitude (maximum precipitation) grows with CIN*, and its period increases with the oscillation amplitude. A suite of cloud-resolving simulations corroborates these predictions from our low-order model, highlighting the effect of convective triggering and inhibition in regulating precipitation variability.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Banach *-algebra $\ell^1(G,A,\alpha)$, arising from a C*-dynamical system $(A,G,\alpha)$, is an hermitian Banach algebra if the discrete group $G$ is finite or abelian (or more generally, a finite extension of a nilpotent group).
  As a corollary, we obtain that $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z},C(X),\alpha)$ is hermitian, for every topological dynamical system $\Sigma = (X, \sigma)$, where $\sigma: X\to X$ is a homeomorphism of a compact Hausdorff space $X$ and the action is $\alpha_n(f)=f\circ \sigma^{-n}$ with $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Learning Deep Dissipative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

      <description>arXiv:2408.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $m \geq 2$ and a sufficiently large $q$, we apply a variant of the Maynard--Tao sieve weight to establish the existence of an arithmetic progression with common difference $q$ for which the $m$-th least prime in such progression is $\ll_m q$, which is best possible. As we vary over progressions instead of fixing a particular one, the nature of our result differs from others in the literature. Furthermore, we generalize our result to dynamical systems. The quality of the result depends crucially on the first return time, which we illustrate in the case of Diophantine approximation.</description>

Abstract: Expansivity, Li-Yorke chaos and shadowing are popular and well-studied notions of dynamical systems. Several simple and useful characterizations of these notions within the setting of linear dynamics were obtained recently. We explore these three dynamical properties for composition operators $C_{\phi}f = f \circ \phi$ induced by affine self-maps $\phi$ of the right half-plane $\mathbb{C}_{+}$ on the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{C_{+}})$.</description>

      <title>Continuation of fixed points and bifurcations from ODE to flow-kick disturbance models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some ODE models treat ecological disturbance as a continuous process, even disturbances such as fire that occur almost instantaneously on the timescale of system recovery. Alternatively, flow-kick models resolve disturbances as discrete impulses that change an ODE system's state periodically in time. Here we compare the dynamics of continuously disturbed ODE models to those of flow-kick models with the same average disturbance rate. In the case that kicks are small and high-frequency, we find multiple similarities between continuous and analogous discrete disturbance models. First, we prove that flow-kick maps generate an analogous vector field in the limit as the period between kicks approaches zero. Second, we present conditions under which equilibria, saddle-node bifurcations, and transcritical bifurcations continue from ODE to flow-kick systems. On the other hand, we also provide numerical evidence that similarities between continuous and discrete disturbance models can break down as the period between kick grows. We illustrate implications of these differences for climate change in a nonspatial Klausmeier model of vegetation and precipitation dynamics. We conclude that although ODEs may suffice to model high-frequency disturbances, resolving lower-frequency disturbances in time may be essential to effectively predicting their effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a real analytic nonexpansive map on a polyhedral normed space has a nonempty fixed point set, then we show that there is an isometry from an affine subspace onto the fixed point set. As a corollary, we prove that for any real analytic 1-norm or $\infty$-norm nonexpansive map on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive integer $q$ such that the period of any periodic orbit divides $q$ and $q$ is the order, or twice the order, of a permutation on $n$ letters. This confirms Nussbaum's $2^n$ Conjecture for $\infty$-norm nonexpansive maps in the special case where the maps are also real analytic.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the topology of Pseudo-B\"ottcher totally invariant connected components of the wandering set in dynamical systems generated by on-invertible inner (open surjective isolated) mappings of compact surfaces. We describe the possible topological types of these invariant connected subsets, which are more diverse then corresponding components of homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Strong exponential stability of switched impulsive systems with mode-constrained switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07751</link>

Abstract: Strong stability, defined by bounds that decay not only over time but also with the number of impulses, has been established as a requirement to ensure robustness properties for impulsive systems with respect to inputs or disturbances. Most existing results, however, only consider weak stability, where the bounds only decay with time. In this paper, we provide a method for calculating the maximum overshoot and the decay rate for strong global uniform exponential stability bounds for nonlinear switched impulsive systems. We consider the scenario of mode-constrained switching where not all transitions between subsystems are allowed, and where subsystems may exhibit unstable dynamics in the flow and/or jump maps. Based on direct and reverse mode-dependent average dwell-time and activation-time constraints, we derive stability bounds that can be improved by considering longer switching sequences for computation. We provide an example that shows how the results can be employed to ensure the stability robustness of nonlinear systems that admit a global state weak linearization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as ``dynamical importance'', which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>
