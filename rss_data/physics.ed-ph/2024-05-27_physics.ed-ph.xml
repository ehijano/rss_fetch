      <title>Breaking Barriers: Investigating Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Lab Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent underrepresentation of women and other gender minorities in physical science fields has been an ongoing concern. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory physics laboratory courses, specifically exploring whether students of different gender identities exhibit equal inclination and confidence in conducting lab experiments, and whether they face barriers that impact their participation. The study was conducted across three institutions, involving non-physics students enrolled in algebra-based and calculus-based physics courses. Our findings reveal no significant differences in participation levels across genders in various lab activities. However, a subtle yet significant trended was observed: non-male students tend to express greater preferences and comfort levels for note-taking, calculations, and graphing tasks compared to their male counterparts, who gravitated more towards hands-on equipment handling. Although no overt barriers deterring participation based solely on gender were identified, some students reported experiences or witnessed instances where gender dynamics hindered full engagement, such as assumptions about competence or difficulty asserting voices in male-dominated groups. These findings contribute insights into potential gender-based inclinations and experiences within laboratory environments. The results underscore the importance of fostering an inclusive climate that encourages equitable opportunities and engagement from all gender identities in scientific exploration and learning.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Study from the First Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience for Online Degree-Seeking Astronomy Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research-based active learning approaches are critical for the teaching and learning of undergraduate STEM majors. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are becoming more commonplace in traditional, in-person academic environments, but have only just started to be utilized in online education. Online education has been shown to create accessible pathways to knowledge for individuals from nontraditional student backgrounds, and increasing the diversity of STEM fields has been identified as a priority for future generations of scientists and engineers. We developed and instructed a rigorous, six-week curriculum on the topic of observational astronomy, dedicated to educating second year online astronomy students in practices and techniques for astronomical research. Throughout the course, the students learned about telescopes, the atmosphere, filter systems, adaptive optics systems, astronomical catalogs, and image viewing and processing tools. We developed a survey informed by previous research validated assessments aimed to evaluate course feedback, course impact, student self-efficacy, student science identity and community values, and student sense of belonging. The survey was administered at the conclusion of the course to all eleven students yielding eight total responses. Although preliminary, the results of our analysis indicate that student confidence in utilizing the tools and skills taught in the course was significant. Students also felt a great sense of belonging to the astronomy community and increased confidence in conducting astronomical research in the future.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Discourse Group Roles in Inquiry-based University Science Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has characterized students' group roles in introductory physics labs with a focus on what students are handling (e.g., equipment) and documented gender inequities in student division of labor. However, student discourse is rarely investigated in university science labs. We aim to bridge the gap in the literature by characterizing student discourse group roles in inquiry-based science labs. The instructional context for this study was a summer program hosted at a private research university in the eastern United States. The program was designed as a bridge program for matriculating students who were first generation and/or deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Accommodations such as interpreters and technology were provided for DHH students. We analyzed 15 students' discourse moves in five lab activities from the video recordings, resulting in a total of 40 student-lab units. We developed codes to describe student discourse moves: asking a question, proposing an idea, participating in discussion, chatting off-task, and talking to instructor. We conducted a cluster analysis using those 40 student-lab units on our quantified discourse moves to characterize students' discourse styles (i.e., clusters). We identified four discourse styles, high on-task high social, high on-task low social, low on-task low social, and low on-task high social. The results show that individual students tend to demonstrate varying discourse styles in different lab activities; students' discourse styles within the same groups tend to be aligned with their group members. Moreover, no difference was observed in discourse styles between genders, but DHH students were observed to participate significantly less in group discourse. We propose that group-level interventions that specifically target discourse should be used to promote productive and equitable small-group discourse in university science labs.</description>

      <title>Canadian Physics Counts: An exploration of the diverse identities of physics students and professionals in Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of diversity in physics remains a persistent worldwide problem. Despite being a quantitative discipline which relies on measurements to construct and validate hypotheses, there remains a paucity of data on both demographics and experiences of marginalized groups. In Canada, there has never been a nationwide assessment of those studying or working in physics. Here, we present findings from Canadian Physics Counts: the first national survey of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the Canadian physics community. Our intersectional approach allowed us to gather a wealth of information on gender identity, sexual orientation, race, disability, and more. Analyses revealed key findings, including the first data on physicists who identify as non-binary or gender diverse, as well as the first data on Black and Indigenous scholars. Black physicists (1.2%) and Indigenous physicists (.3%) were found to be the most underrepresented, while White men were overrepresented across all sectors. Among respondents with a disability, 5% reported receiving full accommodations for their required needs at their place of work or study. One in four respondents from BIPOC gender diverse backgrounds identified as being disabled, and the proportion of sexually diverse students who reported having a disability was more than three times higher than the proportion of heterosexual students with a disability. The data also revealed that students represented more demographic diversity than working professionals, highlighting the importance of acting today in order to retain the diverse physicists of tomorrow. Our analysis identifies areas for intervention and offers recommendations for building a diverse and inclusive physics community in Canada that can be a global exemplar.</description>
