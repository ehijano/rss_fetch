      <title>K-Means Panel Data Clustering in the Presence of Small Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider panel data models with group structure. We study the asymptotic behavior of least-squares estimators and information criterion for the number of groups, allowing for the presence of small groups that have an asymptotically negligible relative size. Our contributions are threefold. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the least-squares estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. One of the conditions implies that a longer sample period is required as there are smaller groups. Second, we show that information criteria for the number of groups proposed in earlier works can be inconsistent or perform poorly in the presence of small groups. Third, we propose modified information criteria (MIC) designed to perform well in the presence of small groups. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms their good performance in finite samples. An empirical application illustrates that K-means clustering paired with the proposed MIC allows one to discover small groups without producing too many groups. This enables characterizing small groups and differentiating them from the other large groups in a parsimonious group structure.</description>

      <title>Multivariate quantile regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for multivariate quantile regression based on the multivariate distribution function, termed multivariate quantile regression (MQR). In contrast to existing approaches--such as directional quantiles, vector quantile regression, or copula-based methods--MQR defines quantiles through the conditional probability structure of the joint conditional distribution function. The method constructs multivariate quantile curves using sequential univariate quantile regressions derived from conditioning mechanisms, allowing for an intuitive interpretation and flexible estimation of marginal effects. The paper develops theoretical foundations of MQR, including asymptotic properties of the estimators. Through simulation exercises, the estimator demonstrates robust finite sample performance across different dependence structures. As an empirical application, the MQR framework is applied to the analysis of exchange rate pass-through in Argentina from 2004 to 2024.</description>

      <title>Large-dimensional Factor Analysis with Weighted PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most widely used approach for large-dimensional factor analysis. While it is effective when the factors are sufficiently strong, it can be inconsistent when the factors are weak and/or the noise has complex dependence structure. We argue that the inconsistency often stems from bias and introduce a general approach to restore consistency. Specifically, we propose a general weighting scheme for PCA and show that with a suitable choice of weighting matrices, it is possible to deduce consistent and asymptotic normal estimators under much weaker conditions than the usual PCA. While the optimal weight matrix may require knowledge about the factors and covariance of the idiosyncratic noise that are not known a priori, we develop an agnostic approach to adaptively choose from a large class of weighting matrices that can be viewed as PCA for weighted linear combinations of auto-covariances among the observations. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the merits of our methodology over the usual PCA and other recently developed techniques for large-dimensional approximate factor models.</description>

      <title>Effect Identification and Unit Categorization in the Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Design with Application to LED Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results. However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of the MRD framework in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Assignment at the Frontier: Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome equals a frontier function of inputs minus a nonnegative unobserved deviation. We allow the deviation's distribution to depend on inputs, thereby allowing for endogeneity. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs -- an assumption we term assignment at the frontier -- then the frontier is identified by the supremum of the outcome at those inputs, obviating the need for instrumental variables. We then estimate the frontier, allowing for random error whose distribution may also depend on inputs. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the mean deviation, using only variance and skewness, that is robust to a scarcity of data near the frontier. We apply our methods to estimate a firm-level frontier production function and inefficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-period static hedging of European options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hedging of European options when the price of the underlying asset follows a single-factor Markovian framework. By working in such a setting, Carr and Wu \cite{carr2014static} derived a spanning relation between a given option and a continuum of shorter-term options written on the same asset. In this paper, we have extended their approach to simultaneously include options over multiple short maturities. We then show a practical implementation of this with a finite set of shorter-term options to determine the hedging error using a Gaussian Quadrature method. We perform a wide range of experiments for both the \textit{Black-Scholes} and \textit{Merton Jump Diffusion} models, illustrating the comparative performance of the two methods.</description>
