      <title>Flex-GAD : Flexible Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency, along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of signed networks in contemporary social media platforms necessitates robust privacy-preserving mechanisms. Graph unlearning, which aims to eliminate the influence of specific data points from trained models without full retraining, becomes particularly critical in these scenarios where user interactions are sensitive and dynamic. Existing graph unlearning methodologies are exclusively designed for unsigned networks and fail to account for the unique structural properties of signed graphs. Their naive application to signed networks neglects edge sign information, leading to structural imbalance across subgraphs and consequently degrading both model performance and unlearning efficiency. This paper proposes SGU (Signed Graph Unlearning), a graph unlearning framework specifically for signed networks. SGU incorporates a new graph unlearning partition paradigm and a novel signed network partition algorithm that preserve edge sign information during partitioning and ensure structural balance across partitions. Compared with baselines, SGU achieves state-of-the-art results in both model performance and unlearning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Simulating and Experimenting with Social Media Mobilization Using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano}) reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at https://github.com/CausalMP/LLM-SocioPol}</description>

      <title>Linking Heterogeneous Data with Coordinated Agent Flows for Social Media Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data, capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Link Predictions Among Peers in Online Classrooms Using Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social interactions among classroom peers, represented as social learning networks (SLNs), play a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes. While SLN analysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on centralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud server with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational settings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data prevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across multiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these challenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated Learning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm, with SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online forums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students. By leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across multiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need for raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique student interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization techniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both shared and classroom-specific representations of student interactions in SLNs. Additionally, we utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions, identifying key factors that influence link formation across different classrooms. These insights unveil the drivers of social learning interactions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML framework -- an aspect that has not been explored before.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Precinct and District Voting Data Using Persistent Homology to Identify Gerrymandering in North Carolina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gerrymandering is one of the biggest threats to American democracy. By manipulating district lines, politicians effectively choose their voters rather than the other way around. Current gerrymandering identification methods (namely the Polsby-Popper and Reock scores) focus on the compactness of congressional districts, making them extremely sensitive to physical geography. To address this gap, we extend Feng and Porter's 2021 paper, which used the level-set method to turn geographic shapefiles into filtered simplicial complexes, in order to compare precinct level voting data to district level voting data. As precincts are regarded as too small to be gerrymandered, we are able to identify discrepancies between precinct and district level voting data to quantify gerrymandering in the United States. By comparing the persistent homologies of Democratic voting regions at the precinct and district levels, we detect when areas have been "cracked" (split across multiple districts) or "packed" (compressed into one district) for partisan gain. This analysis was conducted for North Carolina House of Representatives elections (2012-2024). North Carolina has been redistricted four times in the past ten years, unusually frequent as most states redistrict decennially, making it a valuable case study. By comparing persistence barcodes at the precinct and district levels (using the bottleneck distance), we show that precinct level voting patterns do not significantly fluctuate biannually, while district level patterns do, suggesting that shifts are likely a result of redistricting rather than voter behavior, providing strong evidence of gerrymandering. This research presents a novel application of topological data analysis in evaluating gerrymandering and shows persistent homology can be useful in discerning gerrymandered districts.</description>

      <title>No Such Thing as Free Brain Time: For a Pigouvian Tax on Attention Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our age of digital platforms, human attention has become a scarce and highly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to market dynamics. This article explores the commodification of attention within the framework of the attention economy, arguing that attention should be understood as a common good threatened by over-exploitation. Drawing from philosophical, economic, and legal perspectives, we first conceptualize attention not only as an individual cognitive process but as a collective and infrastructural phenomenon susceptible to enclosure by digital intermediaries. We then identify and analyze negative externalities of the attention economy, particularly those stemming from excessive screen time: diminished individual agency, adverse health outcomes, and societal and political harms, including democratic erosion and inequality. These harms are largely unpriced by market actors and constitute a significant market failure. In response, among a spectrum of public policy tools ranging from informational campaigns to outright restrictions, we propose a Pigouvian tax on attention capture as a promising regulatory instrument to internalize the externalities and, in particular, the social cost of compulsive digital engagement. Such a tax would incentivize structural changes in platform design while preserving user autonomy. By reclaiming attention as a shared resource vital to human agency, health, and democracy, this article contributes a novel economic and policy lens to the debate on digital regulation. Ultimately, this article advocates for a paradigm shift: from treating attention as a private, monetizable asset to protecting it as a collective resource vital for humanity.</description>

      <title>Detecting Early and Implicit Suicidal Ideation via Longitudinal and Information Environment Signals on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of realistic scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>
