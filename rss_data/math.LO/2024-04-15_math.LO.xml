      <title>Weakly o-minimal types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study weak o-minimality in the context of complete types in an arbitrary first-order theory. A type $p\in S(A)$ is weakly o-minimal with respect to $&lt;$, a relatively $A$-definable linear order on $p(\mathfrak C)$, if every relatively definable subset has finitely many convex components; we prove that in that case the latter holds for all orders. Notably, we prove: (i) a monotonicity theorem for relatively definable functions on the locus of a weakly o-minimal type; (ii) weakly o-minimal types are dp-minimal, and the weak and forking non-orthogonality are equivalence relations on weakly o-minimal types. For a weakly o-minimal pair $\mathbf p=(p,&lt;)$, we introduce the notions of the left- and right-$\mathbf p$-genericity of $a\models p$ over $B$; the latter is denoted by $B\triangleleft^{\mathbf p}a$. We prove that $\triangleleft^{\mathbf p}$ behaves particularly well on realizations of $p$: the $\triangleleft^{\mathbf p}$-incomparability and forking-dependence of $x$ and $y$ over the domain of $p$ are the same equivalence relation and the quotient order is dense linear. We show that this naturally generalizes to the set of realizations of weakly o-minimal types from a fixed $\not\perp^w$-class.</description>

      <title>Quantifier alternation depth in universal Boolean doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a quantifier-stratified universal Boolean doctrine. This notion requires additional structure on a universal Boolean doctrine, accounting for the quantifier alternation depth of formulas. After proving that every Boolean doctrine over a small base category admits a quantifier completion, we show how to freely add the first layer of quantifier alternation depth to these doctrines. To achieve this, we characterize, within the doctrinal setting, the classes of quantifier-free formulas whose universal closure is valid in some common model.</description>

      <title>Classification of Boolean Algebras through von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}-$Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a "von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring", which is a model for a specific equational theory. We delve into the characteristics of these rings and demonstrate that each Boolean space can be effectively represented as the image of a von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring through a specific functor. Additionally, we establish that every homomorphism between Boolean algebras can be expressed through a $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring homomorphism between von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-rings.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic logic over semi-primal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>A General Probabilistic Framework in IMALL: A Concrete Categorical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear lambda-calculus extended with the sup type constructor, which provides an additive conjunction along with a non-deterministic destructor. The sup type constructor has been introduced in the context of quantum computing. In this paper, we study this type constructor within a simple linear logic categorical model, employing the category of semimodules over a commutative semiring. We demonstrate that the non-deterministic destructor, either weighted or not, finds a suitable model in a weighted codiagonal map. Our approach offers a valid and insightful alternative to interpreting non-determinism and probability calculi, in instances where the conventional Moggi's Powerset Monad interpretation does not align with the category's structure, as is the case with the category of semimodules. The validity of this alternative relies on the presence of biproducts within the category.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>
