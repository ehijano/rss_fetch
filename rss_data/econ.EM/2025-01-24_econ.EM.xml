      <title>An Adaptive Moving Average for Macroeconomic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of moving averages is pervasive in macroeconomic monitoring, particularly for tracking noisy series such as inflation. The choice of the look-back window is crucial. Too long of a moving average is not timely enough when faced with rapidly evolving economic conditions. Too narrow averages are noisy, limiting signal extraction capabilities. As is well known, this is a bias-variance trade-off. However, it is a time-varying one: the optimal size of the look-back window depends on current macroeconomic conditions. In this paper, we introduce a simple adaptive moving average estimator based on a Random Forest using as sole predictor a time trend. Then, we compare the narratives inferred from the new estimator to those derived from common alternatives across series such as headline inflation, core inflation, and real activity indicators. Notably, we find that this simple tool provides a different account of the post-pandemic inflation acceleration and subsequent deceleration.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the Distribution Function of the argmax of a Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasingly important class of estimators has members whose asymptotic distribution is non-Gaussian, yet characterizable as the argmax of a Gaussian process. This paper presents high-level sufficient conditions under which such asymptotic distributions admit a continuous distribution function. The plausibility of the sufficient conditions is demonstrated by verifying them in three prominent examples, namely maximum score estimation, empirical risk minimization, and threshold regression estimation. In turn, the continuity result buttresses several recently proposed inference procedures whose validity seems to require a result of the kind established herein. A notable feature of the high-level assumptions is that one of them is designed to enable us to employ the celebrated Cameron-Martin theorem. In a leading special case, the assumption in question is demonstrably weak and appears to be close to minimal.</description>

      <title>Generalizability with ignorance in mind: learning what we do (not) know for archetypes discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying policy interventions, researchers are often interested in two related goals: i) learning for which types of individuals the program has the largest effects (heterogeneity) and ii) understanding whether those patterns of treatment effects have predictive power across environments (generalizability). To that end, we develop a framework to learn from the data how to partition observations into groups of individual and environmental characteristics whose effects are generalizable for others - a set of generalizable archetypes. Our view is that implicit in the task of archetypal discovery is detecting those contexts where effects do not generalize and where researchers should collect more evidence before drawing inference on treatment effects. We introduce a method that jointly estimates when and how a prediction can be formed and when, instead, researchers should admit ignorance and elicit further evidence before making predictions. We provide both a decision-theoretic and Bayesian foundation of our procedure. We derive finite-sample (frequentist) regret guarantees, asymptotic theory for inference, and discuss computational properties. We illustrate the benefits of our procedure over existing alternatives that would fail to admit ignorance and force pooling across all units by re-analyzing a multifaceted program targeted towards the poor across six different countries.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a network-based method to capture unobserved heterogeneity in consumer microdata. We develop a permutation-based approach that repeatedly samples subsets of choices from each agent and partitions agents into jointly rational types. Aggregating these partitions yields a network that characterizes the unobserved heterogeneity, as edges denote the fraction of times two agents belong to the same type across samples. To evaluate how observable characteristics align with the heterogeneity, we implement permutation tests that shuffle covariate labels across network nodes, thereby generating a null distribution of alignment. We further introduce various network-based measures of alignment that assess whether nodes sharing the same observable values are disproportionately linked or clustered, and introduce standardized effect sizes that measure how strongly each covariate "tilts" the entire network away from random assignment. These non-parametric effect sizes capture the global influence of observables on the heterogeneity structure. We apply the method to grocery expenditure data from the Stanford Basket Dataset.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with an emphasis on the vectors that define canonical variables. The paper shows that when two dimensions of data grow to infinity jointly and proportionally, the classical CCA procedure for estimating those vectors fails to deliver a consistent estimate. This provides the first result on the impossibility of identification of canonical variables in the CCA procedure when all dimensions are large. As a countermeasure, the paper derives the magnitude of the estimation error, which can be used in practice to assess the precision of CCA estimates. Applications of the results to cyclical vs. non-cyclical stocks and to a limestone grassland data set are provided.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Triple Gamma Prior as a Shrinkage Process Prior for Time-Varying Parameter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many existing shrinkage approaches for time-varying parameter (TVP) models assume constant innovation variances across time points, inducing sparsity by shrinking these variances toward zero. However, this assumption falls short when states exhibit large jumps or structural changes, as often seen in empirical time series analysis. To address this, we propose the dynamic triple gamma prior -- a stochastic process that induces time-dependent shrinkage by modeling dependence among innovations while retaining a well-known triple gamma marginal distribution. This framework encompasses various special and limiting cases, including the horseshoe shrinkage prior, making it highly flexible. We derive key properties of the dynamic triple gamma that highlight its dynamic shrinkage behavior and develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed approach is evaluated through sparse covariance modeling and forecasting of the returns of the EURO STOXX 50 index, demonstrating favorable forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>Valid Inference on Functions of Causal Effects in the Absence of Microdata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in functions of multiple causal effects, a leading example of which is evaluating a policy's cost-effectiveness. The benefits and costs might be captured by multiple causal effects and aggregated into a scalar measure of cost-effectiveness. Oftentimes, the microdata underlying these estimates is inaccessible; only published estimates and their corresponding standard errors are available. We provide a method to conduct inference on non-linear functions of causal effects when the only information available is the point estimates and their standard errors. We apply our method to inference for the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF) of government policies.</description>
