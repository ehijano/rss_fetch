      <title>Low-cost mobile 3D scanning of heritage objects to facilitate long-distance research collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While three-dimensional visualization has become a common tool in various cultural heritage applications, the emphasis has been on high fidelity representation, essentially the generation of digital twins or digital reconstructions. Overlooked appears to be the utility of 3D in research collaboration where one of the researchers has access to the original, potentially fragile object while the others are based in remote locations. This paper describes the application of a low-cost, mobile and swiftly executable 3D scanning process and discusses the benefits of this for remote collaboration of three-dimensional objects of material culture</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15012v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools has revolutionized various facets of our lives, particularly in the realm of social media. For students, these advancements have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for learning, collaboration, and personal growth. AI-driven applications are transforming how students interact with social media, offering personalized content and recommendations, and enabling smarter, more efficient communication. Recent studies utilizing data from UniversityCube underscore the profound impact of AI tools on students' academic and social experiences. These studies reveal that students engaging with AI-enhanced social media platforms report higher academic performance, enhanced critical thinking skills, and increased engagement in collaborative projects.
  Moreover, AI tools assist in filtering out distracting content, allowing students to concentrate more on educational materials and pertinent discussions. The integration of LLMs in social media has further facilitated improved peer-to-peer communication and mentorship opportunities. AI algorithms effectively match students based on shared academic interests and career goals, fostering a supportive and intellectually stimulating online community, thereby contributing to increased student satisfaction and retention rates.
  In this article, we delve into the data provided by UniversityCube to explore how LLMs and AI tools are specifically transforming social media for students. Through case studies and statistical analyses, we offer a comprehensive understanding of the educational and social benefits these technologies offer. Our exploration highlights the potential of AI-driven tools to create a more enriched, efficient, and supportive educational environment for students in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Graph Homophily Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes. There are several measures used for assessing homophily but all are known to have certain drawbacks: in particular, they cannot be reliably used for comparing datasets with varying numbers of classes and class size balance. To show this, previous works on graph homophily suggested several properties desirable for a good homophily measure, also noting that no existing homophily measure has all these properties. Our paper addresses this issue by introducing a new homophily measure - unbiased homophily - that has all the desirable properties and thus can be reliably used across datasets with different label distributions. The proposed measure is suitable for undirected (and possibly weighted) graphs. We show both theoretically and via empirical examples that the existing homophily measures have serious drawbacks while unbiased homophily has a desirable behavior for the considered scenarios. Finally, when it comes to directed graphs, we prove that some desirable properties contradict each other and thus a measure satisfying all of them cannot exist.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Community Detection via Quasi-Stationary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is a widely used method for community detection in networks. We focus on a semi-supervised community detection scenario in the Partially Labeled Stochastic Block Model (PL-SBM) with two balanced communities, where a fixed portion of labels is known. Our approach leverages random walks in which the revealed nodes in each community act as absorbing states. By analyzing the quasi-stationary distributions associated with these random walks, we construct a classifier that distinguishes the two communities by examining differences in the associated eigenvectors. We establish upper and lower bounds on the error rate for a broad class of quasi-stationary algorithms, encompassing both spectral and voting-based approaches. In particular, we prove that this class of algorithms can achieve the optimal error rate in the connected regime. We further demonstrate empirically that our quasi-stationary approach improves performance on both real-world and simulated datasets.</description>

      <title>Universal Inceptive GNNs by Eliminating the Smoothness-generalization Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, such as transaction and social net-works. However, their application is often hindered by the varyinghomophily levels across different orders of neighboring nodes, ne-cessitating separate model designs for homophilic and heterophilicgraphs. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified framework ca-pable of handling neighborhoods of various orders and homophilylevels. Through theoretical exploration, we identify a previouslyoverlooked architectural aspect in multi-hop learning: the cascadedependency, which leads to asmoothness-generalization dilemma.This dilemma significantly affects the learning process, especiallyin the context of high-order neighborhoods and heterophilic graphs.To resolve this issue, we propose an Inceptive Graph Neural Net-work (IGNN), a universal message-passing framework that replacesthe cascade dependency with an inceptive architecture. IGNN pro-vides independent representations for each hop, allowing personal-ized generalization capabilities, and captures neighborhood-wiserelationships to select appropriate receptive fields. Extensive ex-periments show that our IGNN outperforms 23 baseline methods,demonstrating superior performance on both homophilic and het-erophilic graphs, while also scaling efficiently to large graphs.</description>

This review and vision paper explores the evolving role of applied statistics in the AI era, drawing from our experiences in engineering statistics. We begin by outlining the fundamental concepts and historical developments in applied statistics and tracing the rise of AI technologies. Subsequently, we review traditional areas of applied statistics, using examples from engineering statistics to illustrate key points. We then explore emerging areas in applied statistics, driven by recent technological advancements, highlighting examples from our recent projects. The paper discusses the symbiotic relationship between AI and applied statistics, focusing on how statistical principles can be employed to study the properties of AI models and enhance AI systems. We also examine how AI can advance applied statistics in terms of modeling and analysis. In conclusion, we reflect on the future role of statisticians. Our paper aims to shed light on the transformative impact of AI on applied statistics and inspire further exploration in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamic Under Malicious Agent Influence in Multi-Agent Systems: From the Perspective of Opinion Evolution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent systems(MASs). First, this paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious agents on the opinion evolution process, reveals the additional evolution cost it brings, and provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent solutions. Secondly, based on the characteristics of opinion evolution, the malicious agent isolation algorithm based on opinion evolution direction vector is proposed, which does not strongly restrict the proportion of malicious agents. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively eliminate the negative influence of malicious agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</description>
