      <title>Producing entangled photon pairs and quantum squeezed states in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma is capable of mediating the conversion of two pump photons into two different photons through a relativistic four-wave mixing nonlinearity. Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.</description>

      <title>Coriolis Forces Modify Magnetostatic Ponderomotive Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible to produce a ponderomotive effect in a plasma system without time-varying fields, if the plasma flows over spatially oscillations in the field. This can be achieved by superimposing a spatially oscillatory perturbation on a guide field, then setting up an electric field perpendicular to the guide field to drive flow over the perturbation. However, subtle distinctions in the structure of the resulting electric field can entirely change the behavior of the resulting ponderomotive force. Previous work has shown that, in slab models, these distinctions can be explained in terms of the polarization of the effective wave that appears in the co-moving frame. Here we consider what happens to this picture in a cylindrical system, where the transformation to the co-moving (rotating) frame is not inertial. It turns out that the non-inertial nature of this frame transformation can lead to counterintuitive behavior, partly due to the appearance of parallel (magnetic-field-aligned) electric fields in the rotating frame even in cases where none existed in the laboratory frame. Apart from the academic interest of this study, the practical impact lies in being better able to anticipate the antenna configuration on the plasma periphery of a cylindrical plasma that will lead to optimal ponderomotive barrier formation in the interior plasma.</description>

      <title>Electron Self-Polarization in a Quantum-Radiation-Dominated Beam-Plasma Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a feasible method for producing an ultrarelativistic kiloampere spin-polarized electron beam through a multi-GeV unpolarized dense electron beam grazing a solid target composed of two foil layers. In this scheme, a strong asymmetric plasma field is generated by plasma electron backflows between the two foils, leading to a significant radiation via the nonlinear Compton scatter. We show that by positioning the target at an appropriate tilt angle, the electrons emitting high-energy photons can gain high polarization and be reflected above the target. Moreover, the double-layer target setup not only strengthens the asymmetric plasma field but also induces a plasma bubble that further focuses the reflected electrons and reshape their polarization distribution. Our particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate the generation of a dense polarized electron beam with an average polarization exceeding 30% and a conversion rate greater than 10%. Through further selection of energy and angle, a picocoulomb electron beam with a current of approximately 0.4 kA and a polarization degree of 65% can be obtained at a energy peak of 1.5 GeV within 35$\times$35 mrad$^2$ angular spread and 10% energy spread. Such polarized electron beams have potential applications in high-energy physics and laboratory astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Convergent trajectories of relativistic electrons interacting with lasers in plasma waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic electrons interacting with a laser pulse in a plasma wave has been investigated theoretically and numerically based on the classical Landau-Lifshitz equation. There exists a convergent trajectory of electrons when the energy gain of electrons via direct laser acceleration can compensate the energy loss via radiation. An electron beam initially around the convergent trajectory evolves into the trajectory, making its occupied phase space volume decrease exponentially while mean energy remain the same. This mechanism can be used for cooling relativistic electron beams especially those produced in plasma-based acceleration.</description>

      <title>Plasma Rotation Induced by Biasing in Axially Symmetric Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics of the plasma rotation driven by biasing in linear traps is analyzed for two limiting cases. The first, relevant for traps with decent plasma parameters, considers the line-tying effects to be responsible for the drive as well as for the dissipation of the angular momentum. Meanwhile, in long and thin traps with low plasma parameters or developed turbulence the radial transport of the angular momentum becomes its primary loss channel. The momentum flux goes into the scrape-off layer; that makes conditions there partially responsible for the achievable rotation limits.</description>

      <title>Reality of Inverse Cascading in Neutron Star Crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain - with its extreme aspect ratio - requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this extreme aspect ratio limits the inverse cascade to magnetic field structures on scales comparable to the neutron star's crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite this limitation, the inverse cascade can significantly impact the magnetic field evolution in the interior of the crust, potentially explaining the observed characteristics of highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars or central compact objects.</description>

      <title>Periodic Korteweg-de Vries soliton potentials generate magnetic field strength with excellent quasisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, $B$, that confines charged particles effectively in a three-dimensional toroidal plasma equilibrium. Here, we show that QS has a deep connection to the underlying symmetry that makes solitons possible. We uncover a hidden lower dimensionality of $B$ on a magnetic flux surface, which could make stellarator optimization schemes significantly more efficient. Recent breakthroughs (M. Landreman and E. Paul, PRL 2022) have yielded configurations with excellent volumetric QS and surprisingly low magnetic shear. Our approach elucidates why the magnetic shear is low in these configurations. Given $B$, we deduce an upper bound on the maximum toroidal volume that can be quasisymmetric only from the properties of $B$ and verify it for the Landreman-Paul precise quasiaxisymmetric (QA) stellarator configuration. In the neighborhood of the outermost surface, we show that $B$ approaches the form of the 1-soliton reflectionless potential. The connection length diverges, indicating the possible presence of an X-point that could potentially be used as basis for a divertor. We present three independent approaches to demonstrate that quasisymmetric $B$ is described by well-known integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and Gardner's equation. The first approach is weakly nonlinear multiscale perturbation theory. We show that the overdetermined problem of finding quasisymmetric vacuum fields admits solutions for which the rotational transform and the magnetic shear are highly constrained. Our second approach is non-perturbative and based on ensuring single-valuedness of $B$, which directly leads to its Painlev\'e property shared by the KdV equation. Our third machine-learning-based approach robustly recovers the KdV (and Gardner's equation) from a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators.</description>

      <title>Impurity Parallel Velocity Gradient instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetized plasmas, a radial gradient of parallel velocity, where parallel refers to the direction of magnetic field, can destabilise an electrostatic mode called as Parallel Velocity Gradient (PVG). The theory of PVG has been mainly developed assuming a single species of ions. Here, the role of impurities is investigated based on a linear, local analysis, in a homogeneous, constant magnetic field. To further simplify the analysis, the plasma is assumed to contain only two ion species - main ions and one impurity species - while our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to more species. In the cold-ion limit, retaining polarization drift for both main ions and impurity ions, and assuming Boltzmann electrons, the system is described by 4 fluid equations closed by quasi-neutrality. The linearized equations can be reduced to 2 coupled equations: one for the electric potential, and one for the effective parallel velocity fluctuations, which is a linear combination of main ion and impurity parallel velocity fluctuations. This reduced system can be understood as a generalisation of the Hasegawa-Mima model. With finite radial gradient of impurity parallel flow, the linear dispersion relation then describes a new instability: the impurity-modified PVG (i-PVG). Instability condition is described in terms of either the main ion flow shear, or equivalently, an effective flow shear, which combines main ion and impurity flow shears. Impurities can have a stabilising or destabilising role, depending on the parameters, and in particular the direction of main flow shear against impurity flow shear. Assuming a reasonable value of perpendicular wavenumber, the maximum growth rate is estimated, depending on impurity mass, charge, and concentration.</description>

      <title>Comment on "ENN's roadmap for proton-boron fusion based on spherical torus" [Phys. Plasmas 31, 062507 (2024)]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This comment discusses the feasibility of hot ion mode ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ for proton-boron fusion which is critical for the roadmap proposed in Liu, M et al [Phys. Plasmas 31, 062507 (2024)]. The hot ion mode ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ has been calculated to be far from accessible (${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}&lt;1.5$ for ${{T}_{i}}=150\text{keV}$) under the most optimal conditions if fusion provides the heating (Xie, H [Introduction to Fusion Ignition Principles: Zeroth Order Factors of Fusion Energy Research (in Chinese), USTC Press, Hefei, 2023]), i.e., that all fusion power serves to heat the ions and that electrons acquire energy only through interactions with ions. We also discuss if hot ion mode of ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ could be achieved by an ideal heating method which is much more efficient than fusion itself (near 20 times fusion power for ${{T}_{i}}=150\text{keV}$) and only heats the ions, whether it makes sense economically.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Proton and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of non-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a vertical structure terahertz field emission transistor that utilizes a high-angle oblique deposition method to form a self-packaged vacuum microcavity. The simulation demonstrates that the self-packaged microcavity can effectively mitigate the potential impact of conventional field emission transistors on surrounding solid-state circuits, thereby improving the frequency performance and stability of the device. The proposed design exhibits a cutoff frequency at the sub-terahertz level.</description>

      <title>Global Stellarator Coil Optimization with Quadratic Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly $10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament coil complexity with three numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Betatron oscillation of trapped electrons in laser-driven long-distance propagating plasma bubble has been investigated with the help of particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical analysis. Parametric oscillation of the trapped electron beam is identified as a result of bubble breathing which develops with the steepening and depletion of the laser pulse. It leads to parametric amplification of the betatron oscillation of the electron beam with the exponential growth of its amplitude. It results in severe degradation of the qualities of the electron beam and thus is important for long-scale laser wakefield acceleration.</description>
