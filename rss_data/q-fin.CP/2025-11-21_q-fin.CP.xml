      <title>Machine Learning vs. Randomness: Challenges in Predicting Binary Options Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary options trading is often marketed as a field where predictive models can generate consistent profits. However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.</description>

      <title>Generative AI, Managerial Expectations, and Economic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from 120,000+ corporate conference call transcripts. The resulting AI Economy Score predicts GDP growth, production, and employment up to 10 quarters ahead, beyond existing measures like survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. A composite measure that integrates managerial expectations about firm, industry, and macroeconomic conditions further significantly improves the forecasting power and predictive horizon of national and sectoral growth. Our findings show managerial expectations offer unique insights into economic activity, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>

      <title>TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, volatility, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. Here, we address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. We propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows as time series conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, to market data by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting a 3.27 and 3.48 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. To perform the experiments, we developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for LOB market simulation with deep learning. In our repository, we include a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generated simulations.</description>
