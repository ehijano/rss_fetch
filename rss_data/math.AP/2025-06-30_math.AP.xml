      <title>Remarks on the fine structure of the free boundary (the no-sign obstacle problem)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a number of results inspired by the approach developed in a recent work by A. Figalli and J. Serra on the fine structure of the obstacle problem, which turns out to be partially effective in addressing the no-sign obstacle problem. However, we also highlight one or two central questions that remain open and appear to require different techniques not presently available to us.</description>

      <title>Planar pulsating traveling wave solutions of non-cooperative Fisher--KPP systems in space-time periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-cooperative Fisher-KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients are motivated for instance by models for structured populations evolving in periodic environments. This paper is concerned with entire solutions describing the invasion of open space by a persistent population at constant speed. These solutions are important in the understanding of long-time behaviors for the Cauchy problem. Adapting methods developed for scalar equations satisfying the comparison principle as well as methods developed for systems with homogeneous coefficients, we prove, in each spatial direction, the existence of a critical speed such that: there exists no almost planar generalized transition waves with a smaller speed; if the direction is rational, each rational speed not smaller than the critical speed is the speed of a weak planar pulsating traveling wave; if the coefficients are homogeneous in space, each speed not smaller than the critical speed is the speed of a strong planar pulsating traveling wave.</description>

      <title>A note on Sobolev-Lorentz Capacity and Hausdorff measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an elementary proof that sets of zero $p,1$-Sobolev-Lorentz capacity $\mathcal{H}^{n-p}$-null sets independently of non-linear potential theory. We further show that there exists a set of Sobolev-Lorentz-$(p,1)$ capacity equal zero with Hausdorff dimension equal $n-p$.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow that is none: Heat flow with Wentzell boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a representation of the heat flow with Wentzell boundary conditions on smooth domains as gradient descent dynamics for the entropy in a suitably extended Otto manifold of probability measures with additional boundary parts. Yet it is shown that for weak boundary diffusion, the associated Fokker-Planck dynamics cannot be recovered from any entropy-driven metric JKO-Wasserstein scheme, at least if the underlying point metric satisfies certain natural regularity assumptions. This discrepancy is illustrated in competing large-deviation heuristics in the Sanov and Schilder regimes.</description>

      <title>Weak comparison principle for widely degenerate elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a comparison principle for local weak solutions to a class of widely degenerate elliptic equations of the form \begin{equation}
  -\text{div} \left( \left(|Du|-1 \right)^{p-1}_+\frac{Du}{|Du|} \right) = f(x,u) \qquad \text{ in } \Omega,\notag
  \end{equation}
  where $p \ge 2$ and $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\geq2$.
  Moreover, we establish some second order regularity results of the solutions, that yields a weighted Sobolev inequality with widely degenerate weights.</description>

      <title>Multiple sign-changing and semi-nodal normalized solutions for a Gross-Pitaevskii type system on bounded domain: the $L^2$-supercritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of multiple sign-changing and semi-nodal normalized solutions for an $m$-coupled elliptic system of the Gross-Pitaevskii type:
  \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta u_j + \lambda_j u_j = \sum_{k=1 }^m\beta_{kj} u_k^2 u_j, \quad u_j \in H_0^1(\Omega),
  &amp;\int_\Omega u_j^2dx = c_j, \quad j = 1,2,\cdots,m.
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation}
  Here, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N = 3,4$) is a bounded domain. The constants $\beta_{kj} \neq 0$ and $c_j &gt; 0$ are prescribed constants, while $\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m$ are unknown and appear as Lagrange multipliers. This is the first result in the literature on the existence and multiplicity of sign-changing and semi-nodal normalized solutions of couple Schr\"odinger system in all regimes of $\beta_{kj}$. The main tool which we use is a new skill of vector linking and this article attempts for the first time to use linking method to search for solutions of a coupled system. Particularly, to obtain semi-nodal normalized solutions, we introduce partial vector linking which is new up to our knowledge. Moreover, by investigating the limit process as $\vec{c}=(c_1,\ldots,c_m) \to \vec{0}$ we obtain some bifurcation results. Note that when $N=4$, the system is of Sobolev critical.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to incompressible heat-conducting motions with large flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem for viscous incompressible heat-conduc\-ting fluid in a finite cylinder with large inflow and outflow, modelled with Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the heat equation. We prove energy estimate without restrictions on the magnitudes of the external force, initial data, inflow and outflow. In order to estimate nonlinear terms we use weighted spaces. Next, using Galerkin approximation, we show existence of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and decay for a Grushin problem in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with singular, convective, critical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an existence result for a problem set in the whole Euclidean space involving the Grushin operator and featuring a critical term perturbed by a singular, convective reaction. Our approach combines variational methods, truncation techniques, and concentration-compactness arguments, together with set-valued analysis and fixed point theory. Additionally, we prove the decay at infinity of solutions in the absence of the convective term. The result is new even in the case where more than one feature between singularity, convectivity and criticality is taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second eigenfunction of the Neumann Laplacian on convex, planar domains is considered. Inspired by the famous hot spots conjecture and a related result of Steinerberger, we show that potential critical points of this eigenfunction (and, in particular, interior "hot spots") cannot be located "near the center" of the domain. The region in which critical points are excluded is described explicitly.</description>

      <title>Boundary Estimates for the Monge-Amp\`ere Equation in the Polygons with Guillemin Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Schauder-type boundary regularity result for a two-dimensional singular Monge-Amp\'ere equation on convex polytopes with Guillemin boundary conditions. This extends the previous work of Rubin and Huang to the case where the right-hand side is less regular; specifically, H\"older continuous functions. Our method relies heavily on the sophisticated techniques developed by Donaldson in his series of papers on the Abreu equation.</description>

      <title>Density estimates for a (non)local variational model with degenerate double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide density estimates for a class of functions which includes all the minimizers of the energy
  $\mathcal{E}_s^p(u,\Omega):=(1-s)\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}\,dx\,dy +\int_{\Omega}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}\,dx\,dy\right)+\int_{\Omega}W(u(x))\,dx,$
  where $p\in (1,+\infty)$, $s \in \left(0,1\right)$ and $W$ is a double-well potential with polynomial growth $m\in \left[p,+\infty\right)$ from the minima. The nonlocal estimates obtained are uniform as $s\to1$.
  Moreover, making use of a $\Gamma$-convergence result for $\mathcal{E}_s^p$ as $s\to 1$, we obtain density estimates for the minimizers of the limit energy functional, which takes the form
  $\mathcal{E}_1^p(u,\Omega):=\frac{K_{n,p}}{2p}\int_{\Omega} \left|\nabla u(x)\right|^p+\int_{\Omega} W(u(x))\,dx,$
  for a suitable $K_{n,p}\in (0,+\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness results of unsteady reactive flows in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miscible reactive flows in porous media play crucial roles in many engineering and industrial applications. In this work, we establish several results regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a system of time-dependent, nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the flow and transport of miscible reactive fluids with variable viscosity in heterogeneous porous media with variable permeability. Fluid flow is modelled via the unsteady Darcy-Brinkman equation with Korteweg stresses coupled with an advection-diffusion-reacton equation for the transport of a solute responsible for the viscosity variation and the Korteweg stresses. Our analysis is based on the semi-discrete Galerkin method, which allows us to pass the limit and establish that the approximate solution converges to the solution of the proposed problem. We also discuss particular cases that are widely used in the studies of miscible fingering instabilities in the porous media with application in oil recovery and/or geological carbon sequestration.</description>

      <title>Relaxation enhancement by controlling incompressible fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a PDE-controllability based approach to the enhancement of diffusive mixing for passive scalar fields. Unlike in the existing literature, our relaxation enhancing fields are not prescribed $\textit{ab initio}$ at every time and at every point of the spatial domain. Instead, we prove that time-dependent relaxation enhancing vector fields can be obtained as $\textit{state trajectories of control systems described by the incompressible Euler equations}$ either driven by finite-dimensional controls or by controls localized in space. The main ingredient of our proof is a new approximate controllability theorem for the incompressible Euler equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$, ensuring the approximate tracking of the full state all over the considered time interval. Combining this with a continuous dependence result yields enhanced relaxation for the passive scalar field. Another essential tool in our analysis is the exact controllability of the incompressible Euler system driven by spatially localized forces.</description>

      <title>Global regularity and incompressible limit of 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global regularity of large solutions with vacuum to the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^{2}=\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, when the volume (bulk) viscosity coefficient $\nu$ is sufficiently large. It firstly fixes a flaw in [10, Proposition 3.3], which concerns the $\nu$-independent global $t$-weighted estimates of the solutions. Amending the proof requires non-trivially mathematical analysis. As a by-product, the incompressible limit with an explicit rate of convergence is shown, when the volume viscosity tends to infinity. In contrast to [9,Theorem 1.3] and [7,Corollary 1.1] where vacuum was excluded, the convergence rate of the incompressible limit is obtained for the global solutions with vacuum, based on some $t$-growth and singular $t$-weighted estimates.</description>

      <title>Two types of compressible isotropic neo-Hookean material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{vol-iso} neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{mixed} neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann--Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767--2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and design of shell-based thermal lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis framework for investigating the thermal conductivity of shell lattice metamaterials, extending prior work from mechanical stiffness to heat transfer. Central to our analysis is a new metric, the asymptotic directional conductivity (ADC), which captures the leading-order influence of the middle surface geometry on the effective thermal conductivity in the vanishing-thickness limit. A convergence theorem is established for evaluating ADC, along with a sharp upper bound and the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving this bound. These results provide the first theoretical justification for the optimal thermal conductivity of triply periodic minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we show that ADC yields a third-order approximation to the effective conductivity of shell lattices at low volume fractions. To support practical design applications, we develop a discrete algorithm for computing and optimizing ADC over arbitrary periodic surfaces. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>A free boundary approach to non-scattering obstacles with vanishing contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by questions in inverse scattering theory, we develop free boundary methods in obstacle problems where both the solution and the right hand side of the equation may have varying sign. The key condition that prevents the appearance of corners is that the right hand side should be related to a harmonic polynomial. In this setting we prove new free boundary results not found in existing literature. Notably, our results imply that piecewise $C^1$ or convex penetrable obstacles in two dimensions and edge points in higher dimensions always cause nontrivial scattering of any incoming wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct local (in time) strong solutions in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^3)$, $s&gt;3/2$ and global weak solutions with finite energy for the Pauli-Darwin equation and the Pauli-Poisswell equation. These are the first rigorous results on these two models, which couple a 2-spinor with an electromagnetic field. The proofs rely on energy estimates for the strong solutions and compactness with an appropriate regularization for the weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Energy local minimizers for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on product spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of local minimizers with prescribed $L^2$-norm for the energy functional associated to the mass-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the product space $\mathbb{R}^N \times M^k$, where $(M^k,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, thus complementing the study of the mass-subcritical case performed by Terracini, Tzvetkov and Visciglia in [\emph{Anal. PDE} 2014, arXiv:1205.0342].
  First we prove that, for small $L^2$-mass, the problem admits local minimizers. Next, we show that when the $L^2$-norm is sufficiently small, the local minimizers are constants along $M^k$, and they coincide with those of the corresponding problem on $\mathbb{R}^N$. Finally, under certain conditions, we show that the local minimizers obtained above are nontrivial along $M^k$. The latter situation occurs, for instance, for every $M^k$ of dimension $k\ge 2$, with the choice of an appropriate metric $\hat g$, and in $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^k$, $k\ge 3$, where $\mathbb{S}^k$ is endowed with the standard round metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given suitable small, localized, $\mathbb U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in an elliptic gauge, we prove that they can be approximated by high-frequency vacuum spacetimes. This extends previous constructions where the limiting spacetime solves the Einstein-(multiple) null dust system (i.e., where the limiting massless Vlasov field can be written as a finite sum of delta measures). The proof proceeds by first approximating solutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system by solutions to the Einstein-(multiple) null dust system, then approximating solutions to the Einstein-null dust system by vacuum solutions. In the process, we take the number of families of dusts to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp estimates for the mean-field limit of weakly interacting diffusions with repulsive logarithmic interaction in arbitrary dimension. More precisely, we show that the associated partition function is uniformly bounded in the number of particles $N$ for an arbitrary bounded base measure. Combined with the modulated free energy method, this amounts to a logarithmic improvement in $N$ of the current best available closeness estimates in the literature. Our arguments are inspired by and borrow ideas from Nelson's classical construction of the $\varphi^4_2$ Euclidean quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Vegetation Patterning Can Both Impede and Trigger Critical Transitions from Savanna to Grassland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel ''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in a Swift-Hohenberg equation with spatially periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Swift-Hohenberg equation - a paradigm model for pattern formation - with "large" spatially periodic coefficients and find a Turing bifurcation that generates patterns whose leading order form is a Bloch wave modulated by solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau type equation. Since the interplay between forcing wavenumber and intrinsic wavenumber crucially shapes the spectrum and emerging patterns, we distinguish between resonant and non-resonant regimes. Extending earlier work that assumed asymptotically small coefficients, we tackle the more involved onset analysis produced by O(1) forcing and work directly in Bloch space, where the richer structure of the bifurcating solutions becomes apparent. This abstract framework is readily transferable to more complex systems, such as reaction-diffusion equations arising as dryland vegetation models, where topography induces spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Memory-Type Null Controllability of Heat Equations with Delay Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of null controllability for evolution equations that incorporate both memory and delay effects. The problem is particularly challenging due to the presence of memory integrals and delayed states, which necessitate strengthening the classical controllability requirement to ensure complete rest at the final time. To address this, we adopt the notion of Delay and memory-type null controllability, which demands the vanishing of the state, the accumulated memory term, and the influence of delay at the terminal time. Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the controllability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the corresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and establish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights are then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and memory terms. By leveraging Carleman estimates and time-dependent control strategies, we derive sufficient conditions under which controllability can be achieved. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate the critical role of moving control regions in neutralizing the effects of memory and delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on a phase field approximation of Plateau's problem. Inspired by Reifenberg's point of view, we introduce a model that combines the Ambrosio-Torterelli energy with a geodesic distance term, which can be considered as a generalization of the approach developed by Bonnivard, Lemenant and Santambrogio to approximate solutions to Steiner's problem. First, we present a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a single curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we detail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for numerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's problem are found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dirichlet problems for fractional Laplace equations of the form $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} u = f(x,u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;n$ where the nonlinearity $f(x,u) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \sigma_{i} u^{q_i} + \omega$ involves sublinear terms with $0&lt;q_{i}&lt;1$ and the coefficients $\sigma_{i}, \omega$ are nonnegative locally finite Borel measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We develop a potential theoretic approach for the existence of positive minimal solutions in Lorentz spaces to the problems under certain assumptions on $\sigma_{i}$ and $\omega$. The uniqueness properties of such solutions are discussed. Our techniques are also applicable to similar sublinear problems on uniform bounded domains when $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 2$, or on arbitrary domains with positive Green's functions in the classical case $\alpha =2$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a practical criterion that justifies the propagation and appearance of $L^{p}$-norms for the solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with very soft potentials without cutoff. Such criterion also provides a new conditional stability result for classical solutions to the equation. All results are quantitative. Our approach is inspired by a recent analogous result for the Landau equation derived in arXiv:2306.15729 and generalises existing conditional results related to higher integrability properties and stability of solutions to the Boltzmann equation with very soft potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to some classes of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs with non-monotone nonlinearities, which include the Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation (with all relevant fields and spin torques) and the convective Cahn--Hilliard/Allen--Cahn (CH-AC) equation with a proliferation term, in dimensions $d=1,2,3$. Firstly, we show the global well-posedness, as well as the existence of global and exponential attractors with finite fractal dimensions for these problems. In the case of the exchange-dominated LLBar equation and the CH-AC equation without convection, an estimate for the rate of convergence of the solution to the corresponding stationary state is given. Finally, we show the existence of a robust family of exponential attractors when $d\leq 2$. As a corollary, exponential attractor of the LLBar equation is shown to converge to that of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation in the limit of vanishing exchange damping, while exponential attractor of the convective CH-AC equation is shown to converge to that of the convective Allen--Cahn equation in the limit of vanishing diffusion coefficient.</description>

Abstract: We analyze blowup solutions in infinite time of the Neumann boundary value problem for the fully parabolic chemotaxis system with local sensing: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta(e^{-v}u)\qquad &amp;\mathrm{in}\ \Omega \times (0,\infty),
  v_t = \Delta v -v + u\qquad &amp;\mathrm{in}\ \Omega \times (0,\infty), \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a ball in two-dimensional space and with nonnegative radially symmetric initial data. In the case of the Keller--Segel system which has a similar mathematical structure with our system, it was shown that the solutions blow up in finite time if and only if $L\log L$ for the first component $u$ diverges in finite time. On the other hand, focusing on the variational structure induced by a signal-dependent motility function $e^{-v}$, we show that an unboundedness of $\int_\Omega e^v dx$ for the second component $v$ gives rise to blowup solutions in infinite time under the assumption of radial symmetry. Moreover we prove mass concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system develop a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. Here we investigate the weight of this singularity. Consequently it is shown that mass quantization may not occur; that is, the weight of the singularity can exceed $8\pi$ under the assumption of a uniform-in-time lower bound for the Lyapunov functional. This type of behavior cannot be observed in the Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of Mean Field Games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of global large-data solutions for the Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the Cauchy problem for the classical Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes (CNS) system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong, classical, and arbitrarily smooth solutions under large initial data, which has not been addressed in the existing literature. The key idea is to first derive an entropy-energy estimate for initial data with low regularity, by leveraging the intrinsic entropy structure of the system. Building on this foundation, we then obtain higher-order energy estimates for smoother initial data via a bootstrap argument, in which the parabolic nature of the CNS system plays a crucial role in the iterative control of regularity.</description>

      <title>Singular limits of anisotropic weak solutions to compressible magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim is to justify rigorously the so-called reduced magnetohydrodynamic model (abbreviated as RMHD), which is widely used in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. Motivated by physics, the focus is on plasmas that are simultaneously strongly magnetized and anisotropic. We consider conducting fluids that can be described by viscous and resistive barotropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations. The purpose is to study the asymptotic behaviour of global weak solutions, which do exist, for strongly anisotropic plasmas such as the large aspect ratio framework. We prove that such anisotropic weak solutions converge to the weak solutions of the RMHD equations. Rigorous justification of this limit is performed both in a periodic domain and in the whole space. It turns out that the resulting system is incompressible only in the perpendicular direction to the external strong magnetic field, whereas it involves compressible features in the parallel direction. In order to pass to the singular limit in the perpendicular direction we exploit, among others, tools elaborated for proving the low Mach number limit of compressible fluid flows such as the introduction of a fast oscillatory unitary group associated to the dynamics of transverse fast magnetosonic waves. In the parallel direction, we bring out compactness arguments and particular cancellations coming from the structure of our equations.</description>

      <title>Solving Mean-Field Games with Monotonicity Methods in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for proving the existence of solutions to stationary first-order mean-field games (MFGs) based on the theory of monotone operators in Banach spaces. We cast the coupled MFG system as a variational inequality, overcoming the limitations of prior Hilbert-space approaches that relied on high-order regularization and typically yielded only weak solutions in the monotone operator sense. In contrast, with our low-order regularization, we obtain strong solutions.
  Our approach addresses the non-coercivity of the underlying MFG operator through two key regularization strategies. First, by adding a low-order $p$-Laplacian term, we restore coercivity, derive uniform a priori estimates, and pass to the limit via Minty's method. This establishes, for the first time via monotonicity methods, the existence of strong solutions for models with both standard power-growth and singular congestion, with the latter requiring a careful restriction of the operator's domain. Second, for Hamiltonians with only minimal growth hypotheses, we regularize the Hamiltonian itself via infimal convolution to prove the existence of weak solutions.
  Our Banach-space framework unifies and extends earlier existence results. By avoiding high-order smoothing, it not only provides a more direct theoretical path but is also ideally suited for modern numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least $k + 2$ eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain. Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel variational principle.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Space-time White Noise and Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). It consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 6) and the appendices (A to C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. Chapter 5 discusses asymptotic properties of the solution to the stochastic heat equation such as existence of invariant and reversible measures, convergence in law to the invariant distribution, mixing and irreducibility. In Chapter 6, we prove a theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions in the weak sense. Then we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs: the Markov field property, asymptotic bounds on moments of solutions that are useful for studying long-time behavior of the solutions, a comparison theorem for the stochastic heat equation, an introduction to potential theory for SPDEs, and a study of SPDEs with rough initial conditions.
  Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation with spin-torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current-induced magnetisation dynamics in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures can be described by the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation with spin-torque terms. In this paper, we focus on the regime above the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution to the model in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, under an additional smallness assumption on the initial data if $d=3$. Relevant smoothing and decay estimates are also derived. We then propose a fully discrete, linearly implicit finite element scheme for the problem and prove that it achieves optimal-order convergence, assuming adequate regularity of the exact solution. In addition, we introduce an unconditionally energy-stable finite element method for the case of negligible non-adiabatic torque. This scheme is also shown to converge optimally and, in the absence of current, preserves energy dissipation at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical simulations that support the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Analytic extensions of $A_{\infty}$-weights on Lipschitz curves and their use in weighted Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $A_{\infty}$-weight on a Lipschitz curve $\Lambda$ in the plane can be extended analytically to the graph Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ above it. This problem was studied by C. Kenig [Ken80], who introduced the class $AE$ of well-behaved analytic extensions. Later, he and D. Jerison [JK82] added a Smirnov-type condition to the definition of this class.
  In this note, we show that this Smirnov-type condition is equivalent to an $H^1$-integrability condition. As a consequence, one of the conditions in the definition of $AE$ can be dropped. We use this simplification to apply C. Kenig's theory to prove results about weighted Hardy spaces. These are useful to study the Neumann problem in $\Omega$ with boundary data in weighted spaces.</description>
