      <title>A note concerning frames and geometric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One may associate several frames to a given polytope, such as its collection of vertices, edges, or facet normal vectors. In this note, we use these frames to generate geometric inequalities for the simplex in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and polytopes with $d+2$ vertices in dimension 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for star-shaped Kakeya sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1971, Cunningham proved that every star-shaped Kakeya set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfies $|E| \geq \pi/108$. In this paper, we show that Cunningham's bound is not optimal and can be improved to $|E| \geq \pi/98$.</description>

      <title>Categorical Tiling Theory: Constructing Directed Planar Tilings via Edge Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilings of the plane resemble the simplicial and other complexes from algebraic topology, but have not been studied from this perspective. We construct finite categories corresponding to polygons with labeled directed edges, and introduce the problem of modeling tilings of the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane as presheaves over such a category. Combinatorially, this amounts to choosing an ``alignment'' for a tiling: a direction for every edge and consistent labels for the edges of each polygonal tile. We show that for a fixed tiling, given a single alignment we can characterize every other alignment of the same tiling by comparison of the edge directions. We then construct a ``reflective'' alignment for any tiling with an even number of polygons at each vertex, and from this generate a large family of alignments with elegant symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension and failure of synthetic curvature bounds in the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geodesics, Hausdorff dimension, and curvature bounds of the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg group. Through an elementary variational approach, we provide a new proof of the structure of its maximizing geodesics, showing that they are lifts of hyperbolae coming from a Lorentzian isoperimetric problem in the Minkowski plane. We prove that the Lorentzian Hausdorff dimension of the space is $4$ and that the corresponding measure coincides with the Haar measure. We further establish a novel result in the spirit of the Ball-Box theorem, giving a uniform estimate of causal diamonds by anisotropic boxes. Finally, we show that the Heisenberg group satisfies neither the timelike curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ nor the timelike measure contraction property $\mathsf{TMCP}(K,N)$ for any values of the parameters $K$ and $N$, in sharp contrast with its sub-Riemannian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition under which the time marginal of the law of $\mu$-symmetric diffusion process $\mathsf{X}$ in the infinite dimensional configuration space $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is the unique Wasserstein $\mathsf{W}_{2, \mathsf{d}_\mathbf\Upsilon}$ $\mathsf{EVI}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy (a.k.a. Kullback-Leibler divergence) $\mathrm{Ent}_{\mu}$ on the space $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ of probability measures on $\mathbf \Upsilon$. Here, $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is equipped with the $\ell^2$-matching extended distance $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon$ and a Borel probability $\mu$ while $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ is endowed with the transportation extended distance $\mathsf W_{2, \mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon}$ with cost $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon^2$. Our results include the cases $\mu=\mathsf{sine}_2$ and $\mu= \mathsf{Airy}_2$ point processes, where the associated diffusion processes are unlabelled solutions to the infinite-dimensional Dyson-type stochastic differential equations in the bulk and soft-edge limit respectively. As an application, we show that the extended metric measure space $(\mathbf \Upsilon , \mathsf{d}_\mathbf \Upsilon, \mu)$ satisfies the Riemannian curvature-dimension (RCD) condition as well as the distorted Brunn-Minkowski inequality, the HWI inequality and several other functional inequalities. Finally we prove that the time marginal of the law of $\mathsf{X}$ propagates number rigidity and tail triviality.</description>

      <title>The twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture and relative hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of stable coarse algebras for metric spaces with bounded geometry, and formulate the twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture with respect to stable coarse algebras. We prove permanence properties of this conjecture under coarse equivalences, unions and subspaces.
  As an application, we study higher index theory for a group $G$ that is hyperbolic relative to a finite family of subgroups $\{H_1, H_2, \dots, H_N\}$. We prove that $G$ satisfies the twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture with respect to any stable coarse algebra if and only if each subgroup $H_i$ does.</description>

      <title>Learning from one graph: transductive learning guarantees via the geometry of small random worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix. Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log (k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Landscape and Erosion Distances for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes connections between three of the most prominent metrics used in the analysis of persistence diagrams in topological data analysis: the bottleneck distance, Patel's erosion distance, and Bubenik's landscape distance. Our main result shows that the erosion and landscape distances are equal, thereby bridging the former's natural category-theoretic interpretation with the latter's computationally convenient structure. The proof utilizes the category with a flow framework of de Silva et al., and leads to additional insights into the structure of persistence landscapes. Our equivalence result is applied to prove several results on the geometry of the erosion distance. We show that the erosion distance is not a length metric, and that its intrinsic metric is the bottleneck distance. We also show that the erosion distance does not coarsely embed into any Hilbert space, even when restricted to persistence diagrams arising from degree-0 persistent homology. Moreover, we show that erosion distance agrees with bottleneck distance on this subspace, so that our non-embeddability theorem generalizes several results in the recent literature.</description>

Abstract: We define bigraded persistent homology modules and bigraded barcodes of a finite pseudo-metric space X using the ordinary and double homology of the moment-angle complex associated with the Vietoris-Rips filtration of X.

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>

      <title>From Lipschitz embedding to Lipschitz equivalence between dust-like self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K,F\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be two dust-like self-similar sets sharing the same Hausdorff dimension. We consider when the mere existence of a Lipschitz embedding from $K$ to $F$ already implies their Lipschitz equivalence. Our main result is threefold: (1) if the Lipschitz image of $K$ intersects $F$ in a set of positive Hausdorff measure, then $K$ admits a Lipschitz surjection onto $F$; (2) if $F$ is in addition homogeneous, then the generating iterated function systems of $K, F$ should have algebraically dependent ratios and consequently, $K$ and $F$ are Lipschitz equivalent; (3) the Lipschitz equivalence can fail without the homogeneity assumption. This answers two questions in Balka and Keleti [Adv. Math. 446 (2024), 109669].</description>
