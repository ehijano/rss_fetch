      <title>Almost-Exact Simulation Scheme for Heston-type Models: Bermudan and American Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an Almost-Exact Simulation (AES) scheme was introduced for the Heston stochastic volatility model and tested for European option pricing. This paper extends this scheme for pricing Bermudan and American options under both Heston and double Heston models. The AES improves Monte Carlo simulation efficiency by using the non-central chi-square distribution for the variance process. We derive the AES scheme for the double Heston model and compare the performance of the AES schemes under both models with the Euler scheme. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the AES scheme in providing accurate option prices with reduced computational time, highlighting its robustness for both models. In particular, the AES achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency when the number of simulation steps matches the exercise dates for Bermudan options.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Rare-Event Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard rare-event simulation techniques require exact distributional specifications, which limits their effectiveness in the presence of distributional uncertainty. To address this, we develop a novel framework for estimating rare-event probabilities subject to such distributional model risk. Specifically, we focus on computing worst-case rare-event probabilities, defined as a distributionally robust bound against a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at a specific nominal distribution. By exploiting a dual characterization of this bound, we propose Distributionally Robust Importance Sampling (DRIS), a computationally tractable methodology designed to substantially reduce the variance associated with estimating the dual components. The proposed method is simple to implement and requires low sampling costs. Most importantly, it achieves vanishing relative error, the strongest efficiency guarantee that is notoriously difficult to establish in rare-event simulation. Our numerical studies confirm the superior performance of DRIS against existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk in the U.S. Banking System: An Analysis of Sentiment, Policy Shocks, and Spillover Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2023 U.S. banking crisis propagated not through direct financial linkages but through a high-frequency, information-based contagion channel. This paper moves beyond exploration analysis to test the "too-similar-to-fail" hypothesis, arguing that risk spillovers were driven by perceived similarities in bank business models under acute interest rate pressure. Employing a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model with 30-day rolling windows, a method uniquely suited for capturing the rapid network shifts inherent in a panic, we analyze daily stock returns for the four failed institutions and a systematically selected peer group of surviving banks vulnerable to the same risks from March 18, 2022, to March 15, 2023. Our results provide strong evidence for this contagion channel: total system connectedness surged dramatically during the crisis peak, and we identify SIVB, FRC, and WAL as primary net transmitters of risk while their perceived peers became significant net receivers, a key dynamic indicator of systemic vulnerability that cannot be captured by asset-by-asset analysis. We further demonstrate that these spillovers were significantly amplified by market sentiment (as measured by the VIX) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). By providing a clear conceptual framework and robust empirical validation, our findings confirm the persistence of systemic risks within the banking network and highlight the importance of real-time monitoring in strengthening financial stability.</description>

      <title>The Recalibration Conundrum: Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic hedging theory only makes sense in the setup of one given model, whereas the practice of dynamic hedging is just the opposite, with models fleeing after the data through daily recalibration. This is quite of a quantitative finance paradox. In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \&amp; Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions, in the direction of recalibration and model risks. Specifically, we extend to callable assets the HVA model risk approach of B{\'e}n{\'e}zet and Cr{\'e}pey (2024). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We show that a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>
