      <title>Simple biological controllers drive the evolution of soft modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems, with many interacting components, face high-dimensional environmental fluctuations, ranging from diverse nutrient deprivations to toxins, drugs, and physical stresses. Yet, many biological control mechanisms are `simple' -- they restore homeostasis through low-dimensional representations of the system's high-dimensional state. How do low-dimensional controllers maintain homeostasis in high-dimensional systems? We develop an analytically tractable model of integral feedback for complex systems in fluctuating environments. We find that selection for homeostasis leads to the emergence of a soft mode that provides the dimensionality reduction required for the functioning of simple controllers. Our theory predicts that simple controllers that buffer environmental perturbations (e.g., stress response pathways) will also buffer mutational perturbation, an equivalence we test using experimental data across ~5000 strains in the yeast knockout collection. We also predict, counterintuitively, that knocking out a simple controller will \emph{decrease} the dimensionality of the response to environmental change; we outline transcriptomics tests to validate this. Our work suggests an evolutionary origin of soft modes whose function is for dimensionality reduction in and of itself rather than direct function like allostery, with implications ranging from cryptic genetic variation to global epistasis.</description>

      <title>Threshold sensing yields optimal path formation in Physarum polycephalum -- but the mould does not know</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circuital network model for the foraging behaviour of Physarum polycephalum proves that threshold sensing yields the emergence of optimal paths that connect food sources and solve mazes. These findings are in agreement with the experimental evidence of emergent problem solving by P. polycephalum and provide insight into the evolution of primitive intelligence. Our results can also inspire the development of threshold-based algorithms for computing applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Caudal Fin Swimmers Incorporating Hydrodynamics, Kinematics, Morphology, and Scale Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body caudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in high-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high fidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide range of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between swimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the derivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin. This vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model forms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics. Scaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and swimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity simulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and experimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters that critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming performance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic locomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>A Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.</description>

      <title>Invariant non-equilibrium dynamics of transcriptional regulation optimize information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eukaryotic gene regulation is based on stochastic yet controlled promoter switching, during which genes transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states. Despite the molecular complexity of this process, recent studies reveal a surprising invariance of the "switching correlation time" ($T_C$), which characterizes promoter activity fluctuations, across gene expression levels in diverse genes and organisms. A biophysically plausible explanation for this invariance remains missing. Here, we show that this invariance imposes stringent constraints on minimal yet plausible models of transcriptional regulation, requiring at least four system states and non-equilibrium dynamics that break detailed balance. Using Bayesian inference on Drosophila gap gene expression data, we demonstrate that such models (i) accurately reproduce the observed $T_C$-invariance; (ii) remain robust to parameter perturbations; and (iii) maximize information transmission from transcription factor concentration to gene expression. These findings suggest that eukaryotic gene regulation has evolved to balance precision with reaction rate and energy dissipation constraints, favoring non-equilibrium architectures for optimal information transmission.</description>

      <title>Confinement controls bacterial spreading at all scales</title>

Abstract: Navigation of microorganisms is controlled by internal processes ultimately sensitive to mechanical or chemical signaling encountered along the path. In many natural environments, such as porous soils or physiological ducts, motile species alternate between bulk and surface motion displaying in each case, distinct kinematics. This inherent complexity is key to many practical biological and ecological issues involving spreading and contamination, essential for understanding the spatiotemporal structuring of populations in their environment. However grasping the interplay between geometrical confinement and kinematics driven by internal biological responses remains poorly understood from a physical and biological standpoint. Here, we address this question through experimental and theoretical analysis in the heuristic situation of two parallel confining surfaces. We track wild-type E. coli - a model peritrichous flagellated bacterium - in 3D over extended periods of time. We obtain the first experimental measurements of the emerging diffusivity and bulk/surface residence times as a function of confinement height and the specific chiral kinematics at surfaces. All experimental results are quantitatively reproduced, without parametric adjustment, by a non-Markovian stochastic (BV) model that incorporates the internal biochemical memory carried by a phosphorylated protein switching the motor rotation. By matching the results with a Markovian (memoryless) companion model, we derive an analytical expression for the diffusivity and demonstrate how confining walls influence microbial long-range dispersion. This approach also provides a general conceptual basis for understanding how microorganisms navigate complex environments, in which their movement alternates between bulk and surfaces.</description>

      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>
