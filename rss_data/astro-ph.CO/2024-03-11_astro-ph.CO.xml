      <title>A Ratio-Preserving Approach to Cosmological Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observables are particularly sensitive to key ratios of energy densities and rates, both today and at earlier epochs of the Universe. Well-known examples include the photon-to-baryon and the matter-to-radiation ratios. Equally important, though less publicized, are the ratios of pressure-supported to pressureless matter and the Thomson scattering rate to the Hubble rate around recombination, both of which observations tightly constrain. Preserving these key ratios in theories beyond the $\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model ensures broad concordance with a large swath of datasets when addressing cosmological tensions. We demonstrate that a mirror dark sector, reflecting a partial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry with the Standard Model, in conjunction with percent level changes to the visible fine-structure constant and electron mass which represent a \textit{phenomenological} change to the Thomson scattering rate, maintains essential cosmological ratios. Incorporating this ratio preserving approach into a cosmological framework significantly improves agreement to observational data ($\Delta\chi^2=-35.72$) and completely eliminates the Hubble tension with a cosmologically inferred $H_0 = 73.80 \pm 1.02$ km/s/Mpc when including the S$H_0$ES calibration in our analysis. While our approach is certainly nonminimal, it emphasizes the importance of keeping key ratios constant when exploring models beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Hawai`i Supernova Flows: A Peculiar Velocity Survey Using Over a Thousand Supernovae in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Hawai`i Supernova Flows project and present summary statistics of the first 1218 astronomical transients observed, 669 of which are spectroscopically classified Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). Our project is designed to obtain systematics-limited distances to SNe Ia while consuming minimal dedicated observational resources. This growing sample will provide increasing resolution into peculiar velocities as a function of position on the sky and redshift, allowing us to more accurately map the structure of dark matter. This can be used to derive cosmological parameters such as $\sigma_8$ and can be compared with large scale flow maps from other methods such as luminosity-line width or luminosity-velocity dispersion correlations in galaxies. Additionally, our photometry will provide a valuable test bed for analyses of SNe Ia incorporating near-infrared data. In this survey paper, we describe the methodology used to select targets, collect and reduce data, and calculate distances.</description>

      <title>HINORA, a method for detecting ring-like structures in 3D point distributions I: application to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method - called HINORA (HIgh-NOise RANdom SAmple Consensus) - for the identification of regular structures in 3D point distributions. Motivated by the possible existence of the so called Council of Giants, i.e. a ring of twelve massive galaxies surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet with a radius of 3.75 Mpc, we apply HINORA to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue confirming its existence. When varying the lower limit of K-band luminosity of the galaxy entering the catalogue, we further report on the existence of another ring-like structure in the Local Volume that now contains the Milky Way and M31. However, this newly found structure is dominated by low-mass (satellite) galaxies. While we here simply present the novel method as well as its first application to observational data, follow-up work using numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation shall shed light into the origin of such regular patterns in the galaxy distribution. Further, the method is equally suited to identify similar (or even different) structures in various kinds of astrophysical data (e.g. locating the actual 'baryonic-acoustic oscillation spheres' in galaxy redshift surveys).</description>

      <title>Constraining dark matter model using 21cm line intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the mock 21cm maps from the post-reionization epoch to show that the $\Lambda$CDM and warm dark matter (WDM) model can be distinguished for WDM particle masses $m_{FD}&lt;3$ keV, under the assumption of thermal production of WDM following the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution. We demonstrate that the CNN is a potent tool in distinguishing the dark matter masses, highlighting its sensitivity to the subtle differences in the 21cm maps produced by varying dark matter masses. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass different WDM production mechanisms, recognizing that the dark matter production mechanism in the early Universe is among the sources of the most significant uncertainty for the dark matter model building.
  In this work, given the mass of the dark matter, we discuss the feasibility of discriminating four different WDM models: Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution model, neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu$MSM), Dodelson-Widrow (DW), and Shi-Fuller (SF) model. For instance, when the WDM mass is 2 keV, we show that one can differentiate between CDM, FD, $\nu$MSM, and DW models while discerning between the DW and SF models turns out to be challenging. Our results reinforce the viability of the CNN as a robust analysis for 21cm maps and shed light on its potential to unravel the features associated with different dark matter production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing by Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters as gravitational lenses play a unique role in astrophysics and cosmology: they permit mapping the dark matter distribution on a range of scales; they reveal the properties of high and intermediate redshift background galaxies that would otherwise be unreachable with telescopes; they constrain the particle nature of dark matter and are a powerful probe of global cosmological parameters, like the Hubble constant. In this review we summarize the current status of cluster lensing observations and the insights they provide, and offer a glimpse into the capabilities that ongoing, and the upcoming next generation of telescopes and surveys will deliver. While many open questions remain, cluster lensing promises to remain at the forefront of discoveries in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our primary objective is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We incorporate recent datasets comprising 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points. Additionally, we integrate the most recent determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter helps alleviate bias, enhance precision, and improve dataset compatibility. By simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix, errors are reduced. The obtained values of ($H_{0}$) and ($r_{d}$) are consistent with those from Planck and SDSS. Cosmography tests offer insights into the dynamics of both models, aiding our understanding of cosmological evolution. Statefinder diagnostics deepen our understanding of cosmic expansion dynamics and aid in distinguishing between different cosmological models. The $o_{m}$ Diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls in the phantom region and GCCM falls in the phantom quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) provide support for all models under consideration, indicating that each model offers a plausible explanation. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit compared to others. Additionally, validation through the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, further reinforcing their credibility in explaining the observed data.</description>

      <title>Effects of a dark matter caustic passing through the Oort Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Towards $21$-cm intensity mapping at $z=2.28$ with uGMRT using the tapered gridded estimator -- IV. Wideband analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Wideband Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE), which incorporates baseline migration and variation of the primary beam pattern for neutral hydrogen (${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$) 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) with large frequency bandwidth radio-interferometric observations. Here we have analysed $394-494 \, {\rm MHz}$ $(z = 1.9 - 2.6)$ uGMRT data to estimate the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ from which we have removed the foregrounds using the polynomial fitting (PF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) methods developed in our earlier work. Using the residual $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ to estimate the mean squared 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation $\Delta^2(k)$, we find that this is consistent with $0 \pm 2 \sigma$ in several $k$ bins. The resulting $2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta^2(k) &lt; (4.68)^2 \, \rm{mK^2}$ at $k=0.219\,\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ is nearly $15$ times tighter than earlier limits obtained from a smaller bandwidth ($24.4 \, {\rm MHz}$) of the same data. The $2\sigma$ upper limit $[\Omega_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}} b_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}] &lt; 1.01 \times 10^{-2}$ is within an order of magnitude of the value expected from independent estimates of the ${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$ mass density $\Omega_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}$ and the ${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$ bias $b_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}$. The techniques used here can be applied to other telescopes and frequencies, including $\sim 150 \, {\rm MHz}$ Epoch of Reionization observations.</description>

      <title>Radial Tully-Fisher relation and the local variance of Hubble parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the well-established Radial Tully-Fisher (RTF) relation observed in a `large' (843) sample of local galaxies, we report the maximum allowed variance in the Hubble parameter, $H_0$. We estimate the total intrinsic scatter in the magnitude of the RTF relation(s) implementing a cosmological model-independent cosmographic expansion. We find that the maximum allowed local variation in our baseline analysis, using 4 RTF relations in the galaxy sample is $\Delta H_0/H_0 \lesssim 3 \%$ at a $95\%$ C.L. significance. Which is implied form a constraint of $\Delta H_0/H_0 = 0.54^{+1.32}_{-1.37} \%$ estimated at $D_{\rm{L}}\sim 10\, [\rm{Mpc}]$. Using only one `best-constrained' radial bin we report a conservative $95\%$ C.L. limit of $\Delta H_0/H_0 \lesssim 4 \%$. Through our estimate of maximum variation, we propose a novel method to validate several late-time/local modifications put forth to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We find that within the range of the current galaxy sample redshift distribution $10 \, [\rm{Mpc}] \le D_{\rm{L}} \le 140\, [\rm{Mpc}]$, it is highly unlikely to obtain a variation of $\Delta H_0/H_0 \sim 9\%$, necessary to alleviate the $H_0$-tension. However, we also elaborate on the possible alternative inferences when the innermost radial bin is included in the analysis. Alongside the primary analysis of fitting the individual RTF relations independently, we propose and perform a joint analysis of the RTF relations useful to create a pseudo-standardizable sample of galaxies. We also test for the spatial variation of $H_0$, finding that the current samples' galaxies distributed only in the southern hemisphere support the null hypothesis of isotropy, within the allowed noise levels.</description>

      <title>Fully non-Gaussian Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a particular class of primordial signals which are sourced at second-order in perturbation theory whenever a scalar fluctuation of the metric is present. They form a guaranteed Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) that, depending on the amplification of primordial scalar fluctuations, can be detected by GW detectors. The amplitude and the frequency shape of the scalar-induced SGWB can be influenced by the statistical properties of the scalar density perturbations. In this work we study the intuitive physics behind SIGWs and we analyze the imprints of local non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation on the GW spectrum. We consider all the relevant non-Gaussian contributions up to fifth-order in the scalar seeds without any hierarchy, and we derive the related GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis to understand to which accuracy non-Gaussianity can be constrained with the LISA detector, which will be sensitive in the milli-Hertz frequency band. We find that LISA, neglecting the impact of astrophysical foregrounds, will be able to measure the amplitude, the width and the peak of the spectrum with an accuracy up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, while non-Gaussianity can be measured up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our non-Gaussianity expansion on the fraction of Primordial Black Holes.</description>

      <title>Particle shells from relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Calibrate a Semi-analytic Model of the First Stars and Galaxies to the Renaissance Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method that calibrates a semi-analytic model to the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with high-redshift galaxy formation. This approach combines the strengths of semi-analytic techniques and hydrodynamical simulations, enabling the extension to larger volumes and lower redshifts inaccessible to simulations due to computational expense. Using a sample of Renaissance star formation histories (SFHs) from an average density region of the Universe, we construct a four parameter prescription for metal-enriched star formation characterized by an initial bursty stage followed by a steady stage where stars are formed at constant efficiencies. Our model also includes a treatment of Population III star formation where a minimum halo mass and log-normal distribution of stellar mass are adopted to match the numerical simulations. Star formation is generally well reproduced for halos with masses $\lesssim$$10^{9} M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. Between $11&lt;z&lt;25$ our model produces metal-enriched star formation rate densities (SFRDs) that typically agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 for the average density region. Additionally, the total metal-enriched stellar mass only differs from Renaissance by about $10\%$ at $z \sim 11$. For regions that are either more overdense or rarefied not included in the calibration, we produce metal-enriched SFRDs that agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 at high-$z$, but eventually differ by higher factors for later times. This is likely due to environmental dependencies not included in the model. Our star formation prescriptions can easily be adopted in other analytic or semi-analytic works to match our calibration to Renaissance.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational M\'enage \`a Trois: leptogenesis, primordial gravitational wave &amp; PBH-induced reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of %dynamically producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: The violations of parity and Lorentz symmetries in gravity can change the propagating properties of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmological background, which can arise from a large number of parity- and Lorentz-violating theories. In this paper, through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from the standard GW propagation in general relativity, we study both the parity- and Lorentz-violating effects on the power spectra and the polarization of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) during the slow-roll inflation. To this end, we calculate explicitly the power spectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically by using the uniform asymptotic approximation. It is shown that the new contributions to power spectra contain two parts, one from the parity-violating terms and the other from the Lorentz-violating terms. While the Lorentz-violating terms can only affect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce nonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand polarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Spinfoams, $\gamma$-duality and parity violation in primordial gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ appears as a coupling constant in the spinfoam dynamics of loop quantum gravity and can be understood as a measure of gravitational parity violation via a duality rotation. We investigate an effective field theory for gravity and a scalar field, with dynamics given by a $\gamma$-dual action obtained via a duality rotation of a parity-non-violating one. The resulting relation between the coupling constants of parity-even and parity-odd higher-curvature terms is determined by $\gamma$, opening the possibility of its measurement in the semiclassical regime. For a choice of $\gamma$-dual effective action, we study cosmic inflation and show that the observation of a primordial tensor polarization, together with the tensor tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, provides a measurement of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and, therefore, of the scale of discreteness of the quantum geometry of space.</description>

      <title>New slow-roll approximations for inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>Estimating the mass of galactic components using machine learning algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of the bulge and disk massses, the main baryonic components of a galaxy, can be performed using various approaches, but their implementation tend to be challenging as they often rely on strong assumptions about either the baryon dynamics or the dark matter model. In this work, we present an alternative method for predicting the masses of galactic components, including the disk, bulge, stellar and total mass, using a set of machine learning algorithms: KNN-neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN). The rest-frame absolute magnitudes in the ugriz-photometric system were selected as input features, and the training was performed using a sample of spiral galaxies hosting a bulge from Guo's mock catalogue \citep{Guo-Catalog} derived from the Millennium simulation. In general, all the algorithms provide good predictions for the galaxy's mass components ranging from $10^9\,M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\,M_\odot$, corresponding to the central region of the training mass domain; however, the NN give rise to the most precise predictions in comparison to other methods. Additionally, to test the performance of the NN architecture, we used a sample of observed galaxies from the SDSS survey whose mass components are known. We found that the NN can predict the luminous masses of disk-dominant galaxies within the same range of magnitudes that for the synthetic sample up to a $99\%$ level of confidence, while mass components of galaxies hosting larger bulges are well predicted up to $95\%$ level of confidence. The NN algorithm can also bring up scaling relations between masses of different components and magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Early dark energy constraints with late-time expansion marginalization</title>

Abstract: Early dark energy (EDE) is an extension to the $\Lambda$CDM model, proposed to reduce the tension between the measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and from the local cosmic distance ladder. However, this model increases the $S_8$ tension between CMB and large scale structure measurements. Analyses of galaxy clustering and lensing correlation functions report a decreased preference for EDE and its effect on the Hubble tension. Smooth dark energy models affect growth of structure through the background expansion. In this work, we study the inclusion of a general, smooth late-time dark energy modification in combination with EDE and obtain constraints on EDE marginalized over the late-time expansion. We assess the impact on the $S_8$ and Hubble tensions. In order to generalize the late expansion, we use a late dark energy fluid model with a piecewise constant equation of state $w(z)$ over 3, 5 and 10 redshift bins in the window $z \in [0,3]$. We show that, when analyzing ACT and Planck CMB data combined with Pantheon supernovae, BAO from 6dF, SDSS and BOSS, Planck 2018 CMB lensing and Dark Energy Survey cosmic shear and clustering data, the inclusion of a general smooth dark energy modification at late times has no significant effect on $S_8$ and EDE parameter constraints. Using the aforementioned datasets, the EDE fraction constraint with late-time expansion marginalization is $f_\mathrm{EDE} = 0.067^{+0.019}_{-0.027}$ using 3 redshift bins, with similar results for 5 and 10 redshift bins. This work shows that in order to solve simultaneously the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions, one needs a mechanism for increasing the clustering of matter at late times different from a simple change in the background evolution of late dark energy.

      <description>arXiv:2304.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme based on the marked correlation function to probe gravity using the large-scale structure of the Universe. We illustrate our approach by applying it to simulations of the metric-variation $f(R)$ modified gravity theory and general relativity (GR). The modifications to the equations in $f(R)$ gravity lead to changes in the environment of large-scale structures that could, in principle, be used to distinguish this model from GR. Applying the Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, we use the observed number density and two-point clustering to fix the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model parameters and build mock galaxy catalogues from both simulations. To generate a mark for galaxies when computing the marked correlation function we estimate the local density using a Voronoi tessellation. Our approach allows us to isolate the contribution to the uncertainty in the predicted marked correlation function that arises from the range of viable HOD model parameters, in addition to the sample variance error for a single set of HOD parameters. This is critical for assessing the discriminatory power of the method. In a companion paper we apply our new scheme to a current large-scale structure survey.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory challenge for cosmological parameters estimation II.: Matter power spectrum in redshift space</title>

Abstract: Constraining cosmological parameters from large-scale structure observations requires precise and accurate tools to compute its properties. While perturbation theory (PT) approaches can serve this purpose, exploration of large parameter space is challenging due to the potentially large computational cost of such calculations. In this study, we show that a response function approach applied to the regularized PT (RegPT) model at 2-loop order, plus correction terms induced by redshift space distortion effects, can reduce the runtime by a factor of 50 compared to direct integration. We illustrate the performance of this approach by performing the parameter inference of five fundamental cosmological parameters from the redshift space power spectrum measured from $N$-body simulations as mock measurements, and inferred cosmological parameters are directly compared with parameters used to generate initial conditions of the simulations. From this \textit{PT challenge} analysis, the constraining power of cosmological parameters and parameter biases are quantified with the survey volume and galaxy number density expected for the \textit{Euclid} mission at the redshift $z = 1$ as a function of the maximum wave-number of data points $k_\mathrm{max}$. We find that RegPT with correction terms reproduces the input cosmological parameters without bias up to maximum wave-number $k_\mathrm{max}= 0.18 \, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Moreover, RegPT+, which introduces one free parameter to RegPT to handle the damping feature on small scales, delivers the best performance among the examined models and achieves tighter constraints without significant parameter bias for higher maximum wave-number $k_\mathrm{max} = 0.21 \, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}$ - $E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Is the Radio Source Dipole from NVSS Consistent with the CMB and $\Lambda$CDM?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dipole moment in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is thought to originate from the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB frame. Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related ``kinematic dipole'' and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot-noise and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than $\lesssim 2\sigma$. We conclude that the NVSS dipole is consistent with a kinematic origin for the CMB dipole within $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the marked correlation function test proposed by Armijo et al. (Paper I) to samples of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III. The test assigns a density-dependent mark to galaxies in the estimation of the projected marked correlation function. Two gravity models are compared: general relativity (GR) and $f(R)$ gravity. We build mock catalogues which, by construction, reproduce the measured galaxy number density and two-point correlation function of the LRG samples, using the halo occupation distribution model (HOD). A range of HOD models give acceptable fits to the observational constraints, and this uncertainty is fed through to the error in the predicted marked correlation functions. The uncertainty from the HOD modelling is comparable to the sample variance for the SDSS-III LRG samples. Our analysis shows that current galaxy catalogues are too small for the test to distinguish a popular $f(R)$ model from GR. However, upcoming surveys with a better measured galaxy number density and smaller errors on the two-point correlation function, or a better understanding of galaxy formation, may allow our method to distinguish between viable gravity models.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges.The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.332^{+1.246}_{-0.237}$ and $Q =-0.0312^{+0.0312}_{-0.0085}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological Poisson equation in a model-independent way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can test the cosmological Poisson equation by requiring only the validity of three main assumptions: the energy-momentum conservation equations of matter, the equivalence principle, and the cosmological principle. We first point out that one can only measure the combination ${\mathcal M}\equiv \Omega_m^{(0)}\mu$, where $\mu$ quantifies the deviation of the Poisson equation from the standard one and $\Omega_m^{(0)}$ is the fraction of matter density at present. Then we employ a recent model-independent forecast for the growth rate $f(z)$ and the expansion rate $E(z)$ to obtain constraints on ${\mathcal M}$ for a survey that approximates a combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We conclude that a constant ${\mathcal M}$ can be measured with a relative error $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}}=4.5\%$, while if ${\mathcal M}$ is arbitrarily varying in redshift, it can be measured only to within $13.4\%$ (1 $\sigma$ c.l.) at redshift $z=0.9$, and 15-22\% up to $z=1.5$. We also project our constraints on some parametrizations of ${\mathcal M}$ proposed in literature, while still maintaining model-independence for the background expansion, the power spectrum shape, and the non-linear corrections. Generally speaking, as expected, we find much weaker model-independent constraints than found so far for such models. This means that the cosmological Poisson equation remains quite open to various alternative gravity and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Caustic and hydrostatic mass bias: Implications for modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and perform a joint analysis of the two different mass estimates of galaxy clusters, namely the hydrostatic and caustic techniques. Firstly, we show comprehensively that the mass bias between these two techniques can be possibly alleviated when cluster-specific assumptions constrained using the hydrostatic technique are utilized within the caustic technique. While at face value this demotes the caustic technique from a completely independent method, this allows one to further tighten the constraints on the cluster mass and subsequently, allow us to test modifications to gravity. Implementing the aforementioned formalism for two well-observed massive galaxy clusters, A2029 and A2142, we highlight the proof of concept. In the current implementation, we use this method to constrain the Chameleon screening and Vainshtein screening. As anticipated, we show that the joint analysis can help improve the constraints on these modified gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of dark matter subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data with a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a characteristic suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, and the $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Consistency Condition for Slow-roll and Rapid-turn Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize our work on a consistency condition for inflation in two-field cosmological models, in the regime of rapid turn and third-order slow roll. To ensure a sustained inflationary period of this type, one needs to satisfy a certain relation between the scalar potential and the scalar field-space metric. We explain the derivation of this condition. Furthermore, we argue that, generically, the rapid-turn phase tends to be short-lived.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like ultralight dark matter from observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may consist of axion-like particles (ALPs). When polarized electromagnetic radiation passes through the dark-matter media, interaction with background ALPs affects the polarization of photons. The condensate of axionic dark matter experiences periodic oscillations, and the period of the oscillations is of order of years for ultra-light dark matter. This would result in observable periodic changes in the polarization plane, determined by the phases of the ALP field at the Earth and at the source. In this paper, we use recent polarimetric observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk performed in different years to demonstrate the lack of changes of polarization angles, and hence to constrain masses and photon couplings of the hypothetical axion-like ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Opening windows with Isospin-Violating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of isospin-violating dark matter-nucleon interactions on direct detection constraints in the regime of small dark matter mass and large scattering cross section. Isospin-violation can lead to both reductions in sensitivity (due to a reduced cross section for scattering with nuclei in the detector) and enhancements in sensitivity (due to a reduced cross section for scattering in the overburden). Isospin-violating effects can thus open up some closed regions of parameter space, while closing off other regions.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Axion Domain Wall Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion can solve the Strong CP Problem and be the dark matter of our universe. If the PQ symmetry breaking scale associated with the axion is below the inflationary reheating temperature, axion strings and domain walls populate the universe. Most of these strings and walls decay away into axion dark matter, but a small subset of the walls will be self-enclosed surfaces that are not attached to any strings. These enclosed walls can collapse in on themselves, compressing a large amount of energy into a small volume and potentially forming primordial black holes (PBHs). We study the number density and dynamics of these self-enclosed walls, taking into account their size distribution, Hubble expansion, asphericities, and all stages of domain wall dynamics using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical approaches. We find that axion models with a high axion decay constant $f_a$, such as those of interest in early matter-dominated cosmologies, yield a PBH abundance potentially observable by future gravitational lensing surveys. We note that the formalism developed here is also useful for predicting relic PBH abundances in other models that exhibit unstable domain walls.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine Dirac Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal framework that realises successful Dirac Leptogenesis through the Affleck-Dine mechanism. A single right-handed neutrino and a neutrinophillic Higgs doublet are introduced to the Standard Model, which couple via a Yukawa interaction. The inflationary setting is induced by a combination of the two Higgs doublets, with their global symmetry violating interactions leading to a net charge generation via the Affleck-Dine mechanism. This simple Standard Model extension exhibits a unique and connected set of phenomenological implications including the resultant baryon asymmetry, inflationary predictions, cosmological implications, relic right-handed neutrinos, and its low energy phenomenology, while also being able to be embedded in various neutrino mass generating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Inelastic Dark Matter from Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different dark matter (DM) candidates could have different types of DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions. For direct detection experiments, this leads to diversity in the recoil spectra, where both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scatterings may contribute. Furthermore, kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can also play an important role in shaping the recoil spectra. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale and the DM mass-splitting ranges from 1keV to 30keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. Hence, it is important to perform combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.</description>
