      <title>Bayesian Model-based Generation of Synthetic Unbalanced Distribution Networks Incorporating Reliability Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world power distribution data are often inaccessible due to privacy and security concerns, highlighting the need for tools for generating realistic synthetic networks. Existing methods typically overlook critical reliability metrics such as the Customer Average Interruption Frequency Index (CAIFI) and the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI). Moreover, these methods often neglect phase consistency during the design stage, necessitating the use of a separate phase assignment algorithm. This work proposes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) that generates phase-consistent unbalanced three-phase distribution systems, and incorporates reliability indices. The BHM learns the joint distribution of phase configuration, power demand, and reliability indices from a reference network, conditioning these attributes on topological features. We apply the proposed methodology to generate synthetic power distribution networks in Brazil, and validated it on known Brazilian networks. The results show that the BHM accurately reproduces the distributions of phase allocation, power demand, and reliability metrics on the training system. Furthermore, in out-of-sample validation on unseen data, the model generates phase-consistent networks and accurately predicts the reliability indices for the synthetic systems. The generated networks are also electrically feasible: three-phase power flows converge and voltages remain within typical operating limits, enabling studies of planning, reliability, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability Analysis of Multi-scale Voltage Dynamics Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage stability in modern power systems involves coupled dynamics across multiple time scales. Conventional methods based on time-scale separation or static stability margins may overlook instabilities caused by the coupling of slow and fast transients. Uncertainty in operating conditions further complicates stability assessment, and high computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations limit its applicability to multi-scale dynamics. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based framework for probabilistic reachability analysis of multi-scale voltage dynamics. By formulating each instability mechanism as a distinct absorbing state and introducing a multi-critic architecture for mechanism-specific learning, the proposed method enables consistent learning of risk probabilities associated with multiple instability types within a unified framework. The approach is demonstrated on a four-bus system with load tap changers and over-excitation limiters, illustrating effectiveness of the proposed learning-based reachability analysis in identifying and quantifying the mechanisms leading to voltage collapse.</description>

      <title>Learning-based data-enabled moving horizon estimation with application to membrane-based biological wastewater treatment process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-enabled moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach for nonlinear systems. While the approach is formulated by leveraging Koopman theory, its implementation does not require explicit Koopman modeling. Lifting functions are learned from the state and input data of the original nonlinear system to project the system trajectories into the lifted space, where the resulting trajectories implicitly describe the Koopman representation for the original nonlinear system. A convex data-enabled MHE formulation is developed to provide real-time state estimates of the Koopman representation, from which the states of the nonlinear system can be reconstructed. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the estimation error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using a membrane-based biological water treatment process.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous State Estimation and Online Model Learning in a Soft Robotic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating complex real-world systems, such as soft robots, can benefit from precise predictive control schemes that require accurate state and model knowledge. This knowledge is typically not available in practical settings and must be inferred from noisy measurements. In particular, it is challenging to simultaneously estimate unknown states and learn a model online from sequentially arriving measurements. In this paper, we show how a recently proposed gray-box system identification tool enables the estimation of a soft robot's current pose while at the same time learning a bending stiffness model. For estimation and learning, we rely solely on a nominal constant-curvature robot model and measurements of the robot's base reactions (e.g., base forces). The estimation scheme -- relying on a marginalized particle filter -- allows us to conveniently interface nominal constant-curvature equations with a Gaussian Process (GP) bending stiffness model to be learned. This, in contrast to estimation via a random walk over stiffness values, enables prediction of bending stiffness and improves overall model quality. We demonstrate, using real-world soft-robot data, that the method learns a bending stiffness model online while accurately estimating the robot's pose. Notably, reduced multi-step forward-prediction errors indicate that the learned bending-stiffness GP improves overall model quality.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Network LQG Mean Field Games with Heterogeneous Populations via Integral Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a data-driven solution for infinite horizon linear quadratic Gaussian Mean Field Games with network-coupled heterogeneous agent populations where the dynamics of the agents are unknown. The solution technique relies on Integral Reinforcement Learning and Kleinman's iteration for solving algebraic Riccati equations (ARE). The resulting algorithm uses trajectory data to generate network-coupled MFG strategies for agents and does not require parameters of agents' dynamics. Under technical conditions on the persistency of excitation and on the existence of unique stabilizing solution to the corresponding AREs, the learned network-coupled MFG strategies are shown to converge to their true values.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Performance-Aware Hybrid-Gain-Based Robust Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a prescribed performance function aware hybrid gain finite time sliding mode control framework for a class of nonlinear systems subject to matched disturbances. The hybrid gain structure ensures bounded control effort while retaining finite time convergence, and the incorporation of PPFs enables explicit enforcement of transient performance requirements. Theoretical guarantees are first established for first order systems, characterizing finite time convergence, disturbance rejection, and residual bounds. The approach is then extended to second order dynamics, where a sliding manifold is designed using PPF constraints to facilitate controlled shaping of position and velocity transients. Simulation studies illustrate the proposed design under matched peak control conditions. Comparative results for second-order systems demonstrate that, while a well tuned non-PPF hybrid gain controller achieves competitive tracking performance, the PPF-aware formulation strictly enforces prescribed transient constraints and yields consistent reductions of approximately 9 to 12 percent in integral error and control energy metrics without increasing peak actuation effort.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Virtual Queue Coordination via Uncertainty-Aware Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative virtual queueing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate airport surface congestion while preserving airline autonomy over aircraft-level pushback decisions. A central coordinator can regulate aggregate pushback capacity but cannot directly control which specific aircraft are released, limiting its ability to steer system-level performance. We propose a noncooperative coordination mechanism for collaborative virtual queueing based on the correlated equilibrium concept, which enables the coordinator to provide incentive-compatible recommendations on aircraft-level pushback decisions without overriding airline autonomy. To account for uncertainty in airlines' internal cost assessments, we introduce chance constraints into the correlated equilibrium formulation. This formulation provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on incentive compatibility, allowing the coordinator to adjust the confidence level with which airlines are expected to follow the recommended actions. We further propose a scalable algorithm for computing chance-constrained correlated equilibria by exploiting a reduced-rank structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method scales to realistic traffic levels up to 210 eligible pushbacks per hour, reduces accumulated delay by up to approximately 8.9% compared to current first-come-first-served schemes, and reveals a trade-off between confidence level, deviation robustness, and achievable cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Segment-Based Two-Loop Adaptive Iterative Learning Control for Spacecraft Position and Attitude Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity operations of rigid bodies, such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking, require precise tracking of both position and attitude over finite time intervals. These operations are often repeated under uncertain conditions, with unknown but repeatable parameters and disturbances. Adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) is well suited to such tasks, as it can track desired trajectories while learning unknown, iteration-invariant signals or parameters. However, conventional adaptive ILC faces two challenges: (i) the coupling between rotational and translational dynamics complicates the design of the two coordinated learning loops for position and attitude, and (ii) standard adaptive ILC designs cannot guarantee bounded control inputs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-number-based, segment-based two-loop adaptive ILC framework for simultaneous high-precision position and attitude tracking. The framework employs two learning loops that interact through a dual-number representation of tracking errors, combining position and attitude errors into a single mathematical object for unified control design. A segment-based dynamic projection mechanism ensures that both parameter estimates and control inputs remain bounded without prior knowledge of uncertainties. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances tracking performance under unknown but repeatable uncertainties and strong rotational-translational coupling.</description>

      <title>DC Microgrids with Nested Nonlinear Distributed Control: Scalable Large-Signal Stability and Voltage Containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a cyber-physical DC microgrid employing a nonlinear distributed consensus-based control scheme for coordinated integration and management of distributed generating units within an expandable framework. Relying on nested primary andsecondary control loops; a (distributed) outer-loop and a (decentralized) inner-loop, the controller achieves proportional current sharing among all distributed generation units, while dynamically operating within predefined voltage limits. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis establishes a scalable global exponential stability certificate under some tuning conditions and sufficient time-scale separation between the control loops, based on singular perturbation theory. An optimization-based tuning strategy is then formulated to identify and subsequently diminish unstable operating conditions. In turn, various practical tuning strategies are introduced to provide stable operations while facilitating near-optimal proportional current sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework and tuning approaches are finally supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Bound Robust Optimization Approach for Renewable-Based VPP Market Participation Considering Intra-Hourly Uncertainty Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing transition of electricity markets worldwide from hourly to intra-hourly bidding, market participants--especially Renewable Energy Sources (RES)--gain improved opportunities to adjust energy and reserve schedules and to benefit from more accurate higher-resolution forecasts. However, this shift requires participants to update decision-making frameworks and to strengthen uncertainty management in order to fully exploit the new market potential. In particular, Renewable-Based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) aggregating dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES must account for these changes through market-oriented scheduling methods that efficiently address multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, RES generation, and demand consumption. In this vein, this paper proposes a multi-bound robust optimization framework to simultaneously capture these uncertainties, explicitly incorporate intra-hourly variability, and differentiate the deviation levels (frequent, moderate deviations and rare, extreme ones) of uncertain parameters. The proposed approach yields less conservative and more implementable bidding and scheduling decisions, thus improving RVPP profitability in both energy and reserve markets. Simulation studies compare the proposed method with standard robust optimization and evaluate the operational, market-strategy, and economic impacts of quarter-hourly versus hourly market resolution. Results indicate that the normalized absolute differences, across different uncertainty-handling strategies, between hourly and 15-minute schedules are 18.0--34.2% for day-ahead traded energy, and 28.7--65.6% and 10.1--16.3% for upward and downward reserve traded in the secondary reserve market, respectively. Furthermore, relative to classic robust optimization, the proposed multi-bound approach increases profit by 24.9--49.2% across the considered strategies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical parameter estimation for distributed networked systems: a dynamic consensus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel two-stage distributed framework to globally estimate constant parameters in a networked system, separating shared information from local estimation. The first stage uses dynamic average consensus to aggregate agents' measurements into surrogates of centralized data. Using these surrogates, the second stage implements a local estimator to determine the parameters. By designing an appropriate consensus gain, the persistence of excitation of the regressor matrix is achieved, and thus, exponential convergence of a local Gradient Estimator (GE) is guaranteed. The framework facilitates its extension to switched network topologies, quantization, and the heterogeneous substitution of the GE with a Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) estimator, which supports relaxed excitation requirements.</description>

      <title>Unified Eigenvalue-Eigenspace Criteria for Functional Properties of Linear Systems and the Generalized Separation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical controllability and observability characterise reachability and reconstructibility of the full system state and admit equivalent geometric and eigenvalue-based Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests. Motivated by large-scale and networked systems where only selected linear combinations of the state are of interest, this paper studies functional generalisations of these properties. A PBH-style framework for functional system properties is developed, providing necessary and sufficient spectral characterisations. The results apply uniformly to diagonalizable and non-diagonalizable systems and recover the classical PBH tests as special cases.
  Two new intrinsic notions are introduced: intrinsic functional controllability, and intrinsic functional stabilizability. These intrinsic properties are formulated directly in terms of invariant subspaces associated with the functional and provide verifiable conditions for the existence of admissible augmentations required for functional controller design and observer-based functional controller design. The intrinsic framework enables the generalized separation principle at the functional level, establishing that functional controllers and functional observers can be designed independently. Illustrative examples demonstrate the theory and highlight situations where functional control and estimation are possible despite lack of full-state controllability or observability.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection in Electrical Distribution System using Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, there has been considerable interest in fault detection within electrical power systems, garnering attention from both academic researchers and industry professionals. Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Gradient Networks for Universal Magnetic Modeling of Synchronous Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed neural network approach for dynamic modeling of saturable synchronous machines, including cases with spatial harmonics. We introduce an architecture that incorporates gradient networks directly into the fundamental machine equations, enabling accurate modeling of the nonlinear and coupled electromagnetic constitutive relationship. By learning the gradient of the magnetic field energy, the model inherently satisfies energy balance (reciprocity conditions). The proposed architecture can universally approximate any physically feasible magnetic behavior and offers several advantages over lookup tables and standard machine learning models: it requires less training data, ensures monotonicity and reliable extrapolation, and produces smooth outputs. These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications. We validate the proposed approach using measured and finite-element method (FEM) datasets from a 5.6-kW permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance machine. Results demonstrate accurate and physically consistent models, even with limited training data.</description>

Abstract: We study language-in-the-loop control for multi-drone systems that execute evolving, high-level missions while retaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer. We propose a three-layer architecture in which (i) a human operator issues natural-language instructions, (ii) an LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects the commanded task in the context of the latest state and target estimates, and (iii) a distributed inner-loop controller tracks the resulting reference using only local relative information. We derive a theoretical guarantee that characterizes tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates. Overall, our results illustrate how centralized language-based task reasoning can be combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Periodic Solutions with Applications to Extremum-Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides two results that are useful in the study of the existence and the stability properties of a periodic solution for a given dynamical system. The first result deals with scalar time-periodic systems and establishes the equivalence of the existence of a periodic solution and the existence of a bounded solution. The second result provides sufficient conditions for the existence and the stability of a periodic solution for a time-periodic dynamical system. Both results are applied to extremum seeking problems for a static output map with no plant dynamics and novel non-local results are provided without the use of averaging theorems and singular perturbation arguments.</description>

      <title>SPLIT: Sparse Incremental Learning of Error Dynamics for Control-Oriented Modeling in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, computationally efficient, and adaptive vehicle models are essential for autonomous vehicle control. Hybrid models that combine a nominal model with a Gaussian Process (GP)-based residual model have emerged as a promising approach. However, the GP-based residual model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, high evaluation complexity, and the inefficiency of online learning, which impede the deployment in real-time vehicle controllers. To address these challenges, we propose SPLIT, a sparse incremental learning framework for control-oriented vehicle dynamics modeling. SPLIT integrates three key innovations: (i) Model Decomposition. We decompose the vehicle model into invariant elements calibrated by experiments, and variant elements compensated by the residual model to reduce feature dimensionality. (ii) Local Incremental Learning. We define the valid region in the feature space and partition it into subregions, enabling efficient online learning from streaming data. (iii) GP Sparsification. We use bayesian committee machine to ensure scalable online evaluation. Integrated into model-based controllers, SPLIT is evaluated in aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments. Results demonstrate that SPLIT improves model accuracy and control performance online. Moreover, it enables rapid adaptation to vehicle dynamics deviations and exhibits robust generalization to previously unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>XIT: Exploration and Exploitation Informed Trees for Active Gas Distribution Mapping in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robotic gas distribution mapping (GDM) provides critical situational awareness during emergency responses to hazardous gas releases. However, most systems still rely on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed. Autonomous active GDM is challenging in unknown and cluttered environments, because the robot must simultaneously explore traversable space, map the environment, and infer the gas distribution belief from sparse chemical measurements. We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty. To enable plume-aware exploration, we introduce the gas frontier concept, defined as unobserved regions adjacent to high gas concentrations, and propose the Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for their identification. High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the benefits of XIT in terms of GDM quality and efficiency. Although developed for active GDM, XIT is readily applicable to other robotic information-gathering tasks in unknown environments that face the exploration and exploitation trade-off.</description>

      <title>Rigidity-Based Multi-Finger Coordination for Precise In-Hand Manipulation of Force-Sensitive Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise in-hand manipulation of force-sensitive objects typically requires judicious coordinated force planning as well as accurate contact force feedback and control. Unlike multi-arm platforms with gripper end effectors, multi-fingered hands rely solely on fingertip point contacts and are not able to apply pull forces, therefore poses a more challenging problem. Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory. We validate the framework on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating the capability to manipulate fragile objects-including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg-with high precision and safety.</description>

      <title>Muscle Coactivation in the Sky: Geometry and Pareto Optimality of Energy vs. Promptness in Multirotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robotics and human biomechanics, the tension between energy economy and kinematic readiness is well recognized; this work brings that fundamental principle to aerial multirotors. We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation.</description>

      <title>Path Planning Optimisation for SParse, AwaRe and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Teams (SpArC-NARTs): Optimisation Tool and Ground Sensing Coverage Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A networked aerial robot team (NART) comprises a group of agents (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, etc.) interconnected by wireless links. Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Koopman Linear Embeddings for Controlled Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman linear representations have become a popular tool for control design of nonlinear systems, yet it remains unclear when such representations are exact. In this paper, we establish sufficient and necessary conditions under which a controlled nonlinear system admits an exact finite-dimensional Koopman linear representation, which we term Koopman linear embedding. We show that such a system must be transformable into a special control-affine preserved (CAP) structure, which enforces affine dependence of the state on the control input and isolates all nonlinearities into an autonomous subsystem. We further prove that this autonomous subsystem must itself admit a finite-dimensional Koopman linear model with a sufficiently-rich Koopman invariant subspace. Finally, we introduce a symbolic procedure to determine whether a given controlled nonlinear system admits the CAP structure, thereby elucidating whether Koopman approximation errors arise from intrinsic system dynamics or from the choice of lifting functions.</description>

      <title>Temporally Flexible Transport Scheduling on Networks with Departure-Arrival Constriction and Nodal Capacity Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal transport (OT) problem over networks, wherein supply and demand are conceptualized as temporal marginals governing departure rates of particles from source nodes and arrival rates at sink nodes. This setting extends the classical OT framework, where all mass is conventionally assumed to depart at $t = 0$ and arrive at $t = t_f$. Our generalization accommodates departures and arrivals at specified times, referred as departure--arrival(DA) constraints. In particular, we impose nodal-temporal flux constraints at source and sink nodes, characterizing two distinct scenarios: (i) Independent DA constraints, where departure and arrival rates are prescribed independently, and (ii) Coupled DA constraints, where each particle's transportation time span is explicitly specified. We establish that OT with independent DA constraints admits a multi-marginal optimal transport formulation, while the coupled DA case aligns with the unequal-dimensional OT framework. For line graphs, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution path. For general graphs, we use a constructive path-based reduction and optimize over a prescribed set of paths. From a computational perspective, we consider entropic regularization of the original problem to efficiently provide solutions based on multi-marginal Sinkhorn method, making use of the graphical structure of the cost to further improve scalability. Our numerical simulation further illustrates the linear convergence rate in terms of marginal violation.</description>

      <title>ROSA: Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory with Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in Multimodal Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ROSA -- Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory -- a system that combines multi-agent trajectory prediction with coordinated speed guidance for multimodal, mixed traffic at roundabouts. Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

      <title>On Convergence Analysis of Network-GIANT: An approximate Hessian-based fully distributed optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed convergence analysis of a recently developed approximate Newton-type fully distributed optimization method for smooth, strongly convex local loss functions, called Network-GIANT, which has been empirically illustrated to show faster linear convergence properties while having the same communication complexity (per iteration) as its first order distributed counterparts. By using consensus based parameter updates, and a local Hessian based descent direction at the individual nodes with gradient tracking, we first explicitly characterize a global linear convergence rate for Network-GIANT, which can be computed as the spectral radius of a $3 \times 3$ matrix dependent on the Lipschitz continuity ($L$) and strong convexity ($\mu$) parameters of the objective functions, and the spectral norm ($\sigma$) of the underlying undirected graph represented by a doubly stochastic consensus matrix. We provide an explicit bound on the step size parameter $\eta$, below which this spectral radius is guaranteed to be less than $1$. Furthermore, we derive a mixed linear-quadratic inequality based upper bound for the optimality gap norm, which allows us to conclude that, under small step size values, asymptotically, as the algorithm approaches the global optimum, it achieves a locally linear convergence rate of $1-\eta(1 -\frac{\gamma}{\mu})$ for Network-GIANT, provided the Hessian approximation error $\gamma$ (between the harmonic mean of the local Hessians and the global hessian (the arithmetic mean of the local Hessians) is smaller than $\mu$. This asymptotically linear convergence rate of $\approx 1-\eta$ explains the faster convergence rate of Network-GIANT for the first time. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced CovType dataset for binary logistic regression over a variety of graphs to illustrate the above theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filtering Based Flight Management System Modeling for AAM Aircraft</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) operations require strategic flight planning services that predict both spatial and temporal uncertainties to safely validate flight plans against hazards such as weather cells, restricted airspaces, and CNS disruption areas. Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study randomized experiments in a service system when stochastic congestion can arise from temporarily limited supply or excess demand. Such congestion gives rise to cross-unit interference between the waiting customers, and analytic strategies that do not account for this interference may be biased. In current practice, one of the most widely used ways to address stochastic congestion is to use switchback experiments that alternatively turn a target intervention on and off for the whole system. We find, however, that under a queueing model for stochastic congestion, the standard way of analyzing switchbacks is inefficient, and that estimators that leverage the queueing model can be materially more accurate. Additionally, we show how the queueing model enables estimation of total policy gradients from unit-level randomized experiments, thus giving practitioners an alternative experimental approach they can use without needing to pre-commit to a fixed switchback length before data collection.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Quadrupedal Gaits: A Symmetry-Guided RL Hierarchy Enables Free Gait Transitions at Varying Speeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.</description>

Abstract: Cost-effectiveness analyses, based on decision-analytic models of disease progression and treatment, are routinely used to assess the economic value of a new intervention and consequently inform reimbursement decisions for the intervention. Many decision-analytic models developed to assess the economic value of highly effective directly acting antiviral (DAA) treatments for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection do not incorporate the transmission dynamics of HCV, accounting for which is required to estimate the number of downstream infections prevented by curing an infection. In this study, we develop and validate a comprehensive agent-based simulation (ABS) model of HCV transmission dynamics in the Indian context and use it to: (a) quantify the extent to which the cost-effectiveness of a DAA is underestimated - as a function of its uptake rate - if disease transmission dynamics are not considered in a cost-effectiveness analysis model; and (b) quantify the impact of the frequency and timing of treatment with DAAs, also as a function of their uptake rate, within a disease surveillance period on its cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Predator-Prey Age-Structured Hyperbolic PDE when Harvesting both Species is Inevitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06823</link>

Abstract: Populations do not only interact over time but also age over time. It is therefore common to model them as age-structured PDEs, where age is the space variable. Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth process and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population densities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But non-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one species will inevitably repress the other species as well, the positivity restriction on the input (no insertion of population), and the multiplicative nature of harvesting, makes control challenging even for ODE versions of such dynamics, let alone for their IPDE versions on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state space. We introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a two-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), actuated by harvesting which must not drop below zero, and strongly disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a modified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback which employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE model, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a more sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE model globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE dynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated feedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. The paper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional multi-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive controls.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways</title>

Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. Under simplifying assumptions, we develop statistical models to identify the location and relative magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency depends on ER coil spacing and average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the EV count. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the EV count. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. The spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth with the harmonic index. The load of a single EV moving at a time-varying speed can be modeled as a frequency-modulated (FM) signal. Despite the simplifying assumptions, the derived models offer valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Dynamic simulations of a modified WECC model with DWPT loads synthesized from realistic EV trajectories and ER specifications corroborate some of these insights.</description>

      <title>Large-Signal Stability Guarantees for a DC Microgrid with Nested Nonlinear Distributed Control: The Slow Communication Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Accordingly, this paper investigates large-signal stability guarantees for cyber-physical DC microgrids employing a nonlinear distributed consensus-based control scheme to enable coordinated integration and management of distributed generation units within an expandable framework. The proposed control framework adopts nested control loops; inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed), specifically designed to simultaneously achieve uniform voltage containment within pre-specified limits, and proportional current sharing in steady state. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov arguments to prove global exponential stability when imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops, while relying on some practical parameter-setting schemes. The effectiveness and versatility of the proposed control strategy are then validated through time-domain simulations performed on a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid and the modified IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system. Moreover, a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>PAC One-Step Safety Certification for Black-Box Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of safety certification for black-box discrete-time stochastic systems, where both the system dynamics and disturbance distributions are unknown, and only sampled data are available. Under such limited information, ensuring robust or classical quantitative safety over finite or infinite horizons is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that provides theoretical one-step safety guarantees in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sense. This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.</description>

      <title>String-Level Ground Fault Localization for TN-Earthed Three-Phase Photovoltaic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DC-side ground fault (GF) poses significant risks to three-phase TN-earthed photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the resulting high fault current can directly damage both PV inverters and PV modules. Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Solution to Infinite Horizon Nonholonomic and Discounted Nonlinear Control Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the infinite horizon optimal control problem for nonlinear systems. Under the condition of nonlinear controllability of the system to any terminal set containing the origin and forward invariance of the terminal set, we establish a regularized solution approach consisting of a ``finite free final time" optimal transfer problem to the terminal set, which renders the set globally asymptotically stable. Further, we show that the approximations converge to the optimal infinite horizon cost as the size of the terminal set decreases to zero. We also perform the analysis for the discounted problem and show that the terminal set is asymptotically stable only for a subset of the state space and not globally. The theory is empirically evaluated on various nonholonomic robotic systems to show that the cost of our approximate problem converges and the transfer time into the terminal set is dependent on the initial state of the system, necessitating the free final time formulation. We also do comparisons of our free-final time approach with nonlinear MPC.</description>

Abstract: This work considers infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear systems applied to the case of network routing problems. We demonstrate the equivalence between Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems and optimal control of a certain class of linear systems. This is used to construct a heuristic search framework for linear {positive} systems inspired by existing methods for SSP. {We propose a heuristics-based algorithm for {efficiently} finding local solutions to the analyzed class of optimal control problems with {a given initial} state and {positive} linear dynamics.} {By leveraging the bound on optimality in each state provided by the heuristics, we also derive a novel distributed algorithm for calculating local controllers within a specified performance bound, with a distributed condition for termination.} More fundamentally, the results allow for analysis of the conditions for explicit solutions to the Bellman equation utilized by heuristic search methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to optimal control problems are rarely obtainable. Of particular interest are the explicit solutions derived for minimax problems, providing a framework to address adversarial conditions and uncertainty. This work considers a multi-disturbance minimax Linear Regulator (LR) framework for positive linear time-invariant systems in continuous time, which, analogous to the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem, can be utilized for the stabilization of positive systems. The problem is studied for nonnegative and state-bounded disturbances. Dynamic programming theory is leveraged to derive explicit solutions to the minimax LR problem for both finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, a fixed-point method is proposed that computes the solution for the infinite horizon case, and the minimum L1-induced gain of the system is studied. We motivate the prospective scalability properties of our framework with a large-scale water management network.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics for Deep-space Habitats Exhibiting Multiple Unlabeled Failure Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep-space habitats are complex systems that must operate autonomously over extended durations without ground-based maintenance. These systems are vulnerable to multiple, often unknown, failure modes that affect different subsystems and sensors in mode-specific ways. Developing accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics is challenging, especially when failure labels are unavailable and sensor relevance varies by failure mode. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prognostics framework that jointly identifies latent failure modes and selects informative sensors using only unlabeled training data. The methodology consists of two phases. In the offline phase, we model system failure times using a mixture of Gaussian regressions and apply an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cluster degradation trajectories and select mode-specific sensors. In the online phase, we extract low-dimensional features from the selected sensors to diagnose the active failure mode and predict RUL using a weighted regression model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated dataset that reflects deep-space telemetry characteristics and on a real-world engine degradation dataset, showing improved accuracy and interpretability over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Zono-Conformal Prediction: Zonotope-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Regression and Classification Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor to return sets of predictions with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for safety assessment of learning-enabled stochastic systems. In many robotic applications, the dynamics are inherently stochastic due to factors such as sensing noise and environmental disturbances, and it is challenging for conventional methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to provide a well-calibrated safety critic that is tied to the actual safety probability. We derive a linear operator that governs the dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its dominant eigenpair provides critical safety information for both individual state-action pairs and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed framework learns this dominant eigenpair, which can be used to either inform or constrain policy updates. We demonstrate that the learned eigenpair effectively facilitates safe reinforcement learning. Further, we validate its applicability in enhancing the safety of learned policies from imitation learning through robot manipulation experiments using a UR3 robotic arm in a food preparation task.</description>

The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.2% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description>
