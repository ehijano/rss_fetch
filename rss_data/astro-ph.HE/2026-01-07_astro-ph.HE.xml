      <title>Magnetic reconnection with a 0.1 rate: Effective resistivity in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is thought to power various multi-wavelength emission signatures from neutron stars and black holes. Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) offers the simplest model of reconnection. However, a small uniform resistivity underestimates the reconnection rate compared to first-principles kinetic models. By employing an effective resistivity based on kinetic models - which connects the reconnection electric field to the charge-starved current density - we show that RRMHD can reproduce the increased reconnection rate of kinetic models, both in local current sheets and in global black hole magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in neutron star mergers with moment transport: slow, fast, and collisional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining where, when, and how neutrino flavor oscillations must be included in large-scale simulations of hot and dense astrophysical environments is an enduring challenge that must be tackled to obtain accurate predictions. Using an angular moment-based linear stability analysis framework, we examine the different kinds of flavor instabilities that can take place in the context of the post-processing of a neutron star merger simulation, with a particular focus on the collisional flavor instability and a careful assessment of several commonly used approximations. First, neglecting anisotropies of the neutrino field, we investigate the extent to which commonly used monoenergetic growth rates reproduce the results obtained from a full multi-energy treatment. Contrary to the large discrepancies found in core-collapse supernova environments, we propose a simple combination of energy-averaged estimates that reproduces the multi-energy growth rates in our representative simulation snapshot. We then quantify the impact of additional physical effects, including nuclear many-body corrections, scattering opacities, and the inclusion of the vacuum term in the neutrino Hamiltonian. Finally, we include the neutrino distribution anisotropies, which allows us to explore, for the first time in a multi-energy setting, the interplay between collisional, fast, and slow modes in a moment-based neutron star merger simulation. We find that despite a dominance of the fast instability in most of the simulation volume, certain regions only exhibit a collisional instability, while others, especially at large distances, exhibit a slow instability that is largely underestimated if anisotropic effects are neglected.</description>

      <title>On the exceptionality of exceptional gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, as in other scientific disciplines, ``exceptional'' sources attract considerable interest because they challenge our current understanding of the underlying (astro)physical processes. Crucially, ``exceptionality'' is defined only relative to the rest of the detected population. For instance, among all gravitational-wave events detected so far, GW231123 is the binary black hole with the largest total mass, while GW241110 is the binary black hole with the most strongly misaligned spin relative to the orbital angular momentum. Mandel [Astrophys.J.Lett. 996 (2026) 1, L4] argued that apparent ``exceptionality'' may reflect measurement error rather than an extreme true value, and suggested that the total mass of GW231123 may be significantly overestimated. Here we present a quantitative analysis that supports this conceptual point. We find that claims of ``exceptionality'' obtained under agnostic priors should be critically questioned whenever measurement uncertainties are comparable to the width of the underlying population. Specifically, we find that the total mass of GW231123 is unlikely to be meaningfully affected by this effect while the spin of GW241110 is far less likely to be anti-aligned than initially claimed: about 70% of realizations that appear to yield an ``exceptionally anti-aligned'' spin are in fact consistent with either nonspinning or aligned configurations.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Gravity Model for partial Tidal Disruption Events: Mass Loss, Peak Fallback Rate and Dependence on Stellar Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star entering the tidal sphere of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be partially stripped of mass, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we develop an analytical model for properties of these events, including the peak fallback rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$, the time at which the peak occurs, $t_{\rm peak}$, and the amount of mass removed from the star, $\Delta M$, for any star and any pericenter distance associated with the stellar orbit about the black hole. We compare the model predictions to 1276 hydrodynamical simulations of partial TDEs of main-sequence stars by a $10^6 M_\odot$ SMBH. The model yields $t_{\rm peak}$ predictions that are in good agreement (to within tens of percent) with the numerical simulations for any stellar mass and age. The agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is weaker due to the influence of self-gravity on the debris stream dynamics, which remains dynamically important for partial TDEs; the agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is, however, to within a factor of $\sim 2-3$ in the majority of cases considered, with larger differences for low-mass stars ($M_\star \lesssim 0.5 M_\odot$) on grazing orbits with small mass loss. We show that partial TDE lightcurves for disruptions caused by $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ SMBHs can span $\sim 20-100$ day peak timescales, whereas grazing encounters of high-mass stars with high-mass SMBHs can yield longer peak timescales ($t\gtrsim 1000$ days), associated with some observed transients. Our model provides a significant step toward an analytical prescription for TDE lightcurves and luminosity functions.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Fe K$\alpha$ Doublet of the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud G0.11-0.11 with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe K$\alpha$ line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds can be produced either via fluorescence after illumination by an X-ray source or by cosmic ray ionization. Unparalleled high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy obtained by XRISM-Resolve for the galactic center molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 resolves its Fe K$\alpha$ line complex for the first time, and points to a new method for discrimination between the X-ray reflection and cosmic ray ionization models. The Fe K$\alpha$ line complex is resolved into Fe K$\alpha_1$ at $E_{1} = 6.4040 \: \rm{keV}$ and Fe K$\alpha_2$ at $E_{2}= 6.3910 \:\rm{keV}$. Both lines have non-instrumental FWHM of $\approx 3 \:\rm{eV}$, close to the predicted quantum mechanical width of the lines, suggesting scant other sources of line broadening other than instrumental and quantum effects. We measure a radial velocity of $v_{\rm{LSR}} = 50 \pm 12_{fit} \pm 14_{scale} \:\rm{km/s}$ for G0.11-0.11, achieving the same precision reached by radio observations of such clouds. The high-resolution spectrum tests for the presence of secondary Fe K$\alpha$ lines, expected as a signature of cosmic ray proton/ion ionization. The absence of the secondary lines argues against the cosmic ray ionization model for G0.11-0.11. In the preferred X-ray reflection model, if the illuminating source is Sgr A$^{\star}$, the required luminosity for an X-ray outburst about 200 years ago is $L_8 \approx 10^{38} \:\rm{erg/s}$ in an $8\:\rm{keV}$-wide band at $8\:\rm{keV}$.</description>

      <title>Thick Disks, Thin Hopes: Suppressed Capture and Merger Rates in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple models have been suggested over the years to explain the structure and support of accretion disks around supermassive black holes, from the standard thin thermal-pressure-dominated $\alpha$-disk model to more recent models that describe geometrically thicker radiation or magnetic or turbulence-dominated disks. In any case, objects embedded in the disk (e.g. compact objects, stars, gas, dust) can undergo gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions with each other leading to interesting processes such as binary interaction/capture, gravitational wave merger events, dynamical friction, accretion, gap opening, etc. It has long been argued that disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can enhance the rates for many of these events; however, almost all of that analysis has assumed specific thin-disk models (with aspect ratios $H/R \lesssim 0.01$). We show here that the rates for processes such as these that are mediated by gravitational cross-sections has a very strong inverse dependence on the thickness $H/R$ (scaling as steeply as $(H/R)^{-8}$), and $H/R$ can vary in the outer disk (where these processes are often invoked) by factors $\gtrsim 1000$ depending on the assumed source of pressure support in the disk. This predicts rates that can be lower by tens of orders-of-magnitude in some models, demonstrating that it is critical to account for disk parameters such as aspect ratio and different sources of disk pressure when computing any meaningful predictions for these rates. For instance, if magnetic pressure is important in the outer disk, as suggested in recent work, capture rates would be suppressed by factors $\sim 10^{10}-10^{20}$ compared to previous studies where magnetic pressure was ignored.</description>

      <title>Exploring Composition Mixing in Kilonova Ejecta with Ray-by-ray Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star merger (BNSM) ejecta are considered a primary repository of $r$-process nucleosynthesis and a source of the observed heavy-element abundances. We implement composition mixing into ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of BNSM ejecta, coupled with an online nuclear network (NN). We model mixing via a gradient-based mixing approximation that evolves simultaneously with the hydrodynamics. We find that mixing occurs in regions where the electron fraction changes rapidly. While mixing smooths composition gradients in transition regions, it has a negligible impact on the heavy-element yields. This is because the primary $r$-process site (the equatorial ejecta) is initially homogeneous in free neutrons, leaving no strong gradients for mixing to act upon. In each angular ray, the abundances of the most produced elements are robust under mixing, while the less abundant ones are more affected. The total global abundances change only slightly from mixing, since each angular ray contributes its most abundant elements. Furthermore, the predicted kilonova light curves show only minor reddening, with differences below the detectability of state-of-the-art telescopes. In general, we do not observe significant effects from mixing in the time span of the $r$-process. Consequently, mixing only leads to minor variations in abundances and light curves in ray-by-ray simulations.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfl: A Flat-Plateau, Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernova with Early CSM Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova (LLSN) discovered shortly after explosion. The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V = -14.9$ and exhibited an extended, flat plateau lasting $\sim$125 days. From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim0.01~M_\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission. The spectroscopic evolution is typical of LLSNe, with relatively narrow metal lines and low expansion velocities ($\lesssim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) that decline slowly over time. We detect a broad ``ledge'' feature around 4600 \AA within three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$\alpha$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions. As one of the best-observed examples of LLSNe, SN 2024abfl exhibits a weak explosion and signatures of nearby CSM, offering new insights into progenitor properties, pre-explosion mass loss, and the diversity of LLSNe.</description>

      <title>Super-Orbital Variations in Magnetar Rotation Measure Arising from the Precession of Companion Star: Implications for FRB 20220529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of FRB 20220529 reveal significant variation and a partial reversal in its rotation measure (RM), suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving magnetized environment, which could be caused by the orbital motion of the magnetar within the binary system. Here we develop the binary model by suggesting that the spin and magnetic axis of the companion star could undergo precession around the orbital axis. It is then investigated how the precession period and the inclination of the magnetic axis, as well as a possible disc wind, can influence the evolution behaviors of the RM and dispersion measure (DM) of FRB emission. As the foremost consequence, the RM variation can be significantly altered on timescales longer than the orbital period, producing super-orbital evolution and complex patterns. Applying this model to FRB 20220529, we find that its RM evolution could be reproduced with a precession period of 182 days and an inclination angle of approximately $19^{\circ}$, while the other binary parameters are fixed at their typical values. Meanwhile, the absence of significant variation of the DM argues against the presence of a dense equatorial disc around the companion star, which would be constrained by future long-term observations.</description>

      <title>Transient Large-Scale Anisotropy in TeV Cosmic Rays due to an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large- or medium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy at TeV energies has not previously been confirmed to vary with time. Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $&gt;$5$\sigma$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order. This new type of observation opens the opportunity to study interplanetary magnetic structures using air shower arrays around the world, complementing existing in situ and remote measurements of plasma properties.</description>

      <title>Large-scale radio bubbles around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) in microquasars can launch powerful relativistic jets that have the capacity to travel up to several parsecs from the compact object and interact with the interstellar medium. Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.</description>

      <title>Predictability of bursts of a recurrent nova using topological data analysis and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RS Oph is a recurrent nova, a kind of cataclismic variable that shows bursts in a period approximately shorter than a century. Persistent homology, a technique from topological data analysis, studies the evolution of topological features of a simplicial complex composed of the data points or an embedding of them, as some distance parameter is varied. For this work I trained a supervised learning model based on several featurizations, namely persistence landscapes, Carlsson coordinates, persistent images, and template functions, of the persistence diagrams of sections of the lightcurve of RS Oph. A tenfold cross validation of the model based on one of the featurizations, persistence landscapes, consistently shows high recalls and accuracies. This method serves the purpose of predicting whether RS Oph is bursting within a year.</description>

      <title>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</description>

      <title>Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to $z\sim14$, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at $z\sim15-25$, with one candidate as high as $z\sim30$, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Lazuli Space Observatory: Architecture &amp; Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35' $\times$ 12' footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli's technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</description>

      <title>SpaceWire-based Data Acquisition Network for the Solar Flare Sounding Rocket Experiment FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6\sigma$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</description>

      <title>A Universal Upper Bound on the Pressure-to-Energy Density Ratio in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $\phi \equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv \phi_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of an extended very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source around the location of the middle-aged (207.8 kyr) pulsar PSR J0622+3749 with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The source is detected with a significance of $8.2\sigma$ for $E&gt;25$~TeV assuming a Gaussian template. The best-fit location is (R.A., Dec.)$=(95^{\circ}\!.47\pm0^{\circ}\!.11,\,37^{\circ}\!.92 \pm0^{\circ}\!.09)$, and the extension is $0^{\circ}\!.40\pm0^{\circ}\!.07$. The energy spectrum can be described by a power-law spectrum with an index of ${-2.92 \pm 0.17_{\rm stat} \pm 0.02_{\rm sys} }$. No clear extended multi-wavelength counterpart of the LHAASO source has been found from the radio to sub-TeV bands. The LHAASO observations are consistent with the scenario that VHE electrons escaped from the pulsar, diffused in the interstellar medium, and scattered the interstellar radiation field. If interpreted as the pulsar halo scenario, the diffusion coefficient, inferred for electrons with median energies of $\sim160$~TeV, is consistent with those obtained from the extended halos around Geminga and Monogem and much smaller than that derived from cosmic ray secondaries. The LHAASO discovery of this source thus likely enriches the class of so-called pulsar halos and confirms that high-energy particles generally diffuse very slowly in the disturbed medium around pulsars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Ultra-high energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108+5157</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a UHE gamma-ray source, LHAASO J2108+5157, by analyzing the LHAASO-KM2A data of 308.33 live days. Significant excess of gamma-ray induced showers is observed in both energy bands of 25-100 TeV and $\gt$100 TeV with 9.5 sigma and 8.5 sigma, respectively. This source is not significantly favored as an extensive source with the angular extension smaller than the point-spread function of KM2A. The measured energy spectrum from 20 to 200 TeV can be approximately described by a power-law function with an index of -2.83$\pm$ 0.18stat. A harder spectrum is demanded at lower energies considering the flux upper limit set by Fermi-LAT observations. The position of the gamma-ray emission is correlated with a giant molecular cloud, which favors a hadronic origin. No obvious counterparts have been found, deeper multiwavelength observations will help to shed new light on this intriguing UHE source.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new $\gamma$-ray source LHAASO J0341+5258 with emission up to 200TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new unidentified extended $\gamma$-ray source in the Galactic plane named LHAASO J0341+5258 with a pre-trial significance of 8.2 standard deviations above 25 TeV. The best fit position is R.A.$=55.34^{\circ}\pm0.11^{\circ}$ and Dec$=52.97^{\circ}\pm0.07^{\circ}$. The angular size of LHAASO J0341+5258 is $0.29^\circ \pm 0.06^\circ_{stat} \pm0.02^\circ_{sys}$. The flux above 25 TeV is about $20\%$ of the flux of Crab Nebula. Although a power-law fit of the spectrum from 10 TeV to 200 TeV with the photon index $\alpha=2.98 \pm 0.19_{stat} \pm 0.02_{sys}$ is not excluded, the LHAASO data together with the flux upper limit at 10 GeV set by the Fermi LAT observation, indicate a noticeable steepening of an initially hard power-law spectrum %($\alpha \leq 1.75$) spectrum with a cutoff at $\approx 50$ TeV. We briefly discuss the origin of UHE gamma-rays. The lack of an energetic pulsar and a young SNR inside or in the vicinity of LHAASO J0341+5258 challenge, but do not exclude both the leptonic and hadronic scenarios of gamma-ray production.</description>

      <title>Constraints on heavy decaying dark matter from 570 days of LHAASO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kilometer Square Array~(KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) aims at surveying the northern gamma-ray sky at energies above 10 TeV with unprecedented sensitivity. Gamma-ray observations have long been one of the most powerful tools for dark matter searches, as e.g., high-energy gamma-rays could be produced by the decays of heavy dark matter particles. In this letter, we present the first dark matter analysis with LHAASO-KM2A, using the first 340~days of data from 1/2-KM2A and 230~days of data from 3/4-KM2A. Several regions of interest are used to search for a signal and account for the residual cosmic-ray background after gamma/hadron separation. We find no excess of dark matter signals, and thus place some of the strongest gamma-ray constraints on the lifetime of heavy dark matter particles with mass between 10^5 and 10^9~GeV. Our results with LHAASO are robust, and have important implications for dark matter interpretations of the diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>An Ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray Bubble Powered by a Super PeVatron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a $\gamma$-ray bubble spanning at least 100$\rm deg^2$ in ultra high energy (UHE) up to a few PeV in the direction of the star-forming region Cygnus X, implying the presence Super PeVatron(s) accelerating protons to at least 10 PeV. A log-parabola form with the photon index $\Gamma (E) = (2.71 \pm 0.02) + (0.11 \pm 0.02) \times \log_{10} (E/10 \ {\rm TeV})$ is found fitting the gamma-ray energy spectrum of the bubble well. UHE sources, `hot spots' correlated with very massive molecular clouds, and a quasi-spherical amorphous $\gamma$-ray emitter with a sharp central brightening are observed in the bubble. In the core of $\sim 0.5^{\circ}$, spatially associating with a region containing massive OB association (Cygnus OB2) and a microquasar (Cygnus X-3), as well as previously reported multi-TeV sources, an enhanced concentration of UHE $\gamma$-rays are observed with 2 photons at energies above 1 PeV. The general feature of the bubble, the morphology and the energy spectrum, are reasonably reproduced by the assumption of a particle accelerator in the core, continuously injecting protons into the ambient medium.</description>

      <title>Evidence for particle acceleration approaching PeV energies in the W51 complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the ``$\pi^0$-decay bump" featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$~TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$~TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO. Our findings strongly support the presence of extreme CR accelerators within the W51 complex and provide new insights into the origin of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>Deep view of Composite SNR CTA1 with LHAASO in $\gamma$-rays up to 300 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J0007+7303u is positionally associated with the composite SNR CTA1 that is located at high Galactic Latitude $b\approx 10.5^\circ$. This provides a rare opportunity to spatially resolve the component of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and supernova remnant (SNR) at UHE. This paper conducted a dedicated data analysis of 1LHAASO J0007+7303u using the data collected from December 2019 to July 2023. This source is well detected with significances of 21$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ at 8$-$100 TeV and $&gt;$100 TeV, respectively. The corresponding extensions are determined to be 0.23$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$ and 0.17$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$. The emission is proposed to originate from the relativistic electrons and positrons accelerated within the PWN of PSR J0007+7303. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff function $dN/dE = (42.4\pm4.1)(\frac{E}{20\rm\ TeV})^{-2.31\pm0.11}\exp(-\frac{E}{110\pm25\rm\ TeV})$ $\rm\ TeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$in the energy range from 8 TeV to 300 TeV, implying a steady-state parent electron spectrum $dN_e/dE_e\propto (\frac{E_e}{100\rm\ TeV})^{-3.13\pm0.16}\exp[(\frac{-E_e}{373\pm70\rm\ TeV})^2]$ at energies above $\approx 50 \rm\ TeV$. The cutoff energy of the electron spectrum is roughly equal to the expected current maximum energy of particles accelerated at the PWN terminal shock. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray emission, the current space-averaged magnetic field can be limited to $\approx 4.5\rm\ \mu G$. To satisfy the multi-wavelength spectrum and the $\gamma$-ray extensions, the transport of relativistic particles within the PWN is likely dominated by the advection process under the free-expansion phase assumption.</description>

      <title>An Enigmatic PeVatron in an Area around HII Region G35.6$-$0.5</title>

Abstract: Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from the ultra-high-energy (UHE, &gt;100 TeV) $\gamma$-ray sources plays a crucial role in revealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The UHE source 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be attributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G35.6$-$0.4 or HII region G35.6$-$0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the very-high-energy and UHE $\gamma$-ray emissions towards this region with data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6$\sigma$ above 100 TeV, indicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extension of $\sim 0.18^\circ$ with a power-law (PL) spectral index of $\sim$2.5 in 1-25 TeV and a point-like emission with a PL spectral index of $\sim$3.2 above 25 TeV. Using the archival CO and HI data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be associated with the TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our modelling indicates that the TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from the clouds illuminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6$-$0.4. In the scenario that HII region G35.6$-$0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the observed GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic model with a PL spectral index of $\sim$2.0 and cutoff energy of $\sim$450 TeV. However, an evolved pulsar wind nebula origin cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Cosmic-ray Energy Based on Observations of Nearby Galaxy Clusters by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters act as reservoirs of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs). As CRs propagate through the intracluster medium, they generate diffuse $\gamma$-rays detectable by arrays such as LHAASO. These $\gamma$-rays result from proton-proton ($pp$) collisions of very high-energy cosmic rays (VHECRs) or inverse Compton (IC) scattering of positron-electron pairs created by $p\gamma$ interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We analyzed diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from the Coma, Perseus, and Virgo clusters using LHAASO data. Diffuse emission was modeled as a disk of radius $R_{500}$ for each cluster while accounting for point sources. No significant diffuse emission was detected, yielding 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray flux: for WCDA (1-25~TeV) and KM2A ($&gt;25$~TeV), less than $(49.4, 13.7, 54.0)$ and $(1.34, 1.14, 0.40) \times 10^{-14}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ for Coma, Perseus, and Virgo, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray upper limits can be used to derive model-independent constraints on the integral energy of CRp above 10~TeV (corresponding to the LHAASO observational range $&gt;1$~TeV under the $pp$ scenario) to be less than $(1.96, 0.59, 0.08) \times 10^{61}$~erg. The absence of detectable annuli/ring-like structures, indicative of cluster accretion or merging shocks, imposes further constraints on models in which the UHECRs are accelerated in the merging shocks of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Unifying Circumstellar Environment in Broad-Lined Type Ic Radio Supernovae Towards Off-axis Gamma-Ray Burst Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades have passed since the first confirmed association between a broad-lined Type Ic supernova (Type IcBL SN) and a long gamma-ray burst (GRB), and the number of known GRB-SN associations has steadily increased. However, it is important to note that the radiation from GRB afterglows and the radio emission from SNe may be both produced by outflows evolving within the same ambient medium. In this study, we present the first comprehensive theoretical predictions of radio emission from a Type IcBL supernova associated with a GRB jet, explicitly accounting for the structure of the ambient medium. We model each component of the radio emission, with particular emphasis on exploring wide ranges of isotropic explosion energy and viewing angle in our GRB afterglow calculations. We show that, within specific regions of parameter space, the composite radio light curve exhibits a characteristic double-peaked structure. This clear double-peaked feature emerges when either (1) the isotropic explosion energy is small (low-luminosity GRB) or (2) the viewing angle is large (off-axis GRB). Our results demonstrate that follow-up radio observations carried out within a few years of the optical discovery of nearby Type IcBL SNe (-100 Mpc) can provide a unique diagnostic of off-axis GRBs that would otherwise remain undetected in Type IcBL SNe. This represents a step toward revealing the nature of long GRB progenitors and clarifying their connection to Type IcBL SNe.</description>

      <title>The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) Community Science Book</title>

Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles 138 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <title>LHAASO Detection of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission toward the Giant Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray from Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is regarded as the most ideal tool to perform in-situ measurement of cosmic ray (CR) density and spectra in our Galaxy. We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emissions in the very-high-energy (VHE) domain from the five nearby GMCs with a stacking analysis based on a 4.5-year $\gamma$-ray observation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment. The spectral energy distributions derived from the GMCs are consistent with the expected $\gamma$-ray flux produced via CR interacting with the ISM in the energy interval 1 - 100 $~\rm$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the presence of the CR spectral `knee' by introducing a spectral break in the $\gamma$-ray data. While no significant evidence for the CR knee is found, the current KM2A measurements from GMCs strongly favor a proton CR knee located above 0.9$~\rm$ PeV, which is consistent with the latest measurement of the CR spectrum by ground-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary. The $\gamma$-ray signal was detected with a statistical significance of approximately 10 $\sigma$ by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Its intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), extending from 0.06 to 3.7 PeV, shows a pronounced rise toward 1 PeV after accounting for absorption by the cosmic microwave background radiation. The detected month-scale variability,together with a 3.2$\sigma$ evidence for orbital modulation, suggests that the PeV $\gamma$-rays originate within, or in close proximity to, the binary system itself. The observed energy spectrum and temporal modulation can be naturally explained by $\gamma$-ray production through photomeson processes in the innermost region of the relativistic jet, where protons need to be accelerated to tens of PeV energies.</description>

      <title>Energy-Dependent Shifts of Medium-Scale Anisotropies in Very-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Observed by LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small deviations from isotropy in the arrival directions of Galactic cosmic rays serve as a unique probe of the local magnetic environment. In this Letter, we report observations of medium-scale anisotropies (MSA) at energies above 10 TeV using the LHAASO-KM2A array. Our analysis identifies four regions of excess and four regions of deficit, each spanning angular scales of approximately ten degrees. Crucially, we detect significant energy-dependent shifts in the centroids of two excess regions: Region B and the newly identified Region $\mathrm{\widetilde{D}}$. We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions. These findings imply that the observed anisotropies are shaped by the specific realization of the local turbulent magnetic field within the cosmic ray scattering length. Such energy-dependent behaviors impose strict constraints on local turbulence models and cosmic ray propagation theories.</description>

      <title>Decoding Cygnus X-2: The Critical Role of Reflection in IXPE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectro-polarimetric re-analysis of the first IXPE observation of Cygnus X-2 which we determine to be mainly in the normal branch, from quasi-simultaneous observations with NuSTAR, NICER, and INTEGRAL. We measure the hard X-ray polarization angle and find it to be consistent with the previously measured position angle of the radio jet. Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE. We also discuss the disk inclination angle inferred from our spectro-polarimetric modeling, as well as other possible explanations for the data.</description>

      <title>Measurement of attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers provides important information regarding the generation and development of air showers. This information can be used not only to improve the description of such showers but also to test fundamental models of hadronic interactions. Using data from the LHAASO-KM2A experiment, the development of the muon content in high-energy air showers was studied. The attenuation length of muon content in the air showers was measured from experimental data in the energy range from 0.3 to 30 PeV using the constant intensity cut method. By comparing the attenuation length of the muon content with predictions from high-energy hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, and EPOS-LHC), it is evident that LHAASO results are significantly shorter than those predicted by the first two models (QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d) but relatively close to those predicted by the third model (EPOS-LHC). Thus, the LHAASO data favor the EPOS-LHC model over the other two models. The three interaction models confirmed an increasing trend in the attenuation length as the cosmic-ray energy increases.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>

Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Observable Signatures of a Quarkyonic Phase in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models for neutron star matter, we find they satisfy all current astrophysical observations, thus reinforcing the argument for the use of such neutron star matter equation-of-state models alongside traditional ones. To observationally differentiate between stars with and without a quarkyonic phase, we identify a novel observational signature- the slope of the mass-radius relation at some fixed mass in conjunction with the sound speed at the star's center. In this plane, we find quarkyonic stars in a region with high central sound speed and positive slope, that is distinct from purely nucleonic stars. High accuracy NS radii measurements facilitated by the next generation of detectors, coupled with ongoing studies of mapping astrophysical observables to microphysical properties like sound speed can be used for testing this signature. Our results indicate that a neutron star with these properties would be a strong evidence for existence of a quarkyonic phase or a similar crossover transition in its core.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Delayed Wind Onset in Pa 30, the Remnant of Type Iax SN 1181</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pa 30 is the recently identified remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181, likely a Type Iax event, and a nebula surrounding the central white dwarf launching a fast wind ($\sim10^9~\cm~\s^{-1}$) is observed in optical and infrared bands. X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa~30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Driven Corrugation of Collisionless Fast-Magnetosonic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>
