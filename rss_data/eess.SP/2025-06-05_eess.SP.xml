      <title>Experience Paper: Scaling WiFi Sensing to Millions of Commodity Devices for Ubiquitous Home Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>DAS-MAE: A self-supervised pre-training framework for universal and high-performance representation learning of distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals' representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations (e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5% relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application, DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Maximization for mmWave MIMO-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Practical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs), while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference (MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under consideration.</description>

      <title>Design of OTFS Signals with Pulse Shaping and Window Function for OTFS-Based Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pulse radar system that employs a generalized window function derived from the root raised cosine (RRC), which relaxes the conventional constraint that the window values are within the range [0, 1]. The proposed window allows both negative values and values exceeding 1, enabling greater flexibility in signal design. The system transmits orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signals intermittently, establishing a flexible input-output relationship that captures both fractional delays and Doppler shifts. By combining the generalized RRC window with a rectangular pulse, the resulting pilot signal achieves a sharp concentration in the ambiguity function over both the delay and Doppler domains. To enhance the estimation accuracy of fractional parameters, we apply frequency-domain interpolation based on the autocorrelation of the RRC window, which outperforms conventional linear interpolation by preserving the signal structure more effectively.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO with 1-Bit DACs: Data Detection for Quantized Linear Precoding with Dithering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft estimation.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna Systems versus Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in mmWave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible and intelligent antenna designs, such as pinching antenna systems and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), have gained extensive research attention due to their potential to enhance the wireless channels. This letter, for the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching antenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal that RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of $10^4$) to outperform pinching antenna systems in terms of spectral efficiency, which severely impact the energy efficiency performance of RIS. Moreover, pinching antenna systems demonstrate greater robustness against hardware impairments and severe path loss typically encountered in high-frequency mmWave bands.</description>

      <title>An SCMA Receiver for 6G NTN based on Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to enhance the user experience in a multitude of different ways. The unification of existing terrestrial networks with non-terrestrial network (NTN) components will provide users with ubiquitous connectivity. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) will enable low-latency services, with computations performed closer to the end users, and distributed learning paradigms. Advanced multiple access schemes, such as sparse code multiple access (SCMA), can be employed to efficiently move data from edge nodes to spaceborne MEC servers. However, the non-orthogonal nature of SCMA results in interference, limiting the effectiveness of traditional SCMA receivers. Hence, NTN links should be protected with robust channel codes, significantly reducing the uplink throughput. Thus, we investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to SCMA receivers for 6G NTNs. We train an AI model with multi-task learning to optimally separate and receive superimposed SCMA signals. Through link level simulations, we evaluate the block error rate (BLER) and the aggregated theoretical throughput achieved by the AI model as a function of the received energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio (Eb/N0). We show that the proposed receiver achieves a target 10% BLER with 3.5dB lower Eb/N0 with respect to the benchmark algorithm. We conclude the assessment discussing the complexity-related challenges to the implementation of the AI model on board of a low earth orbit satellite.</description>

      <title>Noise-Driven AI Sensors: Secure Healthcare Monitoring with PUFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating noise-driven signal processing, PUFbased authentication, and ML-based anomaly detection, our system achieves secure, low-power monitoring for devices like ECG wearables. Simulations demonstrate that noise improves ML accuracy by 8% (92% for detecting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial fibrillation (AF)), while PUFs provide 98% uniqueness for tamper-resistant security, all within a 50 uW power budget. This unified approach not only addresses power, security, and noise challenges but also enables scalable, intelligent sensing for telemedicine and IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Integer User Association using a GNN with Gumbel-Softmax Reparameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can effectively optimize a multi-cell wireless network by designing the beamforming vectors and association decisions. Existing ML designs, however, often needs to approximate the integer association variables with a probability distribution output. We propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) structure that jointly optimize beamforming vectors and user association while guaranteeing association output as integers. The integer association constraints are satisfied using the Gumbel-Softmax (GS) reparameterization, without increasing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GS-based GNN consistently achieves integer association decisions and yields a higher sum-rate, especially when generalized to larger networks, compared to all other fractional association methods.</description>

      <title>Polarized 6D Movable Antenna for Wireless Communication: Channel Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna (P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively. Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First, we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI. Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming, antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.</description>

Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.</description>

      <title>MARS: Radio Map Super-resolution and Reconstruction Method under Sparse Channel Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.</description>

      <title>An Array Decomposition Method for Finite Arrays with Electrically Connected Elements for fast Toeplitz Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method, applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32 array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.</description>

      <title>Synchro-Thermography: Monitoring ~10 mK Facial Temperature Changes with Heartbeat Referencing for Physiological Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity. Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Semantic Resource Allocation with Cumulative Prospect Theoretic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective (e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory (EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics. By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization for Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation under CPT-based Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here. By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Indoor Sharing in the Mid-Band: A Performance Study of Neutral-Host, Cellular Macro, and Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs), suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand, may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models, particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private 4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6 GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6 network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices (CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink (UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv) the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL performance by 5.05x.</description>

      <title>Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Recognition WITHOUT Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Through-the-Wall-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Without-Using-Neural-Networks.</description>

      <title>CSI2Vec: Towards a Universal CSI Feature Representation for Positioning and Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec, a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC performance while reducing computational demands and storage.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning for Biosignal Applications -- A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has gained traction in an attempt to improve the interpretability and robustness of machine learning predictions. Specifically (medical) biosignals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG) could benefit from good UQ, since these suffer from a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and good human interpretability is pivotal for medical applications. In this paper, we review the state of the art of applying Uncertainty Quantification to Machine Learning tasks in the biosignal domain. We present various methods, shortcomings, uncertainty measures and theoretical frameworks that currently exist in this application domain. We address misconceptions in the field, provide recommendations for future work, and discuss gaps in the literature in relation to diagnostic implementations as well as control for prostheses or brain-computer interfaces. Overall it can be concluded that promising UQ methods are available, but that research is needed on how people and systems may interact with an uncertainty-model in a (clinical) environment</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Conventional and Tripolar EEG for High-Performance Reach-to-Grasp BCI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.</description>

      <title>Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral clustering has proven effective in grouping speech representations for speaker diarization tasks, although post-processing the affinity matrix remains difficult due to the need for careful tuning before constructing the Laplacian. In this study, we present a novel pruning algorithm to create a sparse affinity matrix called spectral clustering on p-neighborhood retained affinity matrix (SC-pNA). Our method improves on node-specific fixed neighbor selection by allowing a variable number of neighbors, eliminating the need for external tuning data as the pruning parameters are derived directly from the affinity matrix. SC-pNA does so by identifying two clusters in every row of the initial affinity matrix, and retains only the top p % similarity scores from the cluster containing larger similarities. Spectral clustering is performed subsequently, with the number of clusters determined as the maximum eigengap. Experimental results on the challenging DIHARD-III dataset highlight the superiority of SC-pNA, which is also computationally more efficient than existing auto-tuning approaches. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/nikhilraghav29/SC-pNA.</description>

      <title>FlowDAS: A Stochastic Interpolant-based Framework for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) integrates observations with a dynamical model to estimate states of PDE-governed systems. Model-driven methods (e.g., Kalman, particle) presuppose full knowledge of the true dynamics, which is not always satisfied in practice, while purely data-driven solvers learn a deterministic mapping between observations and states and therefore miss the intrinsic stochasticity of real processes. Recently, score-based diffusion models learn a global diffusion prior and provide a good modeling of the stochastic dynamics, showing new potential for DA. However, their all-at-once generation rather than step-by-step transition limits their performance when dealing with highly complex stochastic processes and lacks physical interpretability. To tackle these drawbacks, we introduce FlowDAS, a generative DA framework that uses stochastic interpolants to directly learn state transition dynamics and achieve step-by-step transition to better model the real dynamics. We also improve the framework by combining the observation, better suiting the DA settings. Directly learning the underlying dynamics from collected data removes restrictive dynamical assumptions, and conditioning on observations at each interpolation step yields stable, measurement-consistent forecasts. Experiments on Lorenz-63, Navier-Stokes super-resolution/sparse-observation scenarios, and large-scale weather forecasting -- where dynamics are partly or wholly unknown -- show that FlowDAS surpasses model-driven methods, neural operators, and score-based baselines in accuracy and physical plausibility.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication System Based on Radio Frequency Resonance Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the complex beam control in traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, researchers have proposed adaptive beam alignment using retro-directive antenna (RDA) arrays. This approach creates echo resonance between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), significantly reducing computational load. However, conventional resonant beam systems (RBS) suffer from echo interference due to the shared uplink and downlink frequency. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative resonance beam-based integrated sensing and communication (RB-ISAC) system designed for efficient passive sensing and bidirectional communication. In this system, the UE operates passively, with both the BS and UE utilizing a phase conjugation and frequency conversion structure to decouple uplink and downlink carrier frequencies, ensuring continuous electromagnetic wave oscillation between the two ends. Effective compensation for signal propagation loss enables resonance after multiple oscillations. At this point, the beam's field forms a low-diffraction-loss, highly focused pattern, automatically aligning the transmitter and receiver. This enables high-precision passive positioning alongside robust uplink and downlink communication. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system achieves resonance within multiple iterations, supporting uplink and downlink communication up to 5 m, and enabling passive direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with an error under 2$^\circ$ .</description>

      <title>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.</description>
