      <title>Measurements and modeling of induced flow in collective vertical migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions among swimming or flying organisms can lead to complex flows on the scale of the group. These emergent fluid dynamics are often more complex than a linear superposition of individual organism flows, especially at intermediate Reynolds numbers. This paper presents an approach to estimate the flow induced by multiple swimmer wakes in proximity using an analytical model that conserves mass and momentum in the aggregation. This analytical model was informed by and validated with empirical measurements of induced vertical migrations of brine shrimp, $\textit{Artemia salina}$. The response of individual swimmers to ambient background flow and light intensity was evaluated. In addition, the time-resolved three-dimensional spatial configuration of the swimmers was measured using a recently developed laser scanning system. Computational experiments using the analytical model found that the induced flow at the front of the aggregation was insensitive to the presence of downstream swimmers, with the induced flow reaching an asymptote beyond a threshold aggregation length. Closer swimmer spacing led to higher induced flow, in some cases leading to model predictions of induced flow exceeding swimmer speeds required to maintain a stable spatial configuration. This result was reconciled by comparing two different models for the near-wake of each swimmer. Our results demonstrate that aggregation-scale flows result from a complex, yet predictable interplay amongst organism-scale wake structure, swimmer spacing and configuration, and aggregation size.</description>

      <title>The minimal seed for transition to convective turbulence in heated pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that buoyancy suppresses, and can even laminarise turbulence in upward heated pipe flow. Heat transfer seriously deteriorates in this case. Through a new DNS model, we confirm that the deteriorated heat transfer within convective turbulence is related to a lack of near-wall rolls, which leads to a weak mixing between the flow near the wall and centre of pipe. Having surveyed the fundamental properties of the system, we perform a nonlinear nonmodal stability analysis. it is found that, the minimal seed becomes thinner and closer to the wall, with increase of buoyancy number C. Most importantly, we show that the critical initial energy required to trigger shear-driven turbulence keeps increasing, implying that attempts to artificially trigger it may not be an efficient means to improve heat transfer at larger C. The new minimal seed, found at C=6, is localised in streamwise direction and is active in the centre of pipe. To find this branch of optimal, we took advantage of a window of linear stability. While the nonlinear optimal causes transition to convective turbulence directly at this and larger C, transition via the linear instability passes via a travelling wave or periodic orbit solutions. Detailed analysis of the periodic solution reveals three stages: growth of the unstable eigenfunction, the formation of streaks, and the decay of streaks due to suppression of the instability. Flow visualization at C up to 10 also show similar features, suggesting that convective turbulence is sustained by these three typical processes.</description>

      <title>Building-block flow model for computational fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a closure model for computational fluid dynamics, referred to as the Building-block Flow Model (BFM). The foundation of the model rests on the premise that a finite collection of simple flows encapsulates the essential physics necessary to predict more complex scenarios. The BFM is implemented using artificial neural networks and introduces five unique advancements within the framework of large-eddy simulation: (1) It is designed to predict multiple flow regimes (wall turbulence under zero, favorable, adverse mean-pressure-gradient, and separation); (2) It unifies the closure model at solid boundaries (i.e., the wall model) and the rest of the flow (i.e., the subgrid-scale model) into a single entity; (3) It ensures consistency with numerical schemes and gridding strategy by accounting for numerical errors; (4) It is directly applicable to arbitrary complex geometries; (5) It can be scaled up to model additional flow physics in the future if needed (e.g., shockwaves and laminar-to-turbulent transition). The BFM is utilized to predict key quantities of interest in turbulent channel flows, a Gaussian bump, and an aircraft in a landing configuration. In all cases, the BFM demonstrates similar or superior capabilities in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art closure models.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of dynamic wetting behavior through curved microchannels with automated image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preventing fluid penetration poses a challenging reliability concern in the context of power electronics, which is usually caused by unforeseen microfractures along the sealing joints. A better and more reliable product design heavily depends on the understanding of the dynamic wetting processes happening inside these complex microfractures, i.e. microchannels. A novel automated image processing procedure is proposed in this work for analyzing the moving interface and the dynamic contact angle in microchannels. In particular, the developed method is advantageous for experiments involving non-transparent samples, where extracting the fluid interface geometry poses a significant challenge. The developed method is validated with theoretical values and manual measurements and exhibits high accuracy. The implementation is made publicly available. The developed method is validated and applied to experimental investigations of forced wetting with two working fluids (water and 50 wt% glycerin/water mixture) in four distinct microchannels characterized by different dimensions and curvature. The comparison between the experimental results and molecular kinetic theory (MKT) reveals that the dynamic wetting behavior can be described well by MKT, even in highly curved microchannels. The dynamic wetting behavior shows a strong dependency on the channel geometry and curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional dynamical systems projected onto a reduced-order model cease to be deterministic and are best described by probability distributions in state space. Their equations of motion map onto an evolution operator with a deterministic component describing the projected dynamics, and a stochastic one from the neglected dimensions. It is shown that, for projections in which the deterministic component is dominant, `physics-free' stochastic Markovian models can be constructed that mimic many of the statistics of the real flow, even for fairly crude operator approximations. Deterministic models converge to steady states. This is related to general properties of Markov chains and illustrated with data-driven models for a moderate-Reynolds number turbulent channel.</description>

      <title>Dynamical pressure boundary condition for weakly-compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamical pressure boundary condition for weakly-compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH). Unlike previous methods that rely on indirect approaches or ghost particles, our method integrates the dynamical boundary pressure directly into the SPH approximation of the pressure gradient on near-boundary particles. Additionally, we develop a meshfree bidirectional in-/outflow buffer by periodically relabelling buffer particles at each time step, a concept that has not been explored before. This simple yet effective buffer facilitates the simulation of both uni- and bidirectional flows, especially those with mixed in-/outflow boundary conditions. We validate the accuracy and convergence of our method through benchmark cases with available analytical solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate its versatility in hemodynamic simulations by investigating generic carotid and aorta flows with the Windkessel model, paving the way for studying the cardiovascular system within a unified meshfree computational framework.</description>

      <title>The effect of spatially-varying collision frequency on the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially- and temporally-constant collision frequency, this work presents 5-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially-varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low to intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate to high case is similar to a fluid limit kinetic case with interface widening biased towards the lower collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low to high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy-flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well-described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.</description>

      <title>Self-enhanced mobility enables vortex pattern formation in living matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence of regular spatial patterns is a hallmark in living matter ranging from subcellular organelles to developing embryos and to ecosystems. Mechanisms for the formation of ordered spatial patterns in biology often require chemical signaling that coordinates cellular behavior and differentiation. Here we discovered a novel route to large-scale regular pattern formation in living matter mediated by purely physical interactions. We found that dense bacterial living matter spontaneously developed an ordered lattice of mesoscale, fast-spinning vortices each consisting of ~10^4-10^5 motile cells; these mesoscale vortices were arranged in space over centimeter scale with apparent hexagonal order, while individual cells in the vortices moved in coordinated directions with strong polar and vortical order. Single-cell tracking and numerical simulations suggest that the phenomenon is enabled by self-enhanced mobility of individual cells in the system. Our findings demonstrate a simple physical mechanism for self-organized pattern formation in living systems and more generally, in other active matter systems near the boundary of fluidlike and solidlike behaviors.</description>

      <title>Vortex pattern stabilization in thin films resulting from shear thickening of active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for structuring on micrometer scales is abundant, for example, in view of phononic applications. We here outline a novel approach based on the phenomenon of active turbulence on the mesoscale. As we demonstrate, a shear-thickening carrier fluid of active microswimmers intrinsically stabilizes regular vortex patterns of otherwise turbulent active suspensions. The fluid self-organizes into a periodically structured nonequilibrium state. Introducing additional passive particles of intermediate size leads to regular spatial organization of these objects. Our approach opens a new path towards functionalization through patterning of thin films and membranes.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for a buckled elastic filament in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the three-dimensional buckling of an elastic filament in a shear flow of a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number and high Peclet number. We apply the Euler-Bernoulli beam (elastica) theoretical model. We show the universal character of the full 3D spectral problem for the small perturbation of the thin filament from a straight position of arbitrary orientation. We use the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the linearized elastica equation in the shear plane, found earlier by [Liu et al., 2024] with the Chebyshev spectral collocation method, to solve the full 3D eigenproblem. We provide a simple analytic approximation to the eigenfunctions, represented as Gaussian wavepackets. As the main result of the paper, we derive square-root dependence of the eigenfunction wavenumber on the parameter $\tilde{\chi}=-\eta \sin 2\phi \sin^2\theta$, where $\eta$ is the elastoviscous number, and the filament orientation is determined by the zenith angle $\theta$ with respect to the vorticity direction and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ relative to the flow direction. We also compare the eigenfunctions with shapes of slightly buckled elastic filaments with a non-negligible thickness with the same Young's modulus, using the bead model and performing numerical simulations with the precise Hydromultipole numerical codes.</description>

      <title>Relative Fluid Stretching and Rotation for Sparse Trajectory Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As most mathematically justifiable Lagrangian coherent structure detection methods rely on spatial derivatives, their applicability to sparse trajectory data has been limited. For experimental fluid dynamicists and natural scientists working with Lagrangian trajectory data via passive tracers in unsteady flows (e.g. Lagrangian particle tracking or ocean buoys), obtaining material measures of fluid rotation or stretching is currently only possible for trajectory concentrations that are often out-of-reach. To facilitate frame-indifferent investigations in unsteady and sparsely sampled flows, we present a novel approach to quantify fluid stretching and rotation via relative Lagrangian velocities. This technique provides a formal objective extension of quasi-objective metrics to unsteady flows by accounting for mean flow behavior. For extremely sparse experimental data, fluid structures may be significantly undersampled, and the mean flow behavior becomes difficult to quantify. We provide a means to maintain the accuracy of our novel sparse flow diagnostics in extremely sparse sampling scenarios, such as ocean buoy data and Lagrangian particle tracking. We use data from multiple numerical and experimental flows to show that our methods can identify structures beyond existing limits of sparse, frame-indifferent diagnostics, and exhibit improved interpretability over common frame-dependent diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Large-Scale Statistical Solutions to Incompressible Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the development, performance analysis and subsequent optimization of a GPU-based spectral hyperviscosity solver for turbulent flows described by the three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method solves for the fluid velocity fields directly in Fourier space, eliminating the need to solve a large-scale linear system of equations in order to find the pressure field. Special focus is put on the communication intensive transpose operation required by the fast Fourier transform when using distributed memory parallelism. After multiple iterations of benchmarking and improving the code, the simulation achieves close to optimal performance on the Piz Daint supercomputer cluster, even outperforming the Cray MPI implementation on Piz Daint in its communication routines. This optimal performance enables the computation of large-scale statistical solutions of incompressible fluid flows in three space dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Nonrelativistic Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.</description>
