      <title>A note on accurate pressure calculations of Coulomb systems with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we address some issues concerning the accurate pressure calculation of Coulomb systems with periodic boundary conditions. First, we prove that the formulas for the excess part of the pressure with Ewald summation also reduce to the ensemble average of one-third of the ratio between the potential energy and the volume so that the comments on our previous work in a recent paper by [Onegin~\emph{et al}.,~J. Phys. A: Math.~Theor.~57 (2024) 205002] are incorrect. Second, we demonstrate that in charge non-neutral systems, the pressure expression must be corrected to include interactions with the neutralizing background. This addresses the issues about pressure computation in LAMMPS raised in the paper by Onegin {\it et al.}. Numerical experiments are performed to verify that the pressure obtained via Ewald summation with corrected terms agrees with the average pressure using thermodynamics for the non-neutral OCP system, and are independent of the splitting parameter in the Ewald summation.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large-Scale and High-Precision Fluid Simulations on Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computational fluid dynamics (QCFD) offers a promising alternative to classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging quantum algorithms for higher efficiency. This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method implemented on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimension matrix, marking the largest simulation on a quantum computer to date. Our approach bridges quantum and classical computing, adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, which paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate models for open quantum systems -- quantum states that have non-trivial interactions with their environment -- may aid in the advancement of a diverse array of fields, including quantum computation, informatics, and the prediction of static and dynamic molecular properties. In recent years, quantum algorithms have been leveraged for the computation of open quantum systems as the predicted quantum advantage of quantum devices over classical ones may allow previously inaccessible applications. Accomplishing this goal will require input and expertise from different research perspectives, as well as the training of a diverse quantum workforce, making a compilation of current quantum methods for treating open quantum systems both useful and timely. In this Review, we first provide a succinct summary of the fundamental theory of open quantum systems and then delve into a discussion on recent quantum algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of pertinent applications, demonstrating the applicability of this field to realistic chemical, biological, and material systems.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to incorporating intermolecular dispersion into the openCOSMO-RS model. Part 1: Halocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) is a predictive thermodynamic model that has found diverse applications in various domains like chemical engineering, environmental chemistry, nanotechnology, material science, and biotechnology. Its core concept involves calculating the screening charge density on the surface of each molecule and letting these surface patches interact with each other to calculate thermodynamic properties. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of the open-source implementation openCOSMO-RS by incorporating dispersive interactions between the paired segments. Several parametrizations were systematically evaluated through the extensive regression analysis using a comprehensive database of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE), Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE) and Infinite Dilution Activity Coefficients (IDACs). Furthermore, the influence of different combinatorial terms on the model performance was investigated. Our findings indicate that incorporating dispersive interactions significantly improves the accuracy of phase equilibrium predictions for halocarbons and refrigerant mixtures.</description>

      <title>Extremization to Fine Tune Physics Informed Neural Networks for Solving Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fast and accurate training of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to find solutions to boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial boundary value problems (IBVPs). By combining the methods of training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), we develop a model which has the expressivity of DNNs with the fine-tuning ability of ELMs. We showcase the superiority of our proposed method by solving several BVPs and IBVPs which include linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and coupled PDEs. The examples we consider include a stiff coupled ODE system where traditional numerical methods fail, a 3+1D non-linear PDE, Kovasznay flow and Taylor-Green vortex solutions to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and pure advection solution of 1+1 D compressible Euler equation.
  The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is used to exactly impose initial and boundary conditions (IBCs) of (I)BVPs on PINNs. We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Probably the simplest and cheapest quantum Monte Carlo method so far for extracting high-precision entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\'enyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a non-local kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column with periodic boundary conditions and for the entire discharge to study near-electrode effects within a 1d model with radial ambipolar loss. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field) is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for a wide range of driving frequencies because heat conduction occurs much faster than the ambipolar diffusion controlled by slow ion motion. We demonstrate that standing striations in symmetric AC discharges previously observed in experiments are similar to moving striations in DC discharges and are both due to nonlocal kinetic effects at low discharge currents.</description>

      <title>Fisher's Mirage: Noise Tightening of Cosmological Constraints in Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the implications of statistical noise within numerical derivatives on simulation-based Fisher forecasts for large scale structure surveys. Noisy numerical derivatives resulting from a finite number of simulations, $N_{sims}$, act to bias the associated Fisher forecast such that the resulting marginalized constraints can be significantly tighter than the noise-free limit. We show the source of this effect can be traced to the influence of the noise on the marginalization process. Parameters such as the neutrino mass, $\M$, for which higher-order forward differentiation schemes are commonly used, are more prone to noise; the predicted constraints can be akin to those purely from a random instance of statistical noise even using $(1\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^{3}$ simulations with $N_{sims}=500$ realizations. We demonstrate how derivative noise can artificially reduce parameter degeneracies and seemingly null the effects of adding nuisance parameters to the forecast, such as HOD fitting parameters. We mathematically characterize these effects through a full statistical analysis, and demonstrate how confidence intervals for the true noise-free, $N_{sims} \rightarrow \infty$, Fisher constraints can be recovered even when noise comprises a consequential component of the measured signal. The findings and approaches developed here are important for ensuring simulation-based analyses can be accurately used to assess upcoming survey capabilities.</description>

      <title>Large dynamical magnetic effective charges and anti-magnetoelectricity from spin and orbital origin in multiferroic BiCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we explore the magnetoelectric properties of the room-temperature multiferroic crystal BiCoO$_3$. We use both applied magnetic field and finite-difference techniques to show that BiCoO$_3$ is anti-magnetoelectric at the linear level. The calculation of the dynamical effective charges reveals that the total magnetoelectric response is zero due to the compensating non-zero magnetoelectric response of each magnetic sublattice. This calculation also highlights that the the orbital contribution to the response is remarkably larger than the spin one and that each sublattice has a rather large total magnetoelectric response of 85 ps/m. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive recipe to visualize the dynamical magnetic effective charge, allowing to examine its multipolar nature which we confirm by means of ab initio calculations. Given the large value of the local response, we investigate the ferromagnetic phase as well, which gives a giant magnetoelectric response of about 1000 ps/m and coming mainly from the spin contribution this time. Finally, we discuss the possible reasons for such a large magnetoelectric response in BiCoO3 and propose possible strategies to unveil this potentially large response.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis and Numerical Algorithm for PDE Approximation with Hidden-Layer Concatenated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the hidden-layer concatenated physics informed neural network (HLConcPINN) method, which combines hidden-layer concatenated feed-forward neural networks, a modified block time marching strategy, and a physics informed approach for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Meta-GGAs vs. Hybrid Functionals for Point Defects: The Best of Both Worlds Applied to Layered MnO$_2$, NiO$_2$ and KCoO$_2$</title>

Abstract: Defects in a material can significantly tune properties and enhance utility. Hybrid functionals like HSE06 are often used to describe solids with such defects. However, geometry optimization (including accounting for effects such as Jahn-Teller distortion) using hybrid functionals is challenging for the large supercells needed for defect study. The proposed r$^2$SCAN+rVV10+U+$\mathrm{U_d}$ method, which is computationally much cheaper and faster than hybrid functionals, can successfully describe defects in materials with the proper choice of U (for the d orbitals of the host atom) and $\mathrm{U_d}$ (for those of the defect atom), as shown here for small polaron defects in layered transition-metal oxides. We use a literature value of U or $\mathrm{U_d}$ appropriate to a given transition-metal ion and its oxidation state. The layered materials birnessite ($\mathrm{K_nMnO_2}, n=0.03 $) and $\mathrm{K_nNiO_2},n=0.03$, with one K atom intercalated between layers in a supercell, are found to have one localized occupied $\mathrm{e_g}$ polaronic state on the transition metal ion reduced by the insertion of the K atom, when the geometry is calculated as above using published U values. The expected Jahn-Teller distortion is not observed when U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0. Layered cobalt oxide with additional potassium ions intercalated ($\mathrm{K_nCoO_2},n=1.03$) is different, due to a dramatic difference in electronic configuration of the defected Co(II) ion: A single extra K atom in the supercell leads to four localized electrons in the band gap, using standard U values, and even for U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations</title>

Abstract: The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid. One of the roles of mucus is to protect the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. It is transported by mucocilliary clearance toward the tracheo-pharyngeal bifurcation, where it is eliminated. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, the mucus layer is subject to surface tension forces that interact with its rheology. It is still not clear whether these forces can affect mucus displacement and, if they can, under what conditions and how this displacement can occur. In this work, we model the mucus as a thin Bingham fluid layer located on the wall of idealized, multi-scaled airway bifurcations. We analyze the resulting physical system using lubrication theory and 3D simulations. The theoretical analysis allows us to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the system and determine the geometric conditions under which the Bingham fluid can be moved by surface tension. 3D simulations are then used to quantify the effects in idealized airway bifurcations on a range of scales corresponding to those of bronchial bifurcations. Our results suggest that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations, a typical situation in obstructive lung pathologies (asthma, BPCO, cystic fobrosis, etc.). Moreover, our results indicate that this movement can disrupt mucociliary clearance and the homogeneity of the layer thickness, thus increasing the risk of lung infection.</description>

Abstract: Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics. Here we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz [D. Pfau et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033429 (2020).] for variational Monte Carlo calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitatively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification based on the idea of an antisymmetric geminal power singlet (AGPs) wave function. The new AGPs FermiNet outperforms the original FermiNet significantly in paired systems, giving results which are more accurate than fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and are consistent with experiment. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz, which only differs from the original Ansatz by the method of antisymmetrization, is a strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantages with the original FermiNet: the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and the flexibility of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluids.</description>

      <title>Efficient circular Dyson Brownian motion algorithm</title>

Abstract: Circular Dyson Brownian motion describes the Brownian dynamics of particles on a circle (periodic boundary conditions), interacting through a logarithmic, long-range two-body potential. Within the log-gas picture of random matrix theory, it describes the level dynamics of unitary ("circular") matrices. A common scenario is that one wants to know about an initial configuration evolved over a certain interval of time, without being interested in the intermediate dynamics. Numerical evaluation of this is computationally expensive as the time-evolution algorithm is accurate only on short time intervals because of an underlying perturbative approximation. This work proposes an efficient and easy-to-implement improved circular Dyson Brownian motion algorithm for the unitary class (Dyson index $\beta = 2$, physically corresponding to broken time-reversal symmetry). The algorithm allows one to study time evolution over arbitrarily large intervals of time at a fixed computational cost, with no approximations being involved.</description>

      <title>Ab initio framework for deciphering trade-off relationships in multi-component alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While first-principles methods have been successfully applied to characterize individual properties of multi-principal element alloys (MPEA), their use to search for optimal trade-offs between competing properties is hampered by high computational demands. In this work, we present a novel framework to explore Pareto-optimal compositions by integrating advanced ab initio-based techniques into a Bayesian multi-objective optimization workflow complemented with a simple analytical model providing straightforward analysis of trends. We benchmark the framework by applying it to solid solution strengthening and ductility of refractory MPEAs, with the parameters of the strengthening and ductility models being efficiently computed using a combination of the coherent-potential approximation method, accounting for finite-temperature effects, and actively-learned moment-tensor potentials parameterized with ab initio data. Properties obtained from ab initio calculations are subsequently used to extend predictions of all relevant material properties to a large class of refractory alloys with the help of the analytical model validated by the data and relying on a few element-specific parameters and universal functions that describe bonding between elements. Our findings offer new crucial insights into the traditional strength-vs-ductility dilemma of refractory MPEAs. The proposed framework is versatile and can be extended to other materials and properties of interest, enabling a predictive and tractable high-throughput screening of Pareto-optimal MPEAs over the entire composition space.</description>

      <title>Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonators dynamics: temporal coupled-mode theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread significance, the temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) lacks a foundational validation based on electromagnetic principles and stands as a phenomenological theory relying on fitted coupling coefficients. We employ an ab initio Maxwellian approach using quasinormal-mode theory to derive an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation for resonator dynamics. While the resulting differential equation bears resemblance to the classical one, it introduces novel terms embodying distinct physics, suggesting that the CMT predictions could be faulted by dedicated experiments, for instance carried out with short and off-resonance pulses, or with resonators of sizes comparable to or greater than the wavelength. Nonetheless, our examination indicates that, despite its inherent lack of strictness, the CMT enables precise predictions for numerous experiments due to the flexibility provided by the fitted coupling coefficients. The new EME equation is anticipated to be applicable to all electromagnetic resonator geometries, and the theoretical approach we have taken can be extended to other wave physics.</description>

      <title>Collocation methods for nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new methods for integrating nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds. The methods are based on oblique projectors onto the tangent spaces of low-rank manifolds with an interpolation property that collocates the differential equation on the manifold. These projections yield evolution equations that enable low-rank time integration of any vectorfield that can be evaluated entry-wise. The proposed methods do not require the vectorfield to have a low-rank structure, thus overcoming significant limitations of dynamical low-rank approximation based on orthogonal projection. To construct the oblique projectors, we devise a sparse tensor sampling algorithm based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) that parameterizes tensor train manifolds and their tangent spaces with cross interpolation. Using these projectors we propose two time integration schemes on low-rank tensor train manifolds. The first is based on a time-dependent tensor cross interpolation representation of the solution and the second is a direct generalization of the well-known orthogonal projector-splitting integrator to a oblique projectors. We demonstrate the proposed methods with applications to several tensor differential equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Error Field Predictability and Consequences for ITER</title>

Abstract: ITER coil tolerances are re-evaluated using the modern understanding of coupling to least-stable plasma modes and an updated center-line-traced model of ITER's coil windings. This reassessment finds the tolerances to be conservative through a statistical, linear study of $n=1$ error fields (EFs) due to tilted, shifted misplacements and nominal windings of central solenoid and poloidal field coils within tolerance. We also show that a model-based correction scheme remains effective even when metrology quality is sub-optimal, and compare this to projected empirical correction schemes. We begin with an analysis of the necessity of error field correction (EFC) for daily operation in ITER using scaling laws for the EF penetration threshold. We then consider the predictability of EF dominant mode overlap across early planned ITER scenarios and, as measuring EFs in high power scenarios can pose risks to the device, the potential for extrapolation to the ITER Baseline Scenario (IBS). We find that carefully designing a scenario matching currents proportionally to those of the IBS is far more important than plasma shape or profiles in accurately measuring an optimal correction current set.</description>
