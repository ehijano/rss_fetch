      <title>Chemical Shift Encoding based Double Bonds Quantification in Triglycerides using Deep Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated a deep learning-based method using Deep Image Prior (DIP) to quantify triglyceride double bonds from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo gradient echo images without network training. We employed a cost function based on signal constraints to iteratively update the neural network on a single dataset. The method was validated using phantom experiments and in vivo scans. Results showed close alignment between measured and reference double bond values, with phantom experiments yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 (p = .0005). In vivo results demonstrated good agreement in subcutaneous fat. We conclude that Deep Image Prior shows feasibility for quantifying double bonds and fatty acid content from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo MRI.</description>

      <title>Interplay between MRI-based axon diameter and myelination estimates in macaque and human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axon diameter and myelin thickness are closely related microstructural tissue properties that affect the conduction velocity of action potentials in the nervous system. Imaging them non-invasively with MRI-based methods is thus valuable for studying brain microstructure and function. However, the relationship between MRI-based axon diameter and myelination measures has not been investigated across the brain, mainly due to methodological limitations in estimating axon diameters. In recent years, studies using ultra-high gradient strength diffusion MRI (dMRI) have demonstrated improved estimation of axon diameter across white-matter (WM) tracts in the human brain, making such investigations feasible. In this study, we aim to investigate relationships between tissue microstructure properties with MRI-based methods and compare the imaging findings to histological evidence from the literature. We collected dMRI with ultra-high gradient strength and multi-echo spin-echo MRI on ex vivo macaque and human brain samples on a preclinical scanner. From these data, we estimated axon diameter, intra-axonal signal fraction, myelin water fraction (MWF) and aggregate g-ratio and investigated their correlations. We found that the microstructural imaging parameters exhibited consistent patterns across WM tracts and species. Overall, the findings suggest that MRI-based axon geometry and myelination measures can provide complementary information about fiber morphology, and the relationships between these measures agree with prior histological evidence.</description>

      <title>Joint regional uptake quantification of Thorium-227 and Radium-223 using a multiple-energy-window projection-domain quantitative SPECT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorium-227-based alpha-particle radiopharmaceutical therapies ({\alpha}-RPTs) are being investigated in several clinical and pre-clinical studies. After administration, Thorium-227 decays to Radium-223, another alpha-particle-emitting isotope, which redistributes within the patient. Reliable dose quantification of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 is clinically important, and SPECT may perform this quantification as these isotopes also emit X- and gamma-ray photons. However, reliable quantification is challenged by the orders-of-magnitude lower activity compared to conventional SPECT, resulting in a very low number of detected counts, the presence of multiple photopeaks, substantial overlap in the emission spectra of these isotopes, and the image-degrading effects in SPECT. To address these issues, we propose a multiple-energy-window projection-domain quantification (MEW-PDQ) method that jointly estimates the regional activity uptake of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 directly using the SPECT projection from multiple energy windows. We evaluated the method with realistic simulation studies using anthropomorphic digital phantoms, in the context of imaging patients with bone metastases of prostate cancer and treated with Thorium-227-based {\alpha}-RPTs. The proposed method yielded reliable (accurate and precise) regional uptake estimates of both isotopes and outperformed state-of-the-art methods across different lesion sizes and contrasts, in a virtual imaging trial, as well as with moderate levels of intra-regional heterogeneous uptake and with moderate inaccuracies in the definitions of the support of various regions. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of using multiple energy windows and the variance of the estimated uptake using the proposed method approached the Cram\'er-Rao-lower-bound-defined theoretical limit.</description>

      <title>Analytic Approximation of Free-Space Path Loss for Implanted Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implantable wireless bioelectronic devices enable communication and/or power transfer through RF wireless connections with external nodes. These devices encounter notable design challenges due to the lossy nature of the host body, which significantly diminishes the radiation efficiency of the implanted antenna and tightens the wireless link budget. Prior research has yielded closed-form approximate expressions for estimating losses occurring within the lossy host body, known as the in-body path loss. To assess the total path loss between the implanted transmitter and external receiver, this paper focuses on the free-space path loss of the implanted antenna, from the body-air interface to the external node. This is not trivial, as in addition to the inherent radial spreading of spherical electromagnetic waves common to all antennas, implanted antennas confront additional losses arising from electromagnetic scattering at the interface between the host body and air. Employing analytical modeling, we propose closed-form approximate expressions for estimating this free-space path loss. The approximation is formulated as a function of the free-space distance, the curvature radius of the body-air interface, the depth of the implanted antenna, and the permittivity of the lossy medium. This proposed method undergoes thorough validation through numerical calculations, simulations, and measurements for different implanted antenna scenarios. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the path loss in implanted antennas and provides a reliable analytical framework for their efficient design and performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in large foundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a fully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation oncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning protocols as context and acts as an expert human planner, capable of guiding a treatment planning process. Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical protocols for various disease sites as prompts to enable GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan agent is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an API. The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased using multiple prostate and head &amp; neck cancer cases, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk sparing. Consistently satisfying the dosimetric objectives in the clinical protocol, GPT-RadPlan represents the first multimodal large language model agent that mimics the behaviors of human planners in radiation oncology clinics, achieving remarkable results in automating the treatment planning process without the need for additional training.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the BOLDPET optical prototype, an innovative Cherenkov detector for 511 keV $\gamma$ radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we describe the design, construction, and testing of the optical prototype developed for the BOLDPET project, with the objective of creating a PET detection module with high spatial and time resolution. The BOLDPET technology uses an innovative detection liquid, trimethylbismuth, for detecting 511 keV $\gamma$-quanta resulting from positron annihilation. The optical signal is exclusively produced through the Cherenkov mechanism, and the produced photons are detected using Planacon microchannel-plate photomultiplier. We achieve an excellent time resolution of 150 ps (FWHM) within a sizable detection volume measuring 55 mm x 55 mm x 25 mm. Through detailed Geant4 simulations, we examine the limiting factors affecting time resolution and explore potential avenues for improvement. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of coarse 2D localization of interactions using the optical signal alone, achieving a precision of about 5-8 mm (FWHM) within the homogeneous detection volume.</description>

      <title>Metric-guided Image Reconstruction Bounds via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have led to the development of novel medical imaging systems and algorithms that address ill-posed problems. Assessing their trustworthiness and understanding how to deploy them safely at test time remains an important and open problem. In this work, we propose using conformal prediction to compute valid and distribution-free bounds on downstream metrics given reconstructions generated by one algorithm, and retrieve upper/lower bounds and inlier/outlier reconstructions according to the adjusted bounds. Our work offers 1) test time image reconstruction evaluation without ground truth, 2) downstream performance guarantees, 3) meaningful upper/lower bound reconstructions, and 4) meaningful statistical inliers/outlier reconstructions. We demonstrate our method on post-mastectomy radiotherapy planning using 3D breast CT reconstructions, and show 1) that metric-guided bounds have valid coverage for downstream metrics while conventional pixel-wise bounds do not and 2) anatomical differences of upper/lower bounds between metric-guided and pixel-wise methods. Our work paves way for more meaningful and trustworthy test-time evaluation of medical image reconstructions. Code available at https://github.com/matthewyccheung/conformal-metric</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>
