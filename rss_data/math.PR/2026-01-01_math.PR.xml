      <description>arXiv:2512.23845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a m-dimensional Gaussian process and polynomial m variables with real coefficients, we calculate the induced path odered exponenial in two different ways: one is purely algebraic in spirit and the other one is diagrammatic in spirit and uses multigraph labelings (and is inspired by the use of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory).</description>

      <title>Concentration and fluctuations of sine-Gordon measure around topological multi-soliton manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon measure defined on each homotopy class. The energy space decomposes into infinitely many such classes indexed by the topological degree $Q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Even though the sine-Gordon action admits no minimizer in homotopy classes with $|Q| \ge 2$, we prove that the Gibbs measure on each class nevertheless concentrates and exhibits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fluctuations near the multi-soliton manifold in the joint low-temperature and infinite-volume limit. Furthermore, we show that the joint distribution of the multi-soliton centers coincides with the ordered statistics of independent uniform random variables, so that each soliton's location follows a Beta distribution.</description>

      <title>Yaglom theorem for critical branching random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical branching random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ started from a distant point $x$ and conditioned to hit some compact set $K$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We are interested in the occupation time in $K$ and present its asymptotic behaviors in different dimensions. It is shown in this work that the occupation time is of order $\|x\|^{4-d}$ in dimensions $d\leq 3$, of order $\log\|x\|$ in dimension $d=4$, and of order 1 in dimensions $d\geq 5$. The corresponding weak convergences are also established. These results answer a question raised by Le Gall and Merle (Elect. Comm. in Probab. 11 (2006), 252-265).</description>

      <title>Gaussian free fields on Hamming graphs and lattice spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a class of discrete Gaussian free fields on Hamming graphs, where interactions are determined solely by the Hamming distance between vertices. The purpose of examining this class is that it differs significantly from the commonly discussed spin system on the integer lattice with nearest-neighbour interactions. After introducing general results on the partition function and covariance for the class of Gaussian free fields, we present detailed properties of some specific models. Group-theoretic arguments and the Fourier transform give some explicit results.</description>

      <title>Universality of cutoff for independent random walks on the circle conditioned not to intersect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider a class of Markov processes on the discrete circle which has been introduced by K\"onig, O'Connell and Roch. These processes describe movements of exchangeable interacting particles and are discrete analogues of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion: a random number of particles jump together either to the left or to the right, with trajectories conditioned to never intersect. We provide asymptotic mixing times for stochastic processes in this class as the number of particles goes to infinity, under a sub-Gaussian assumption on the random number of particles moving at each step. As a consequence, we prove that a cutoff phenomenon holds independently of the transition probabilities, subject only to the sub-Gaussian assumption and a minimal aperiodicity hypothesis. Finally, an application to dimer models on the hexagonal lattice is provided.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed distributions; extreme value theory; large deviations; ruin probabilities; solvency risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp large deviation asymptotics for the maximum order statistic of independent and identically distributed heavy-tailed random variables, valid for all Borel subsets of the right tail. This result yields exact decay rates for exceedance probabilities at thresholds that grow faster than the natural extreme-value scaling. As an application, we derive the polynomial rate of decay of ruin probabilities in insurance portfolios where insolvency is driven by a single extreme claim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the Euclidean distance between two independent random vectors uniformly distributed on $l_p^n$-balls $(1 \leq p \leq \infty)$ or on its boundary satisfies a central limit theorem as $n$ tends to $\infty$. Also, we give a compact proof of the case of the sphere, which was proved by Hammersley. Furthermore, we complement our central limit theorem by providing large deviation principles for the cases $p \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Solutions to the Skorokhod Reflection Problem Driven by Jump Processes and an Application to Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reflected process in the positive orthant driven by an exogenous jump process. For a given input process, we show that there exists a unique minimal strong solution to the given particle system up until a certain maximal stopping time, which is stated explicitly in terms of the dual formulation of a linear programming problem associated with the state of the system. We apply this model to study the ruin time of interconnected insurance firms, where the stopping time can be interpreted as the failure time of a reinsurance agreement between the firms. Our work extends the analysis of the particle system in Baker, Hambly, and Jettkant (2025) to the case of jump driving processes, and the existence result of Reiman (1984) beyond the case of sub-stochastic reflection matrices.</description>

      <title>The Dual Majorizing Measure Theorem for Canonical Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterize the boundedness of the log-concave-tailed canonical processes. The corresponding new majorizing measure theorem for log-concave-tailed canonical processes is proved using the new tree structure. Moreover, we introduce the new growth condition. Combining this condition with the dual majorizing measure theorem proven in the paper, we have developed a polynomial-time algorithm for computing expected supremum of the log-concave canonical processes.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with large damping in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time mixing behavior of the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\le 3$. It is well known that, under a sufficiently strong damping force, the system admits unique ergodicity, although the rate of convergence toward equilibrium has remained unknown. In this work, we address the mixing property in the regime of large damping and establish that solutions are attracted toward the unique invariant probability measure at polynomial rates of arbitrary order. Our approach is based on a coupling strategy with pathwise Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>From boundary random walks to Feller's Brownian Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an invariance principle connecting boundary random walks on $\mathbb N$ with Feller's Brownian motions on $[0,\infty)$. A Feller's Brownian motion is a Feller process on $[0,\infty)$ whose excursions away from the boundary $0$ coincide with those of a killed Brownian motion, while its behavior at the boundary is characterized by a quadruple $(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)$. This class encompasses many classical models, including absorbed, reflected, elastic, and sticky Brownian motions, and further allows boundary jumps from $0$ governed by the measure $p_4$. For any Feller's Brownian motion that is not purely driven by jumps at the boundary, we construct a sequence of boundary random walks whose appropriately rescaled processes converge weakly to the given Feller's Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>The tournament ratchet's clicktime process, and metastability in a Moran model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. In the classical variant, an individual's selective advantage is proportional to the difference between the population average and the individual's mutation load, whereas in the ratchet with {\em tournament selection} only the signs of the differences of the individual mutation loads matter. In a parameter regime which leads to slow clicking (i.e. to a loss of the currently fittest class at a rate $\ll 1/N$) we prove that the rescaled process of click times of the tournament ratchet converges as $N\to \infty$ to a Poisson process. Central ingredients in the proof are a thorough analysis of the metastable behaviour of a two-type Moran model with selection and deleterious mutation (which describes the size of the fittest class up to its extinction time) and a lower estimate on the size of the new fittest class at a clicktime.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Markov processes with jump kernels blowing-up at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes on closed subsets of ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d\ge 1$, with jump kernels of the form $J(x,y)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}{\mathcal B}(x,y)$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\mathcal B}(x,y)$ may blow up at the boundary of the state space. This extends the framework developed recently for conservative self-similar Markov processes on the upper half-space to a broader geometric setting. Examples of Markov processes that fall into our general framework include traces of isotropic $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1,\rm Dini}$ sets, processes in Lipschitz sets arising in connection with the nonlocal Neumann problem, and a large class of resurrected self-similar processes in the closed upper half-space.
  We establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for these Markov processes. A fundamental difficulty in accomplishing this task is that, in contrast to the existing literature on heat kernels for jump processes, the tails of the associated jump measures in our setting are not uniformly bounded. Thus, standard techniques in the existing literature used to study heat kernels are not applicable. To overcome this obstacle, we employ recently developed weighted functional inequalities specifically designed for jump kernels blowing up at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Gibbs conditioning principle for log-concave independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu_1,\nu_2,\dots$ be a sequence of probabilities on the nonnegative integers, and $X=(X_1,X_2, \dots)$ be a sequence of independent random variables $X_i$ with law $\nu_i$. For $\lambda&gt;0$ denote $Z^\lambda_i:= \sum_x \lambda^x\nu_i(x)$ and $\lambda^{\max}:= \sup\{\lambda&gt;0: Z^\lambda_i&lt;\infty \text{ for all }i\}$, and assume $\lambda^{\max}&gt;1$. For $\lambda&lt;\lambda^{\max}$, define the tilted probability $\nu_i^{\lambda}(x):= \lambda^x\nu_i(x)/Z^{\lambda}_i$, and let $X^\lambda$ be a sequence of independent variables $X^\lambda_i$ with law $\nu^{\lambda}_i$, and denote $S^\lambda_n:= X^{\lambda}_1+\dots+X^{\lambda}_n$, with $S_n=S^1_n$. Choose $\lambda^*\in(1,\lambda^{\max})$ and denote $R^*_n:= E (S^{\lambda^*}_n)$. The Gibbs Conditioning Principle (GCP) holds if $P(X\in\cdot|S_n&gt;R^*_n)$ converges weakly to the law of $X^{\lambda^*}$, as $n\to\infty$. We prove the GCP for log-concave $\nu_i$'s, meaning $\nu_i(x+1)\,\nu_i(x-1) \le ( \nu_i(x))^2$, subject to a technical condition that prevents condensation. The canonical measures are the distributions of the first $n$ variables, conditioned on their sum being $k$. Efron's theorem states that for log-concave $\nu_i$'s, the canonical measures are stochastically ordered with respect to $k$. This, in turn, leads to the ordering of the conditioned tilted measures $P(X^\lambda\in\cdot|S^\lambda_n&gt;R^*_n)$ in terms of $\lambda$. This ordering is a fundamental component of our proof.</description>

      <title>The local limit of weighted spanning trees on balanced networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the local limit of the weighted spanning trees on any simple connected high degree almost regular sequence of electric networks is the Poisson(1) branching process conditioned to survive forever, by generalizing [NP22] and closing a gap in their proof. We also study the local statistics of the WST's on high degree almost balanced sequences, which is interesting even for the uniform spanning trees.
  Our motivation comes from studying an interpolation $\{\mathsf{WST}^{\beta}(G)\}_{\beta\in [0, \infty)}$ between UST(G) and MST(G) by WST's on a one-parameter family of random environments. This model has recently been introduced in [MSS24, K\'us24], and the phases of several properties have been determined on the complete graphs.
  We show a phase transition of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(G_n)$ regarding the local limit and expected edge overlaps for high degree almost balanced graph sequences $G_n$, without any structural assumptions on the graphs; while the expected total length is sensitive to the global structure of the graphs. Our general framework results in a better understanding even in the case of complete graphs, where it narrows the window of the phase transition of [Mak24].</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; 2\gamma/(1+\gamma)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Fixed Point Biased Pattern Avoiding Involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fixed point biased involutions that avoid a pattern. For every pattern of length three we obtain limit theorems for the asymptotic distribution of the (appropriately centered and scaled) number of fixed points of a random fixed point biased involution avoiding that pattern. When the pattern being avoided is either $321$, $132$, or $213$, we find a phase transition depending on the strength of the bias. We also obtain a limit theorem for distribution of fixed points when the pattern is $123\cdots k(k+1)$ for any $k$ and partial results when the pattern is $(k+1)k\cdots 321$.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Generalized Counting Process via Gamma Subordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multivariate gamma subordinator whose components are independent gamma processes subject to a random time governed by an independent negative binomial process. We derive the explicit expressions for its joint Laplace-Stieltjes transform, its probability density function and the associated governing differential equations. Also, we study a time-changed variant of the multivariate generalized counting process where the time is changed by an independent multivariate gamma subordinator. For this time-changed process, we obtain the corresponding L\'evy measure and probability mass function. Later, we discuss an application of the time-changed multivariate generalized counting process to a shock model.</description>

      <title>A Review of Diffusion-based Simulation-Based Inference: Foundations and Applications in Non-Ideal Data Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits for weighted empirical approximations of tilted distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.</description>

      <title>On the finiteness of the group associated with weighted walks in multidimensional orthants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of walks with small steps confined to multidimensional orthants, a certain group of transformations plays a central role. In particular, several techniques to potentially compute the generating function, including the orbit sum method, can only be applied when this group is finite. In this note, we present three new results concerning this group. First, in two dimensions, we provide a complete characterization of the weight parameters that yield a finite group. In higher dimensions, we show that whenever the group is finite, it must necessarily be isomorphic to a simpler reflection group. Finally, in dimension three, we give a full classification of the parameters leading to a finite group that also satisfies an additional Weyl property.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Kac particle system converges, as the number of particles tends to infinity, to the solution of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation, in the regime of moderately soft potentials, $\gamma \in (-2,0)$ with the common notation. This proves the propagation of chaos. We adapt the recent work of Imbert, Silvestre and Villani, to show that the Fisher information is nonincreasing in time along solutions to the Kac master equation. This estimate allows us to control the singularity of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation of Random Process via Stochastic Interpolation Neural Network Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.</description>

      <title>The $k$-Plancherel measure and a Finite Markov Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}_k(n)$ denote the set of partitions of $n$ whose largest part is bounded by $k,$ which are in well-known bijection with $(k+1)$-cores $\mathcal{C}_k$. We study a growth process on $\mathcal{C}_k$, whose stationary distribution is the $k$-Plancherel measure, which is a natural extension of the Plancherel measure in the context of $k$-Schur functions. When $k\to\infty$ it converges to the Plancherel measure for partitions, a limit studied first by Vershik-Kerov. However, when $k$ is fixed and $n\to \infty$, we conjecture that it converges to a shape close to the limit shape from the uniform growth of partitions, as studied by Rost. We show that the limiting behavior, for fixed $k$, is governed by a finite Markov chain with $k!$ states over a subset of the $k$-bounded partitions or equivalently as a TASEP over cyclic permutations of length $k+1$. This paper initiates the study of these processes, state some theorems and several intriguing conjectures found by computations of the finite Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Limits of Deterministic and Stochastic Flocking Models with Nonlinear Velocity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit for a class of agent-based models describing flocking with nonlinear velocity alignment. Each agent interacts through a communication protocol $\phi$ and a non-linear coupling of velocities given by the power law $A(\bv) = |\bv|^{p-2}\bv$, $p &gt; 2$. The mean-field limit is proved in two settings -- deterministic and stochastic. We then provide quantitative estimates on propagation of chaos for deterministic case in the case of the classical fat-tailed kernels, showing an improved convergence rate of the $k$-particle marginals to a solution of the corresponding Vlasov equation. The stochastic version is addressed with multiplicative noise depending on the local interaction intensity, which leads to the associated Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation.
  Our results extend the classical Cucker-Smale theory to the nonlinear framework which has received considerable attention in the literature recently.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline Gibbs states in 4-dimensional lattice-gas models with finite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free estimators of gradients of functions with(out) non-independent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified stochastic framework for approximating and computing the gradient of every smooth function evaluated at non-independent variables, using $\ell_p$-spherical distributions on $\R^d$ with $d, p\geq 1$. The upper-bounds of the bias of the gradient surrogates do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality for any $p\geq 1$. Also, the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the gradient estimators are bounded by $K_0 N^{-1} d$ for any $p \in [1, 2]$, and by $K_1 N^{-1} d^{2/p}$ when $2 \leq p \ll d$ with $N$ the sample size and $K_0, K_1$ some constants. Taking $\max\left\{2, \log(d) \right\} &lt; p \ll d$ allows for achieving dimension-free upper-bounds of MSEs. In the case where $d\ll p&lt; +\infty$, the upper-bound $K_2 N^{-1} d^{2-2/p}/ (d+2)^2$ is reached with $K_2$ a constant. Such results lead to dimension-free MSEs of the proposed estimators, which boil down to estimators of the traditional gradient when the variables are independent. Numerical comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Newton-Krylov Methods for Computing Steady States of Particle Timesteppers via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timesteppers constitute a powerful tool in modern computational science and engineering. Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first review the convolution fast-Fourier-transform (CFFT) approach for the numerical solution of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) introduced in (Hyndman and Oyono Ngou, 2017). We then propose a method for improving the boundary errors obtained when valuing options using this approach. We modify the damping and shifting schemes used in the original formulation, which transforms the target function into a bounded periodic function so that Fourier transforms can be applied successfully. Time-dependent shifting reduces boundary error significantly. We present numerical results for our implementation and provide a detailed error analysis showing the improved accuracy and convergence of the modified convolution method.</description>

      <title>The Radon--Nikodym topography of acyclic measured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study locally countable acyclic measure-class-preserving (mcp) Borel graphs by analyzing their "topography" -- the interaction between the geometry and the associated Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.
  At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended.
  Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon--Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.</description>

Abstract: We propose a finite volume stochastic collocation method for the random Euler system. We rigorously prove the convergence of random finite volume solutions under the assumption that the discrete differential quotients remain bounded in probability. Convergence analysis combines results on the convergence of a deterministic FV method with stochastic compactness arguments due to Skorokhod and Gy\"ongy-Krylov.</description>

      <title>Stochastic factors can matter: improving robust growth under ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drifts of asset returns are notoriously difficult to model accurately and, yet, trading strategies obtained from portfolio optimization are very sensitive to them. To mitigate this well-known phenomenon we study robust growth-optimization in a high-dimensional incomplete market under drift uncertainty of the asset price process $X$, under an additional ergodicity assumption, which constrains but does not fully specify the drift in general. The class of admissible models allows $X$ to depend on a multivariate stochastic factor $Y$ and fixes (a) their joint volatility structure, (b) their long-term joint ergodic density and (c) the dynamics of the stochastic factor process $Y$. A principal motivation of this framework comes from pairs trading, where $X$ is the spread process and models with the above characteristics are commonplace. Our main results determine the robust optimal growth rate, construct a worst-case admissible model and characterize the robust growth-optimal strategy via a solution to a certain partial differential equation (PDE). We demonstrate that utilizing the stochastic factor leads to improvement in robust growth complementing the conclusions of the previous study by Itkin et. al. (arXiv:2211.15628 [q-fin.MF], forthcoming in $\textit{Finance and Stochastics}$), which additionally robustified the dynamics of the stochastic factor leading to $Y$-independent optimal strategies. Our analysis leads to new financial insights, quantifying the improvement in growth the investor can achieve by optimally incorporating stochastic factors into their trading decisions. We illustrate our theoretical results on several numerical examples including an application to pairs trading.</description>

      <title>A Pontryagin Maximum Principle on the Belief Space for Continuous-Time Optimal Control with Discrete Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a continuous time stochastic optimal control problem under partial observations that are available only at discrete time instants. This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.
  A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.
  Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system. The scheme uses particle filtering to represent the evolving belief and regression techniques to approximate the adjoint, which yields a practical algorithm for computing near optimal controls under partial information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both linear and nonlinear examples and highlights in particular the benefits of actively controlling the observation process.</description>

      <title>Constrained-degree percolation on the hypercubic lattice: uniqueness and some of its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the constrained-degree percolation (CDP) model on the hypercubic lattice. This is a continuous-time percolation model defined by a sequence $(U_e)_{e\in\mathcal{E}^d}$ of i.i.d. uniform random variables and a positive integer $k$, referred to as the constraint. The model evolves as follows: each edge $e$ attempts to open at a random time $U_e$, independently of all other edges. It succeeds if, at time $U_e$, both of its end-vertices have degrees strictly smaller than $k$. It is known \cite{hartarsky2022weakly} that this model undergoes a phase transition when $d\geq3$ for most nontrivial values of $k$. In this work, we prove that, for any fixed constraint, the number of infinite clusters at any time $t\in[0,1)$ is almost surely either 0 or 1. This uniqueness result implies the continuity of the percolation function in the supercritical regime, $t\in(t_c,1)$, where $t_c$ denotes the percolation critical threshold. The proof relies on a key time-regularity property of the model: the law of the process is continuous with respect to time for local events. In fact, we establish differentiability in time, thereby extending the result of \cite{SSS} to the CDP setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the mean field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) with double mean reflections, whose generator and constraints both depend on the distribution of the solution. When the generator is Lipschitz continuous, based on the backward Skorokhod problem with nonlinear constraints, we investigate the solvability of the doubly mean reflected MFBSDEs by constructing a contraction mapping. Furthermore, if the constraints are linear, the solution can also be constructed by a penalization method. For the case of quadratic growth, we obtain the existence and uniqueness results by using a fixed-point argument, the BMO martingale theory and the {\theta}-method.</description>

      <title>Quenched coalescent for diploid population models with selfing and overlapping generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.</description>

Abstract: We survey classical localization problems arising from quantum network models in symmetry class C and their mappings to history-dependent random walks on directed lattices. We describe how localization versus delocalization of trajectories can be analysed using percolation methods and combinatorial enumeration of path intersection patterns. In particular, we review results establishing almost sure finiteness of trajectories for parameters near criticality and polynomial bounds on the confinement length in cylindrical geometries.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on negative moments of sums of independent Steinhaus random variables (that is uniform on circles in the plane). Together with the series of earlier works: K\"onig-Kwapie\'n (2001), Baernstein II-Culverhouse (2002), and K\"onig (2014), this closes the investigation of sharp $L_p-L_2$ Khinchin-type inequalities for the Steinhaus sums. Incidentally, we fix a mistake in an earlier paper, as well as provide an application to sharp bounds on R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>A semicircle law for the normalized Laplacian of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized Laplacian $\mathcal L$ of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n,p)$. To account for the presence of isolated vertices in the sparse regime, we define $\mathcal L$ using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the degree matrix. Under this convention, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably normalized $\mathcal L$ converges weakly in probability to the semicircle law whenever $np\to\infty$, thereby providing a rigorous justification of a prediction made in (Akara-pipattana and Evnin, 2023). Moreover, if $np&gt;\log n+\omega(1)$, so that $G(n,p)$ has no isolated vertices with high probability, the same conclusion holds for the standard definition of $\mathcal L$. We further strengthen this result to almost sure convergence when $np=\Omega(\log n)$. Finally, we extend our approach to the Chung-Lu random graph model, where we establish a semicircle law for $\mathcal L$ itself, improving upon (Chung, Lu, and Vu 2003), which obtained the semicircle law only for a proxy matrix.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of L\'evy Area for High Order SDE Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well understood that, when numerically simulating SDEs with general noise, achieving a strong convergence rate better than $O(\sqrt{h})$ (where h is the step size) requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion, commonly referred to as its "L\'evy areas". However, these stochastic integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature and for a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion with $d &gt; 2$, no fast almost-exact sampling algorithm is known.
  In this paper, we propose L\'evyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for generating approximate samples of L\'evy area conditional on a Brownian increment. Due to our "Bridge-flipping" operation, the output samples match all joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored GNN-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function based discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism termed "Chen-training", which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results.
  For 4-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that L\'evyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that high-quality synthetic L\'evy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).</description>

      <title>A Rank-Dependent Theory for Decision under Risk and Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper axiomatizes, in a two-stage setup, a new theory for decision under risk and ambiguity. The axiomatized preference relation $\succeq$ on the space $\tilde{V}$ of random variables induces an ambiguity index $c$ on the space $\Delta$ of probabilities, a probability weighting function $\psi$, generating the measure $\nu_{\psi}$ by transforming an objective probability measure, and a utility function $\phi$, such that, for all $\tilde{v},\tilde{u}\in\tilde{V}$, \begin{align*} \tilde{v}\succeq\tilde{u} \Leftrightarrow \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{v}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\} \geq \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{u}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\}. \end{align*} Our theory extends the rank-dependent utility model of Quiggin (1982) for decision under risk to risk and ambiguity, reduces to the variational preferences model when $\psi$ is the identity, and is dual to variational preferences when $\phi$ is affine in the same way as the theory of Yaari (1987) is dual to expected utility. As a special case, we obtain a preference axiomatization of a decision theory that is a rank-dependent generalization of the popular maxmin expected utility theory. We characterize ambiguity aversion in our theory.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrangian Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrangian index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.</description>

Abstract: We consider a multitype Galton-Watson process that allows for the mutation and reversion of individual types in discrete and continuous time. In this setting, we explicitly compute the time evolution of quantities such as the mean and distributions of different types. This allows us in particular to estimate the proportions of different types in the long run, as well as the distribution of the first time of occurrence of a given type as the tree size or time increases. Our approach relies on the recursive computation of the joint distribution of types conditionally to the value of the total progeny. In comparison with the literature on related multitype models, we do not rely on approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to investigate the connection between penalty functions from stochastic optimal control, convex semigroups from analysis and convex expectations from probability theory. Our main result provides a one-to-one relation between these objects. As an application, we use the representation via penality functions and duality arguments to show that convex expectations are determined by their finite dimensional distributions. To illustrate this structural result, we show that Hu and Peng's axiomatic description of $G$-L\'evy processes in terms of finite dimensional distributions extends uniquely to the control approach introduced by Neufeld and Nutz. Finally, we show that convex expectations with a Markovian structure are fully determined by their one-dimensional distributions, which give rise to a classical semigroup on the state space. As an application of this result, we establish a Laplace principle for entropic risk measures associated to controlled diffusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

Abstract: In this note we generalize the results of the recent work by Tom Bohman and Jacob Hofstad on the independence number in G(n, p) to the case of the random k-uniform hypergraph. Concentration in two values occurs in the regime $p&gt;n^{-(k-1)k/(k+1)+\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <title>On The Hidden Biases of Flow Matching Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is generally not a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically not OT-optimal in the Benamou-Brenier sense. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
