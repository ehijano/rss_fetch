      <title>Reconstructing Transition GPDs for Delta(1232) from Helicity Amplitude A_1/2(Q^2) via Dipole Fits and Impact Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular reconstruction of the transition generalized parton distribution (GPD) H_T(x,t) for the Delta(1232) resonance, based on digitized helicity amplitude data and dipole fits to A_1/2(Q^2). From the fitted amplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a separable GPD model H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized Beta-like profile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and enables a direct two-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse spatial distributions q(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates transverse localization, and quantify spatial features using statistical diagnostics including mean radius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is reproducible, data-driven, and applicable to other transition channels, providing a physically interpretable map from amplitude behavior to spatial structure.</description>

      <title>Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection with spiking neural networks for LHC physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection offers a promising strategy for discovering new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper investigates AutoEncoders built using neuromorphic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this purpose. One key application is at the trigger level, where anomaly detection tools could capture signals that would otherwise be discarded by conventional selection cuts. These systems must operate under strict latency and computational constraints. SNNs are inherently well-suited for low-latency, low-memory, real-time inference, particularly on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Further gains are expected with the rapid progress in dedicated neuromorphic hardware development. Using the CMS ADC2021 dataset, we design and evaluate a simple SNN AutoEncoder architecture. Our results show that the SNN AutoEncoders are competitive with conventional AutoEncoders for LHC anomaly detection across all signal models.</description>

      <title>Worldline Modeling of Ultra-Intense Lasers for N-photon Scattering Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of present and future ultra-intense lasers demands techniques that go beyond the standard diagrammatic approach to non-perturbatively fully capture the effects of strong fields. We illustrate the first-quantized path integral representation for strong-field quantum electrodynamics as a means of accessing the laser being treated as a background field, which is treated without recourse to perturbation theory. We examine an all-multiplicity construction for $N-$photon scattering processes for complex scalars and spinors, showing compact Master Formulae for tree-level scattering. Several background fields are considering including: plane waves, impulsive PP-waves, non-null fields, and homogeneous fields (constant-crossed fields) with low-energy external photons.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos at FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the simplest models for the origin of neutrino mass involve right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), which could be either Dirac or Majorana particles - a distinction that has profound implications for lepton number conservation and the fundamental nature of neutrinos. We investigate the potential of the FASER experiment to distinguish between these two possibilities using signatures predicted by the Standard Model Neutrino Effective Field Theory (SMNEFT), where RHNs interact with Standard Model particles through higher-dimensional operators. We focus on RHNs produced via $B$, $D$, $K$, and $\pi$ meson decays at the Large Hadron Collider and their subsequent three-body decays within the FASER detector. The kinematic and angular distributions of the decay products in the RHN rest frame differ significantly for Dirac and Majorana RHNs, and these differences manifest as distinct spatial distributions of electron-positron pairs at FASER. Using Monte Carlo simulations and a $\chi^2$ analysis, we demonstrate that these spatial observables provide a robust experimental probe for determining the Dirac or Majorana nature of RHNs. For select production and decay operator combinations and RHN masses around 0.1 GeV, FASER can achieve discrimination at the $3\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Variational Neural Network Approach to QFT in the Field Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational neural network approach for solving quantum field theories in the field basis, focusing on the free Klein-Gordon model formulated in momentum space. While recent studies have explored neural-network-based variational methods for scalar field theory in position space, a systematic benchmark of the analytically solvable Klein-Gordon ground state -- particularly in the momentum-space field basis -- has been lacking. In this work, we represent the ground-state wavefunctional as a neural network defined on a discretized set of field configurations and train it by minimizing the Hamiltonian expectation value. This framework enables direct comparison to exact analytic results for a range of key observables, including the ground-state energy, two-point correlators, expectation value of the field, and the structure of the learned wavefunctional itself. Our results provide quantitative diagnostics of accuracy and demonstrate the suitability of momentum space for benchmarking neural network approaches, while establishing a foundation for future extensions to interacting models and position-space formulations.</description>

      <title>Analytic Solution for the Helicity Evolution Equations at Small $x$ and Large $N_c\&amp;N_f$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exact analytic solution of the revised small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, where the contributions of the quark-to-gluon and gluon-to-quark transition operators were newly included. These evolution equations are written in the large-$N_c\&amp;N_f$ limit and are double-logarithmic, resumming powers of $\alpha_s\ln^2(1/x)$. Here $N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers of quark colors and flavors, while $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant and $x$ is the Bjorken-$x$ variable. Using our solution, we obtain analytic expressions for the flavor singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) and for the $g_1$ structure function as double-inverse Laplace transforms. We also extract analytic expressions for the four DGLAP polarized anomalous dimensions $\Delta \gamma_{qq}, \Delta \gamma_{qG}, \Delta \gamma_{Gq}$, and $\Delta \gamma_{GG}$: these expressions resum powers of $\alpha_s/\omega^2$ to all orders at large-$N_c\&amp;N_f$ (with $\omega$ the Mellin moment variable). We extract the leading small-$x$ growth of the helicity distributions, \begin{align} \Delta\Sigma(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2)\sim g_1(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{\alpha_h}, \end{align} where the intercept $\alpha_h$ satisfies an algebraic equation. We determine $\alpha_h$ numerically for various values of $N_c$ and $N_f$. We further obtain the explicit asymptotic expressions for the helicity distributions, which yield numerical values for the ratio of the gluon helicity PDF to the flavor singlet quark helicity PDF in the small-$x$ asymptotic limit (for different $N_f/N_c$). We find that all our predictions for polarized DGLAP anomalous dimensions are fully consistent with the existing finite-order calculations. Similar to the large-$N_c$ case, our intercept $\alpha_h$ exhibits a very slight disagreement with the predictions made within the infrared evolution equations framework.</description>

      <title>Neutrino magnetic moment in the doublet-singlet Leptoquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino transition magnetic moment $\mu_{\nu_{\alpha \beta}}$ is studied in a simple extension of the Standard Model. This extension incorporates two scalar Leptoquarks $S_1$ and $\widetilde{R}_2$ with quantum numbers $(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $(3,2,1/6)$ respectively. It is found that these Leptoquarks generate a sizable transition magnetic moment, particularly when the quark bottom is running in the loop. For our analysis of the parameter space, we include the latest measurement of the muon magnetic moment and combine it with the experimental constraint on the branching ratio Br$(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$. We found that, despite the recent agreement on the $(g-2)_\mu$ value, large values for Leptoquark Yukawa couplings are allowed due to a degeneracy in the parameters. Additionally, we explore how the Leptoquark model address the anomalies observed in the ratios of semileptonic $B$ mesons decays, $R_{D^{(*)}}$. We determine that the restrictions derived from our analysis are consistent with the most recent experimental limits reported by the XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN collaborations. This conclusion is based on our evaluation of the transition magnetic moment from muon neutrino to tau neutrino, focusing on the allowed region for the Leptoquark Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Jet Image Generation in High Energy Physics Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational waves from super massive RHNs produced at preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The post-inflationary production of supermassive particles can have profound implications for the thermal history of the universe and may leave observable imprints in the gravitational wave (GW) background. In scenarios where the inflaton couples predominantly to heavy fields, say right-handed neutrino (RHN), non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance can lead to their efficient production, even when their masses exceed the inflaton mass. Once produced, the RHNs emit gravitons through bremsstrahlung as they decay into the Standard Model (SM) particles via $N\rightarrow \ell + H$, enabled by the unavoidable minimal coupling to gravity, sourcing a stochastic GW background. We study this mechanism within the framework of $\alpha-$attractor inflationary models, highlighting how the resulting GW spectrum carries indirect imprints of the heavy sector and the post-inflationary dynamics. This offers an observational window into otherwise inaccessible supermassive particles and provides a powerful probe of high-scale physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs with QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the color-singlet-color-singlet type currents to study the masses and pole residues of charm-strange tetraquark states and their bottom analogs with $J^P$ = $0^+$ and $1^+$ by using two-point QCD sum rules, where the vacuum condensates are considered up to dimension 12. The predicted masses for $DK$, $D^*K$ and $DK^*$ molecular states are $2.322_{ - 0.072}^{ + 0.066}$ GeV, $2.457_{ - 0.068}^{ + 0.064}$ GeV and $2.538_{ - 0.062}^{ + 0.059}$ GeV. These results are consistent well with the experimental data of $D_{s0}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$ and ${D}_{s1}(2536)$, respectively. The theoretical results for $BK$ and $B^*K$ molecular states are $5.970_{ - 0.064}^{ + 0.061}$ GeV and $6.050_{ - 0.064}^{ + 0.062}$ GeV which are all higher than their own thresholds. Finally, the mass of hadronic molecule $BK^*$ is predicted to be $6.158_{ - 0.063}^{ + 0.061}$ GeV. This value is lower than the threshold of $BK^*$, which implies that it may be a bound hadronic molecular state.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <title>Rare few-body decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a survey of rare and exclusive few-body decays of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, defined as those into two to four final particles with branching fractions $\mathcal{B}\lesssim 10^{-5}$. Studies of such decays can be exploited to constrain Yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons, probe flavour-changing Higgs decays, estimate backgrounds for exotic Higgs decays into beyond-SM particles, and/or confirm quantum chromodynamics factorization with small nonperturbative corrections. We collect the theoretical $\mathcal{B}$ values for about 70 unobserved Higgs rare decay channels, indicating their current experimental limits, and estimating their expected bounds in p-p collisions at the HL-LHC. Among those, we include 20 new decay channels computed for the first time for ultrarare Higgs boson decays into photons and/or neutrinos, radiative quark-flavour-changing exclusive decays, and radiative decays into leptonium states. This survey can help guide and prioritize upcoming experimental and theoretical studies of unobserved Higgs boson decays.</description>

      <title>Improved Limits on Exotic Interactions Mediated by Axion-Like Particles Between Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment (AMDM) $a_\mu$ provides an opportunity for constraining the exotic interactions between muons mediated by new scalar or vector particles. Recent progress in both experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the muon AMDM has reconciled the long-standing tension between them. Based on the latest result for the muon AMDM, $\Delta a_\mu =a^{\rm exp}_\mu-a^{\rm SM}_\mu= (38 \pm 63) \times 10^{-11}$, we derive updated constraints on exotic interactions between muons.</description>

      <title>On multi-propagator angular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-propagator angular integrals, a class of phase-space integrals relevant to processes with multiple observed final states and a test-bed for transferring loop-integral technology to phase space integrals without reversed unitarity. We present an Euler integral representation similar to Lee-Pomeransky representation and explicitly describe a recursive IBP reduction and dimensional shift relations for the general case of $n$ denominators. On the level of master integrals, applying a differential equation approach, we explicitly calculate the previously unknown angular integrals with four denominators for any number of masses to finite order in $\varepsilon$. Extending the idea of dimensional recurrence, we explore the decomposition of angular integrals into branch integrals reducing the number of scales in the master integrals from $(n+1)n/2$ to $n+1$. To showcase the potential of this method, we calculate the massless three denominator integral to establish all-order results in $\varepsilon$ including a resummation of soft logarithms.</description>

      <title>The SN 1987A Cooling Bound on Dark Matter Absorption in Electron Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new supernova (SN 1987A) cooling bounds on sub-MeV fermionic dark matter with effective couplings to electrons. These bounds probe the parameter space relevant for direct detection experiments in which dark matter can be absorbed by the target material, showing strong complementarity with indirect searches and constraints from dark matter overproduction. Crucially, our limits exclude the projected sensitivity regions of current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Since these conclusions are a priori not valid for light mediators, we extend our analysis to this case. We show that sub-GeV mediators can be produced resonantly both in supernova cores and in the early Universe, altering the SN 1987A analysis for effective couplings. Still, a combination of supernova cooling constraints and limits from dark matter overproduction excludes the entire parameter space relevant for direct detection in this case.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions at a Muon Collider Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to their broad physics reach enabled by their high energies and precision, future multi-TeV muon colliders will also be the world's most intense sources of neutrinos. This offers the opportunity to search for new non-standard neutrino interactions, possible by installing a dedicated forward neutrino detector in the straight sections of the collision ring, which is then used to measure reactions initiated by neutrinos from the decaying beam muons. In this paper, we show that these searches can exceed current and upcoming bounds on non-standard neutrino interactions from low-energy precision experiments and the LHC. This is achieved by the large flux of high-energetic neutrinos, the precise knowledge of the neutrino flavor composition on each side of the interaction point and the chirality of the neutrinos. We further discuss the technical requirements of the proposed forward neutrino detector, \FASERmuC, to maximally exploit this physics potential.</description>

      <title>Searching for charged Higgs bosons with flavor-changing couplings at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the LHC discovery prospects for charged Higgs bosons in the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) couplings. The FCNH $\rho_{tc}$ coupling induces intriguing $H^+$ production processes $c\bar b \to H^+$, $cg \to bH^+$, and $\bar bg \to \bar cH^+$ without CKM suppression. Sizable $\rho_{tc}$ can drive the disappearance of antimatter from the Universe. In this contribution, we promote the resonant $c\bar b \to H^+$ production, followed by the bosonic $H^+ \to W^+ H$ decay. Discovery could be a harbinger of G2HDM with FCNH couplings, and perhaps shed light on the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Latin American network on electromagnetic effects in strongly interacting matter: Contribution to the update of the Latin American Strategy for High Energy, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate characterization of the quark-gluon plasma requires understanding of how electromagnetic effects affect the processes mediated by the strong force. All the scenarios in which the plasma emerges, either in nature or in the laboratory, involve strong electromagnetic fields. The early universe, compact astrophysical objects, or ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions harbor the most intense fields we know. Researches from the Latin America region have made a substantial contribution on this subject and the \lq\lq Latin American Network on Electromagnetic Effects in Strongly Interacting Matter" aims to cluster efforts to address open questions related to these systems, boosting collaborations and interaction among its members and connecting Latin American institutions with institutions from the rest of the world. In face of the upcoming experimental programs and new facilities, our mission is to bring together experimentalists, phenomenologists and theorists to better explore the properties of strongly interacting matter in the presence of intense electromagnetic fields. This document describes succinctly the recent contributions from researchers of the Latin American region to the subject, as well as our activities and perspectives for the future.</description>

      <title>$\psi(2S)$ production in jets using NRQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on recent data from LHCb, we study $\psi(2S)$ production in jets using non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) in conjunction with the Fragmenting Jet Function (FJF) and Gluon Fragmentation Improved Pythia (GFIP) formalisms. Similar to previous studies of $J/\psi$ production in jets, our results show that these formalisms offer a much better description of data than the default Pythia+NRQCD prediction. We compare and contrast between the predictions from the FJF formalism and the GFIP approach. In addition, our results show that the distribution of $\psi(2S)$ in jets is an excellent discriminator to test different predictions for the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs from various extractions. We find a large disparity between the predictions from three different collaborations showing that a more precise extraction of the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs may be necessary.</description>

      <title>String-based axial and helicity-flip GPDs: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an analytic, string based representation of the nucleon's axial and helicity flip conformal moments of generalized parton distributions that holds for any skewness and for both the quark and gluon channels. The starting point is the Mellin Barnes resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion, where the moments are parametrized by open (Reggeon) and closed string (Pomeron) trajectories with slopes determined by experimental form factors and meson/glueball spectroscopy. The forward limits are fixed by the empirical unpolarized and polarized parton distributions. Polynomiality, crossing symmetry and support are satisfied by construction. After NLO DGLAP ERBL evolution to $\mu=2$ GeV our analytic framework (i) reproduces some of the currently available lattice moments of $\mathbb{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}$ in the non singlet sector, (ii) predicts sea quark and gluon polarized moments that will be testable by forthcoming simulations and experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future EIC, and (iii) yields axial and helicity flip GPDs in $x$ space in reasonable agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Truncation uncertainties for accurate quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The encoding of lattice gauge theories onto quantum computers requires a discretization of the gauge field's Hilbert space on each link, which presents errors with respect to the Kogut--Susskind limit. In the electric basis, Hilbert space fragmentation has recently been shown to limit the excitation of large electric fields. Here, we leverage this to develop a formalism for estimating the size of truncation errors in the electric basis. Generically, the truncation error falls off as a factorial of the field truncation. Examples of this formalism are applied to the Schwinger model and a pure U(1) lattice gauge theory. For reasonable choices of parameters, we improve on previous error estimates by a factor of 10^{306}.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Trajectories calculation with state of the art lattice QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming $\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in $\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest $\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Implication of neutron star observations to the origin of nucleon mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of neutron star observations for understanding the origin of nucleon mass using a framework that combines three complementary approaches: the equation of state based on parity doublet structure for hadronic matter below $2n_0$, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter above $5n_0$, and a model-independent analysis of the intermediate density region based on fundamental physical principles. By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses.</description>

Abstract: We study the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule within a dynamical coupled-channel approach, the J\"ulich-Bonn model for light baryon resonances based on fits to an extensive data base of pion and photon induced data. Recently published photoproduction data for different observables with $\pi N$ and $\eta N$ final states are analyzed simultaneously with older data for the reactions $\pi N\to \pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$, $K\Sigma$ and $\gamma p\to\pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$, $K\Sigma$. The impact of the new data on the resonance spectrum is investigated and the contribution of the individual channels to the GDH integral is determined.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two dimension, and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of high-precision measurements of the $g$ factor of single-electron ions is considered as a detailed probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. The contribution of the exchange of a hypothetical force-carrying scalar boson to the $g$ factor is calculated for the ground state of H-like ions and used to derive bounds on the parameters of that force. Similarly to the isotope shift, we employ the nuclide shift, i.e. the difference for elements with different proton and/or neutron numbers, in order to increase the experimental sensitivity to the new physics contribution. In particular we find, combining available measurements with current precision with different ions, that the coupling constant for the interaction between an electron and a proton can be constrained up to three orders of magnitude better than with the best current atomic data and theory.</description>

      <title>Forward cascade of large-scale primordial magnetic fields during structure formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and radiatively induced terms in dimension-5 non-minimal Lorentz-violating QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the conditions that assure gauge invariance of a non-minimal dimension-5 Lorentz-violating QED. The two and three point functions at one-loop are computed. The gauge Ward identities are checked and the conditions to assure gauge symmetry of this non-minimal framework is found to be the same of the usual QED. Induced terms are also investigated and it is shown that the non-minimal Lorentz-violating $a^{(5)}_F$-term of the fermion sector can induce radiatively a non-minimal Lorentz-violating term in the photon sector.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particle-like dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range 1-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.</description>

      <title>Tri-boson and WH production in the $\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ channel: predictions at full NLO accuracy and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first full NLO predictions for the process $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu\mathrm{e}^+\nu_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ at the LHC in a typical tri-boson phase space. The NLO corrections reach 50% at the level of the fiducial cross section and have a very different hierarchy with respect to vector-boson-scattering phase spaces. By comparing the cross section of the full off-shell process with the sum of contributing on-shell electroweak-boson production subchannels, we find that the process is dominated by WWW and WH production, while vector-boson-scattering topologies still play a non-negligible role. In addition, NLO QCD predictions matched to parton shower which are supplemented by approximate electroweak corrections are provided. For the fiducial cross section, the electroweak corrections turn out to be small but the QCD corrections reach 47%. For the inclusive cross section, matching to parton shower affects the predictions by 7%. However, for differential distributions corrections due to the parton shower can be much more sizeable, depending on the region of phase space.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on Higgs boson self-couplings with quartic and cubic power dependencies of the cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise determination of the Higgs boson self-couplings is essential for understanding the mechanism underlying electroweak symmetry breaking. However, owing to the limited number of Higgs boson pair events at the LHC, only loose constraints have been established to date. Current constraints are based on the assumption that the cross section is a quadratic function of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling within the $\kappa$ framework. Incorporating higher-order quantum corrections from virtual Higgs bosons would significantly alter this functional form, introducing new quartic and cubic power dependencies on the trilinear Higgs self-coupling. To derive this new functional form, we propose a specialized renormalization procedure that tracks all Higgs self-couplings at each calculation step. Additionally, we introduce renormalization constants for coupling modifiers within the $\kappa$ framework to ensure the cancellation of all ultraviolet divergences. With new functional forms of the cross sections in both the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the upper limit of $\kappa_{\lambda_{\rm 3H}}=\lambda_{\rm 3H}/\lambda_{\rm 3H}^{\rm SM}$ set by the ATLAS (CMS) collaboration is reduced from 6.6 (6.49) to 5.5 (5.39). However, extracting a meaningful constraint on the quartic Higgs self-coupling $\lambda_{\rm 4H}$ from Higgs boson pair production data remains challenging. We also present the invariant mass distributions of the Higgs boson pair at different values of $\kappa_{\lambda}$, which could assist in setting optimal cuts for experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixing in SO(10) GUT with a universal two-zero texture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a universal two-zero texture (UTZT) to all mass matrices for matters in their flavour space in SO(10) GUT framework. This texture can be realised by assigning different charge for each family in a $Z_6$ symmetry. By fixing charged fermion masses at their best-fit values, we fit the rest 9 precisely measured observables (three angles and one CP-violating phase in the quark mixing, three angles in the lepton mixing, and two neutrino mass-squared differences) with seven model parameters. The model fits all data of fermion masses and mixing very well and the leptonic CP-violating phase is predicted in the range $(90^\circ, 230^\circ)$. The model further predicts the right-handed neutrino masses, with the lightest and heaviest of order $10^9$ and $10^{12}$ GeV, respectively. Gauge unification and proton decay have been checked with the assumption of a breaking chain with two intermediate symmetries above the electroweak scale. It indicates that $\alpha_{\rm GUT}$ ranges in (0.022,0.032) as long as the assumption of economical choice of Higgs contents, and $M_{\rm GUT}$ should be bigger than $4.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV to meet the Super-K bound. We show effective mass $m_{ee}$ for neutrinoless double beta decay, which provides us with a possibility to test grand unification with neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.</description>

      <title>Clarity through the Neutrino Fog: Constraining New Forces in Dark Matter Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PANDAX-4T and XENONnT experiments present indications of Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) from ${}^{8}$B solar neutrinos at 2.6$\sigma$ and 2.7$\sigma$, respectively. This constitutes the first observation of the neutrino "floor" or "fog", an irreducible background that future dark matter searches in terrestrial detectors will have to contend with. Here, we first discuss the contributions from neutrino-electron scattering and from the Migdal effect in the region of interest of these experiments, and we argue that they are non-negligible. Second, we make use of the recent PANDAX-4T and XENONnT data to derive novel constraints on light scalar and vector mediators coupling to neutrinos and quarks. We demonstrate that these experiments already provide world-leading laboratory constraints on new light mediators in some regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Steering in Neutrino Oscillations with Non-Standard Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the influence of Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) on steering in three-flavor neutrino oscillations, with a focus on the NO$\nu$A and DUNE experimental setups. DUNE, having a longer baseline, exhibits a more pronounced deviation towards NSI in steering compared to NO$\nu$A. Within the energy range where DUNE's maximum flux appears, the steering value for DUNE shows a $21\%$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) to NSI for normal ordering (NO), while for inverted ordering (IO), the steering value increases by approximately $15\%$ relative to the SM. We conduct a comparative analysis of nonlocality, steering, and entanglement. Additionally, we express steering in terms of three-flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities and explore the relationship between steering inequality and concurrence.</description>

      <title>Angular Distribution of Gamma Rays Produced in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of how high-energy proton-proton collisions produce gamma rays through the decays of pions and other secondaries is needed to correctly interpret astrophysical observations with the Fermi-LAT telescope. In the existing literature on cosmic-ray collisions with gas, the focus is on the gamma-ray yield spectrum, $d N_\gamma/dE$. However, in some situations, the joint energy and angular distribution can be observed, so one needs instead $d^2 N_\gamma/dE \, d\Omega$. We provide calculations of this distribution over the energy range from the pion production threshold to $100~{\rm GeV}$, basing our results on FLUKA simulations. We provide the results in tabular form and provide a Python tool on GitHub to aid in utilization. We also provide an approximate analytic formula that illuminates the underlying physics. We discuss simplified examples where this angular dependence can be observed to illustrate the necessity of taking the joint distribution into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological scalar fields coupled to the Standard Model drive temporal variations in the fundamental constants that grow with redshift, positioning the early Universe as a powerful tool to study such models. We investigate the dynamics and phenomenology of coupled scalars from the early Universe to the present to consistently leverage the myriad searches for time-varying constants and the cosmological signatures of scalars' gravitational effects. We compute the in-medium contribution from Standard Model particles to the scalar's dynamics and identify only a limited range of couplings for which the scalar has an observable impact on the fundamental constants without either evolving before recombination or gravitating nonnegligibly. We then extend existing laboratory and astrophysical bounds to the hyperlight scalar regime. We present joint limits from the early and late Universe, specializing to hyperlight, quadratically coupled scalars that modulate the mass of the electron or the strength of electromagnetism and make up a subcomponent of the dark matter today. Our dedicated analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae provides the most stringent constraints on quadratically coupled scalars with masses from $10^{-28.5}$ to $\sim 10^{-31}~\mathrm{eV}$, below which quasar absorption spectra yield stronger bounds. These results jointly limit hyperlight scalars that comprise a few percent of the current dark matter density to near- or subgravitational couplings to electrons or photons.</description>

Abstract: This work provides a proof of concept for the computation of pure gluonic amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The implementation relies on the Berends-Giele recursion algorithm and, for the first time on a GPU, enables the numerical computation of amplitudes in an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions and over finite fields. This demonstrates the advantages of hardware acceleration, not only for the computation of tree-level amplitudes for real-radiation processes in four dimensions over complex numbers but also for generating loop integrands for virtual corrections in $d$ dimensions over finite fields. The associated computer program is publicly available.</description>

      <title>A reanalysis of event shape distributions in electron-positron annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical calculations for event shape observables are often determined by using the conventional scale setting; i.e. the procedure defined by setting the renormalization scale to the center-of-mass energy $\mu_r=\sqrt{s}$ and evaluating theoretical uncertainties by varying the same scale $\mu_r$ in an arbitrary range. Both the event shape distributions and the extracted QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ are plagued by the large renormalization scale uncertainties when using the conventional scale setting. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) provides a rigorous method to eliminate the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities in perturbative QCD predictions. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the event shape observables by applying the PMC method together with the use of the physical $V$-scheme. The PMC scales are not simple single-valued functions, but depend with continuity on the value of the unintegrated event shape variable. This reflects the virtuality of the underlying quark and gluon subprocess and yields to a physical behavior of the scale all over the entire range of each observable. Moreover, the PMC scales in the $V$-scheme exhibits a faster increase compared to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, and a better convergence in the perturbative series can be obtained. Results obtained by the PMC method for the event shape variables, thrust ($T$), heavy jet mass ($\rho=M^2_H/s$), wide jet broadening ($B_W$), total jet broadening ($B_T$), C-parameter ($C$), are in agreement with the high precision experimental data, and for the case of the jet transition variable $Y_3$, we obtain a first improvement in the results to some extent compared with the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently announced the detection of a neutrino with energy 220 PeV. One possible source of such ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. The mass distribution for PBHs features a power-law tail for small masses; a small subset of PBHs would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies ${\cal O} (1 - 10^2) \, {\rm PeV}$, are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory, and identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus. We highlight specific classes of potentials where this correspondence is particularly transparent, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to support stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>Discovering the underlying analytic structure within Standard Model constants using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable expressions obtained with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions to the strong CP problem based on P or CP symmetries are typically framed using the Lagrangian formalism. In this work, we analyze the strong CP phase in QCD from the Hamiltonian perspective, focusing on the invariance of the Hamiltonian H under P (or a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$). For $\mathcal{P}$ to be a physical symmetry, it must preserve the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum (i.e., $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$). This requirement implies that the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} = \theta + \arg \det M$ must vanish, i.e., $\theta$ must cancel the phase of the quark mass matrix $M$. Equivalently, we show that this condition follows from requiring that parity commute with the large gauge transformation operator of QCD.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Trans-Series in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

      <title>Fastest spinning millisecond pulsars: indicators for quark matter in neutron stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a deconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state (EoS) with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector meson and diquark couplings in the quark matter phase, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. As a result, we demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the appearance of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic neutron star (NS) J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration. We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating NSs, obtained based on the assumption that all NSs, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter EoS. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid EoS has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and NSs, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4} \leq 14.90$ km and $R_{0.7}&lt;11.49$ km (considering 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Extensive and Intensive Aspects of Astrophysical Systems and Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Most astrophysical systems in our Universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness $|\Phi| \equiv r_s / R \ll 1$, where $r_{s}$ and $R$ are their Schwarzschild radius and typical size, respectively. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of $|\Phi|$ -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant $G$. It then follows that peak rms values of large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with naturally formed astrophysical systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness $|\Phi|$ is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where $|\Phi|$ is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the Universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of the compactness $|\Phi|$ from $G$ applies specifically to entire, virialized or degeneracy pressure-supported systems, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium between self-gravity and microphysical processes. Finally, we point out that a clear distinction between intensive and extensive astrophysical/cosmological properties could potentially shed a new light on the mass hierarchy and the cosmological constant problems; both may be related to the large complexity of our Universe.
