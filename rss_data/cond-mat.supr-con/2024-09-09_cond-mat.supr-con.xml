      <title>Competition between the modification of intrinsic superconducting properties and the pinning landscape under external pressure in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of low field magnetization, trapped flux magnetization and 5 K flux creep in single crystal of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ under pressure up to 7.5 GPa in a diamond pressure cell are presented. The observed evolution of the temperature dependence of the self-field critical current and slowing down of the base temperature flux creep rate are explained within the two sources of pinning hypothesis involving presence of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ intergrowths suggested in the literature. Above the half collapsed tetragonal structural transition under pressure, where superconductivity is non-bulk or absent, critically diminished or no diamagnetism and flux trapped magnetization were observed.</description>

      <title>O-bridged electron pairing: the microscopic mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the energy level structure of neutral oxygen atom O and its anions, through in-depth analysis of the bonding process and formation mechanism of anion O$^{x-}$ ($1&lt;x\leq{2}$) in oxide superconductors dominated by ionic bonds, we propose an emerging and important novel idea of electron pairing with oxygen atoms as a bridge, different from the previously proposed electronic pairing schemes. This microscopic electronic pairing image is very intuitive and vivid, which can naturally explain the d-wave symmetry of Cooper pairs, large superconducting energy gaps, and small electron-pair sizes in copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. It is the electron-electron pairing mechanism mediated by oxygen atoms that directly determines the unconventional high-temperature superconductivity of cuprates and nickelates.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconducting diode effect in antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal superconductivity, also called as superconducting diode effect that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, is characterized by asymmetric critical currents under opposite applied current directions. This distinct state unveils a rich ore of intriguing physical properties, particularly in the realm of nanoscience application of superconductors. Towards the experimental realization of superconducting diode effect, the construction of two-dimensional heterostructures of magnets and $s$-wave superconductors is considered to be a promising pathway. In this study, we present our findings of superconducting diode effect manifested in the magnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This phenomenon is induced by the proximity effect within a van der Waals heterostructure, consisting of thin $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/NbSe$_2$ flakes. Through transport property measurements, we have confirmed a weak superconducting gap of 0.2 meV, which is significantly lower than the intrinsic gap of NbSe$_2$(1.2 meV). Upon the application of a weak magnetic field below 70 mT, we observed an asymmetry in the critical currents under positive and negative applied currents. This observation demonstrates a typical superconducting diode effect in the superconducting $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance are observed exclusively when the magnetic field is aligned out-of-plane. This suggests that an Ising-type spin-orbit coupling in the superconducting $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ may be responsible for the mechanism. Our findings furnish a platform for the exploration of superconducting diode effect via the artificial construction of heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, topological crystalline insulator and the absence of valence-skipping in AgSnSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent suggestion of valence-skipping phenomenon driving a two-gap superconductivity in $Ag$-doped SnSe, by Kataria, \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B 107, 174517 (2023)], has brought to the fore a long-standing issue once again. The absence of crystallographically inequivalent Sn cites corroborated by electronic properties of AgSnSe$_2$, calculated using first-principles density functional theory, however, does not appear to provide a strong support in favor of valence-skipping in this system. Interestingly, the signature of avoided band-crossings (with the inclusion of SOC) and non-zero \textit{mirror} Chern number ($n_{\mathcal{M}}$) confirm a non-trivial topology. The presence of mirror symmetry-protected surface states along the mirror planes indicates that AgSnSe$_2$ could be a potential candidate for topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Moreover, our calculation of electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic superconducting properties of AgSnSe$_2$, using Migdal-Eliashberg theory, gives a single-gap superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c \approx 7$K, consistent with the experimental value of $5$K. The interplay of topology and superconductivity in this three-dimensional material appears quite intriguing and it may provide new insights into the exploration of superconductivity and topology.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Electronic Ground State of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a superconductivity signature in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under a pressure of 14 GPa, with a superconducting transition temperature of around 80 K, has attracted considerable attention. An important aspect of investigating electronic structures is discerning the extent to which the electronic ground state of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} resembles the parent state of the cuprate superconductor, a charge transfer insulator with long-range antiferromagnetism. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have uncovered the crucial influence of oxygen ligands on the electronic ground states of the Ni ions, displaying a charge transfer nature akin to cuprate but with distinct orbital configurations. Both in-plane and out-of-plane Zhang-Rice singlets associated with Ni d_(x^2-y^2 ) and d_(z^2) orbitals are identified, together with a strong interlayer coupling through inner apical oxygen. Additionally, in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} films, we have detected a superlattice reflection (1/4, 1/4, L) at the Ni L absorption edge using resonant X-ray scattering measurements. Further examination of the resonance profile indicates that the reflection originates from the Ni d orbitals. By evaluating the reflection's azimuthal angle dependence, we have confirmed the presence of collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering and charge-like anisotropy ordered with the same periodicity. Notably, our findings reveal a microscopic relationship between these two components in the temperature dependence of the scattering intensity of the reflection. This investigation enriches our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In the ideal dirty limit, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime reveals the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented in [arXiv:2307.07905v1]. Our analysis remarkably complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Materials with Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this account, we will give an overview of our research progress on novel quantum properties in topological quantum materials with kagome lattice. Here, there are mainly two categories of kagome materials: magnetic kagome materials and nonmagnetic ones. On one hand, magnetic kagome materials mainly focus on the 3d transition-metal-based kagome systems, including Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, YMn6Sn6, FeSn, and CoSn. The interplay between magnetism and topological bands manifests vital influence on the electronic response. For example, the existence of massive Dirac or Weyl fermions near the Fermi level signicantly enhances the magnitude of Berry curvature in momentum space, leading to a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the peculiar frustrated structure of kagome materials enables them to host a topologically protected skyrmion lattice or noncoplaner spin texture, yielding a topological Hall effect that arises from the realspace Berry phase. On the other hand, nonmagnetic kagome materials in the absence of longrange magnetic order include CsV3Sb5 with the coexistence of superconductivity, charge density wave state, and band topology and van der Waals semiconductor Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$. For these two kagome materials, the tunability of electric response in terms of high pressure or carrier doping helps to reveal the interplay between electronic correlation effects and band topology and discover the novel emergent quantum phenomena in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures: dependence on the number of superconducting monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of spin splitting of the local electronic density of states (LDOS). In classical thin-film heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers it has been well studied. However, with the discovery of 2D materials that open up unprecedented opportunities for the design of new functional materials, an intensive study of proximity effects in van der Waals (vdW) S/F heterostructures has begun. In particular, it was shown that in monolayer S/monolayer F heterostructures the physical mechanism of the proximity effect is determined by the hybridization of their electronic states, what makes its observable manifestations completely different from the classical results and allows for effective control over the proximity effect using gate voltage. Here we demonstrate that the hybridization mechanism of the proximity effect clearly manifests itself in the evolution of the magnetic proximity effect in vdW S/F heterostructures with varying number of the superconducting layers. In particular, the number of superconducting layers determines the number of minima in the dependence of the order parameter on the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The spin splitting of the LDOS is very unusual and in general cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field. Physical reasons of such a behavior and possible experimental manifestations are discussed in details.</description>

      <title>Strong local variational approach for superconductivity theory, and the principles of coherent interaction and action-counteraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the two-mode electron pairing, we propose a local stacking force pairing mechanism driven by strong local fluctuations, with two straight pairing orbits where the tying Cooper pairing $C_{-k\downarrow}C_{k\uparrow}e^{ik\cdot r}$ replaces the itinerant pairing. Based on coherent interaction and action-counteraction principles, the strong local variational theory is constructed, with the energy extremum and gap equations forming self-consistent pairs, involving the local variational parameter $\lambda$, energy gap $\Delta$, and the energy cut-off $\hbar \omega_0$. As $\hbar \omega_0(j)$ approaches its cut-off, $\lambda$ and $\Delta$ converge to fixed values. The theory predicts that the coupling strength $Vg(0)$ reduces to $\tilde{V}g(0)=e^{-\left(1-\alpha_{1}\right)^{2} k^{2} / 4 \lambda^{2}} Vg(0)$, and the Cooper pair reduces similarly. For weak coupling, $\alpha_1=1$, and when $Vg(0)=0.1$, $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}}=108 \Delta_{\text{BCS}}$, but $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}}$ decreases to $28 \Delta_{\text{BCS}}$ at $Vg(0)=0.2$. For strong coupling, $\alpha_1=0$, if $Vg(0)=1.4$, $\tilde{V} g(0)$ reduces to 0.2, and the smaller Cooper pair $\widetilde{C_{k \uparrow} C_{-k \downarrow}}$ reduces to $0.14 C_{k \uparrow} C_{-k \downarrow}$. Additionally, $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}} = 0.5676~\text{eV} \gg \hbar \omega_{\text{D}}$, and the local stacking force is $\widetilde{V}_{\text{st}}=0.264 ~\text{eV}$. With $k^2/\lambda^2 =$ const, the local strength increases, causing the stacking force to grow significantly. Thus, $\hbar \omega_0$ and $\Delta$ yield a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Spin freezing induced giant exchange bias in a doped Hund's metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange bias (EB) is a fundamental phenomenon in widespread information technologies. However, a comprehensive understanding of its microscopic origin remains a great challenge. One key issue in the debate is the role of frustration and disorder in the EB mechanism, which motivates the exploration of the EB effect in spin glass (SG) systems. Here,in the SG state of Cr-doped Hund's metal CsFe2As2, we discover a giant EB effect with a maximum bias field of ~ 2 Tesla, which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of traditional alloy SGs. Our results indicate that the giant EB effect should originate from the exchange interactions at the natural boundaries between the tunable ferromagnetic-like (FM) regions around Cr dopants and the SG matrix, via which the FM spins are strongly pinned by the frozen spins in the SG matrix. In addition, the temperature-dependent and cooling-field-dependent EB behaviors could be interpreted well by the SG model with frustrated FM/SG boundaries, which provides an intuitive and explicit understanding of the impact of glassy parameters on the EB effect. All these results suggest that the correlated metals are promising directions for exploring the EB effect in the SG state.</description>

      <title>Pairing tendencies in the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the N\'eel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Weyl superconductivity and quasiperiodic Majorana arcs in quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl superconductivity is a topological phase in three-dimensional crystals in which the Weyl equation describes quasiparticle excitation near band-touching points in momentum space called Weyl nodes. For quasicrystals which lack translational symmetry, a theory of Weyl superconductivity has not been established, in spite of recent extensive studies on quasicrystalline topological phases. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of quasicrystalline Weyl superconductivity by extending the definition of Weyl superconductivity to periodically stacked, two-dimensional superconducting quasicrystals. We identify quasicrystalline Weyl nodes -- topologically protected point nodes in one-dimensional momentum space corresponding to the stacking direction -- in terms of a topological invariant given by a change in the Bott index in quasicrystalline layers. We find that these Weyl nodes exist in pairs and that Majorana zero-energy modes protected by the nonzero Bott index between a pair of quasicrystalline Weyl nodes appear on surfaces. These Majorana zero modes form an infinite number of arcs in momentum space, densely and quasiperiodically distributed as a function of momentum in the direction of surfaces within each quasicrystalline layer. In Ammann-Beenker (Penrose) quasicrystals, the quasiperiodicity of Majorana arcs is governed by the silver (golden) ratio associated with the quasicrystalline structure.</description>

Abstract: The ponderomotive force is an effective static force that a particle feels in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the ponderomotive potential. We generalize this notion to periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient tool to engineer their non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle level. Applied to materials driven by light, the ponderomotive potential is intimately related to the equilibrium optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to resonances. We show that the ponderomotive potential from the incident light may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are presented with experimentally relevant parameters.</description>

Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>

Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>
