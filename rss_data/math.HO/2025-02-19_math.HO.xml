      <title>Eigenvalues in microeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Square matrices often arise in microeconomics, particularly in network models addressing applications from opinion dynamics to platform regulation. Spectral theory provides powerful tools for analyzing their properties. We present an accessible overview of several fundamental applications of spectral methods in microeconomics, focusing especially on the Perron-Frobenius Theorem's role and its connection to centrality measures. Applications include social learning, network games, public goods provision, and market intervention under uncertainty. The exposition assumes minimal social science background, using spectral theory as a unifying mathematical thread to introduce interested readers to some exciting current topics in microeconomic theory.</description>

      <title>Network visualisations related to special functions based on the Scopus data since 1940</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Special functions are essential in theoretical and applied mathematics and have various applications in the applied sciences. Mathematicians have studied them for centuries, but there is still no bibliometric analysis that summarises the datasets of publications showing different network visualisations, such as co-author and keyword visualisations, basic keyword statistics and other data analyses. This work appears to be the first attempt to fill this gap by presenting different network visualisations based on 4025 documents with the keyword "special function" in their title, abstract or keywords belonging to the field of mathematics in the Scopus database. We also show that special functions are rarely used in geometric modelling, a mathematical foundation for CAD, industrial design, architecture, and other applied fields, and we discuss how different visualisations for special functions can be generated in the Julia programming language. The generated image and video visualisations can be helpful to academics to see the impact of different authors, to define their new research topics, to see connections or lack thereof between various topics, to find the most popular special functions, or for teaching purposes to show the importance of special functions and links to other topics in modern pure and applied mathematics and other sciences.</description>
