      <title>Direct Experimental Constraints on the Spatial Extent of a Neutrino Wavepacket</title>

Abstract: Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique system to study quantum coherence and the wavelike nature of particles in fundamental systems due to their extremely weak interaction probabilities. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$, of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC) decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling $^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. The lower limit on the spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter was found to be $\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$\,pm, which implies the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first direct lower limits on the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket were extracted using two different theoretical methods. These results have wide-reaching implications in several areas including the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of hexadecapole collectivity in even-even rare-earth nuclei near $N=90$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of hexadecapole correlations in the rare-earth region near $N=90$ and the effects these correlations have on various nuclear properties, such as the low-energy spectra, as well as quadrupole, hexadecapole, and monopole transition strengths. In order to examine hexadecapole correlations, we employ a mapped $sdg$ interacting boson model, with parameters derived from a self-consistent mean-field calculations with a relativistic energy density functional. We apply this model to even-even isotopes of Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er ($Z=60 - 68$) with neutron numbers $N=84-96$. The obtained results show a good agreement with the experiment. By comparing the results with the ones obtained from a simpler mapped $sd$ interacting boson model, we show that the inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom via $g$ boson is necessary to improve the results of the $J^{\pi} \geq 6^{+}$ yrast energies in the nuclei with $N=84$ and 86, being near the neutron shell closure. The $sdg$ interacting boson model increases the quadrupole transition strengths between yrast states in the $N=90$ and 92 well deformed nuclei, which is in good agreement with the experiment for most of those isotopes. The presence of $g$ bosons does have an important effect on hexadecapole transition strengths, although experimental data for such transitions are limited. The obtained monopole transition strengths do not differ significantly from the ones obtained from the simpler $sd$ model.</description>
