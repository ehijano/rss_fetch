      <title>Efficient MPC-Based Energy Management System for Secure and Cost-Effective Microgrid Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03241v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management systems (EMS) are essential for ensuring optimal, secure, and stable operation in microgrids with high penetrations of distributed energy resources. However, due to the high computational cost for the decision-making, the conventional MPC-based EMS typically adopts a simplified integrated-bus power balance model. While this simplification is effective for small networks, large-scale systems require a more detailed branch flow model to account for the increased impact of grid power losses and security constraints. This work proposes an efficient and reliable MPC-based EMS that incorporates power-loss effects and grid-security constraints. %, while adaptively shaping the battery power profile in response to online renewable inputs, achieving reduced operational costs. It enhances system reliability, reduces operational costs, and shows strong potential for online implementation due to its reduced computational effort. Specifically, a second-order cone program (SOCP) branch flow relaxation is integrated into the constraint set, yielding a convex formulation that guarantees globally optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. Owing to the radial topology of the microgrid, this relaxation is practically tight, ensuring equivalence to the original problem. Building on this foundation, an online demand response (DR) module is designed to further reduce the operation cost through peak shaving. To the best of our knowledge, no prior MPC-EMS framework has simultaneously modeled losses and security constraints while coordinating flexible loads within a unified architecture. The developed framework enables secure operation with effective peak shaving and reduced total cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 10-bus, 18-bus, and 33-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles: Challenges, Gaps, Comprehensive Review, and, Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has redefined the way of transportation by eliminating the need for human intervention in driving. This revolution is fueled by rapid advancements in adaptive cruise control (ACC), which make AVs capable of interpreting their surroundings and responding intelligently. While AVs offer significant advantages, such as enhanced safety and improved traffic efficiency, they also face several challenges that need to be addressed. Existing survey papers often lack a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their potential solutions. Our paper stands out by meticulously identifying these gaps in current ACC research and offering impactful future directions to guide researchers in designing next-generation ACC systems. Our survey provides a detailed and systematic review, addressing the limitations of previous studies and proposing innovative approaches to achieve sustainable and fault-resilient urban transportation.</description>

      <title>On Architectures for Combining Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control with Runtime Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) faces computational demands and performance degradation from model inaccuracies. We propose two architectures combining Neural Network-approximated MPC (NNMPC) with Reinforcement Learning (RL). The first, Warm Start RL, initializes the RL actor with pre-trained NNMPC weights. The second, RLMPC, uses RL to generate corrective residuals for NNMPC outputs. We introduce a downsampling method reducing NNMPC input dimensions while maintaining performance. Evaluated on a rotary inverted pendulum, both architectures demonstrate runtime reductions exceeding 99% compared to traditional MPC while improving tracking performance under model uncertainties, with RL+MPC achieving 11-40% cost reduction depending on reference amplitude.</description>

      <title>Viability-Preserving Passive Torque Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional passivity-based torque controllers for manipulators are typically unconstrained, which can lead to safety violations under external perturbations. In this paper, we employ viability theory to pre-compute safe sets in the state-space of joint positions and velocities. These viable sets, constructed via data-driven and analytical methods for self-collision avoidance, external object collision avoidance and joint-position and joint-velocity limits, provide constraints on joint accelerations and thus joint torques via the robot dynamics. A quadratic programming-based control framework enforces these constraints on a passive controller tracking a dynamical system, ensuring the robot states remain within the safe set in an infinite time horizon. We validate the proposed approach through simulations and hardware experiments on a 7-DoF Franka Emika manipulator. In comparison to a baseline constrained passive controller, our method operates at higher control-loop rates and yields smoother trajectories.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Prediction of Lithium-Ion Battery Power Capability for eVTOL Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have emerged as a promising solution to transform urban transportation. They present a few technical challenges for battery management, a prominent one of which is the prediction of the power capability of their lithium-ion battery systems. The challenge originates from the high C-rate discharging conditions required during eVTOL flights as well as the complexity of lithium-ion batteries' electro-thermal dynamics. This paper, for the first time, formulates a power limit prediction problem for eVTOL which explicitly considers long prediction horizons and the possible occurrence of emergency landings. We then harness machine learning to solve this problem in two intertwined ways. First, we adopt a dynamic model that integrates physics with machine learning to predict a lithium-ion battery's voltage and temperature behaviors with high accuracy. Second, while performing search for the maximum power, we leverage machine learning to predict the remaining discharge time and use the prediction to accelerate the search with fast computation. Our validation results show the effectiveness of the proposed study for eVTOL operations.</description>

      <title>Learning Safety-Compatible Observers for Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach for jointly learning a robust full-state observer and its robustness certificate for systems with unknown dynamics. Leveraging incremental input-to-state stability (delta ISS) notions, we jointly learn a delta ISS Lyapunov function that serves as the robustness certificate and prove practical convergence of the estimation error under standard fidelity assumptions on the learned models. This renders the observer safety-compatible: they can be consumed by certificate-based safe controllers so that, when the controller tolerates bounded estimation error, the controller's certificate remains valid under output feedback. We further extend the approach to interconnected systems via the small-gain theorem, yielding a distributed observer design framework. We validate the approach on a variety of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Cyber Resilience of Three-phase Unbalanced Distribution System Restoration under Sparse Adversarial Attack on Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System restoration is critical for power system resilience, nonetheless, its growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI)-based load forecasting introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to infeasible planning, voltage and frequency violations, and unsuccessful recovery of de-energized segments, yet the resilience of restoration processes to such attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying how adversarially manipulated forecasts impact restoration feasibility and grid security. We develop a gradient-based sparse adversarial attack that strategically perturbs the most influential spatiotemporal inputs, exposing vulnerabilities in forecasting models while maintaining stealth. We further create a restoration-aware validation framework that embeds these compromised forecasts into a sequential restoration model and evaluates operational feasibility using an unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow formulation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more efficient and stealthier than baseline attacks. It reveals system-level failures, such as voltage and power ramping violations that prevent the restoration of critical loads. These findings provide actionable insights for designing cybersecurity-aware restoration planning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Energy Management in Indoor Farming Using Lighting Flexibility and Intelligent Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor farming enables year-round food production but its reliance on artificial lighting significantly increases energy consumption, peak load charges, and energy costs for growers. Recent studies indicate that plants are able to tolerate interruptions in light, enabling the design of 24-hour lighting schedules (or "recipes") with strategic light modulation in alignment with day-ahead pricing. Thus, we propose an optimal lighting control strategy for indoor farming that modulates light intensity and photoperiod to reduce energy costs. The control strategy is implemented within a model predictive control framework and augmented with transformer-based neural networks to forecast 24-hour ahead solar radiation and electricity prices to improve energy cost reduction. The control strategy is informed by real-world experimentation on lettuce crops to discover minimum light exposure and appropriate dark-light intervals, which are mathematically formulated as constraints to maintain plant health. Simulations for a one-hectare greenhouse, based on real electricity market data from Ontario, demonstrate an annual cost reduction of $318,400 (20.9%), a peak load decrease of 1.6 MW (33.32%), and total energy savings of 1890 MWh (20.2%) against a baseline recipe. These findings highlight the potential of intelligent lighting control to improve the sustainability and economic feasibility of indoor farming.</description>

      <title>On the Duality Between Quantized Time and States in Dynamic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a formal duality between discrete-time and quantized-state numerical methods. We interpret quantized state system (QSS) methods as integration schemes applied to a dual form of the system model, where time is seen as a state-dependent variable. This perspective enables the definition of novel QSS-based schemes inspired by classical time-integration techniques. As a proof of concept, we illustrate the idea by introducing a QSS Adams-Bashforth method applied to a test equation. We then move to demonstrate how the proposed approach can achieve notable performance improvements in realistic power system simulations.</description>

      <title>A Trustworthy Industrial Fault Diagnosis Architecture Integrating Probabilistic Models and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are limitations of traditional methods and deep learning methods in terms of interpretability, generalization, and quantification of uncertainty in industrial fault diagnosis, and there are core problems of insufficient credibility in industrial fault diagnosis. The architecture performs preliminary analysis through a Bayesian network-based diagnostic engine and features an LLM-driven cognitive quorum module with multimodal input capabilities. The module conducts expert-level arbitration of initial diagnoses by analyzing structured features and diagnostic charts, prioritizing final decisions after conflicts are identified. To ensure the reliability of the system output, the architecture integrates a confidence calibration module based on temperature calibration and a risk assessment module, which objectively quantifies the reliability of the system using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE). Experimental results on a dataset containing multiple fault types showed that the proposed framework improved diagnostic accuracy by more than 28 percentage points compared to the baseline model, while the calibrated ECE was reduced by more than 75%. Case studies have confirmed that HCAA effectively corrects misjudgments caused by complex feature patterns or knowledge gaps in traditional models, providing novel and practical engineering solutions for building high-trust, explainable AI diagnostic systems for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data Center Low-Voltage Ride-Through</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data center loads have expanded significantly in recent years. Compared to traditional loads, data centers are highly sensitive to voltage deviations and thus their protection mechanisms trip more proactively during voltage fluctuations. During a grid fault, simultaneous tripping of large-scale data centers can further destabilize the transmission system and even lead to cascading failures. In response, transmission system operators are imposing voltage ride-through (VRT) requirements for data centers. In this work, we enhance the VRT capability of data centers by designing voltage controllers for their internal power distribution network. We first systematically analyze VRT standards and the controllable resources related to data centers. These resources enable the design of voltage control strategies to regulate voltages internal to the data center, thereby allowing loads to remain online during voltage disturbances from the external transmission grid. We study and contrast both centralized and decentralized controllers that unify the control of heterogeneous flexible resources. Additionally, we construct an integrated test system that simulates both the transient fault response of the transmission system and the data center distribution network. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed voltage control mechanisms provide effective yet simple solutions to enhance data center low-voltage ride-through capability.</description>

      <title>Electrical System Architecture for Aviation Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03887v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of aircraft is reshaping the foundations of aerospace design by positioning electrical systems at the center of propulsion, control, and onboard functionality. This chapter provides an overview of electrical system architectures for electric and hybrid electric aircraft, highlighting both established principles and emerging design strategies. The discussion begins with the motivations for electrification, including reducing environmental impact, improving operational efficiency, and replacing complex pneumatic and hydraulic subsystems with lighter and more reliable electrical alternatives. Aircraft electrical architectures are classified into four major categories: conventional, more electric, all electric, and hybrid electric. A range of system topologies is examined, including direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), hybrid, and distributed configurations. Each is considered in terms of its effectiveness in delivering power, enabling redundancy, supporting fault isolation, and managing thermal performance. Real world examples are presented to demonstrate practical applications, with case studies drawn from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Eviation Alice commuter aircraft, and NASA X57 Maxwell demonstrator. These examples illustrate the ongoing transition from incremental subsystem electrification toward fully integrated architectures that promise higher efficiency and greater sustainability.</description>

      <title>3D Electronic-Photonic Heterogenous Interconnect Platforms Enabling Energy-Efficient Scalable Architectures For Future HPC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D interconnects have emerged as a solution to address the scaling issues of interconnect bandwidth and the memory wall problem in high-performance computing (HPC), such as High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). However, the copper-based electrical interconnect retains fundamental limitations. Dense I/O for high-speed signals lead to degraded signal quality for end-to-end links, necessitating additional circuits to mitigate signal impairments and resulting in poor energy efficiency. We propose a 3D chiplet stacking electronic-photonic interconnect (EPIC) platform, which offers a solution by moving the high-speed data communication interface to the optical domain across the 3D stack by using Through Silicon Optical Vias (TSOV), while retaining the functionality of electrical TSVs and 2.5D interconnects for power delivery and short-reach low-latency communications. We then benchmark the proposed model against state-of-the-art 3D electrical interconnects to demonstrate our 3D EPIC platform beating the 3D electrical interconnects to $&gt;$10 TB/s/$mm^2$ bandwidth density. We present a pathway to extend our demonstrated, industry-ready design to achieving $\leq$100 fJ/bit high-speed communication.</description>

      <title>Use of Quadcopter Wakes to Supplement Strawberry Pollination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pollinators are critical to the world's ecosystems and food supply, yet recent studies have found pollination shortfalls in several crops, including strawberry. This is troubling because wild and managed pollinators are currently experiencing declines. One possibility is to try and provide supplemental pollination solutions. These solutions should be affordable and simple for farmers to implement if their use is to be widespread; quadcopters are a great example, already used for monitoring on many farms. This paper investigates a new method for artificial pollination based on wind pollination that bears further investigation. After determining the height where the lateral flow is maximized, we performed field experiments with a quadcopter assisting natural pollinators. Although our results in the field were inconclusive, lab studies show that the idea shows promise and could be adapted for better field results.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Practical Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems via Chain Policies: Sample Complexity and Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for data-driven practical stabilization of nonlinear systems with provable guarantees, based on the concept of Nonparametric Chain Policies (NCPs). The approach employs a normalized nearest-neighbor rule to assign, at each state, a finite-duration control signal derived from stored data, after which the process repeats. Unlike recent works that model the system as linear, polynomial, or polynomial fraction, we only assume the system to be locally Lipschitz. Our analysis builds on the framework of Recurrent Lyapunov Functions (RLFs), which enable data-driven certification of practical stability using standard norm functions instead of requiring the explicit construction of a classical Lyapunov function. To extend this framework, we introduce the concept of Recurrent Control Lyapunov Functions (R-CLFs), which can certify the existence of an NCP that practically stabilizes an arbitrarily small c-neighborhood of an equilibrium point. We also provide an explicit sample complexity guarantee of O((3/rho)^d log(R/c)) number of trajectories, where R is the domain radius, d the state dimension, and rho a system-dependent constant. The proposed Chain Policies are nonparametric, thus allowing new verified data to be readily incorporated into the policy to either improve convergence rate or enlarge the certified region. Numerical experiments illustrate and validate these properties.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC-based Coordination of Traffic Perimeter and Signal Control: A Lexicographic Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Prediction-Based Chance-Constrained Programming Approach for 24/7 Carbon-Free Data Center Operation Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI applications is dramatically increasing data center energy demand, exacerbating carbon emissions, and necessitating a shift towards 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE). Unlike traditional annual energy matching, 24/7 CFE requires matching real-time electricity consumption with clean energy generation every hour, presenting significant challenges due to the inherent variability and forecasting errors of renewable energy sources. Traditional robust and data-driven optimization methods often fail to leverage the features of the prediction model (also known as contextual or covariate information) when constructing the uncertainty set, leading to overly conservative operational decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for 24/7 CFE data center operation scheduling, focusing on robust decision-making under renewable generation uncertainty. This framework leverages covariate information through a multi-variable conformal prediction (CP) technique to construct statistically valid and adaptive uncertainty sets for renewable forecasts. The uncertainty sets directly inform the chance-constrained programming (CCP) problem, ensuring that chance constraints are met with a specified probability. We further establish theoretical underpinnings connecting the CP-generated uncertainty sets to the statistical feasibility guarantees of the CCP. Numerical results highlight the benefits of this covariate-aware approach, demonstrating up to 6.65% cost reduction and 6.96% decrease in carbon-based energy usage compared to conventional covariate-independent methods, thereby enabling data centers to progress toward 24/7 CEF.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion-based Generative Machine Learning Paradigm for Contingency Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contingency screening is a crucial part of electric power systems all the time. Power systems frequently encounter multiple challenging operational dilemmas that could lead to the instability of power systems. Contingency analysis is effort-consuming by utilizing traditional numerical analysis methods. It is commonly addressed by generating a whopping number of possible contingencies or manipulating network parameters to determine the worst scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach that diverts the nature of contingency analysis from pre-defined scenario screening to proactive-unsupervised screening. The potentially risky scenarios of power systems are generated from learning how the previous ones occurred. In other words, the internal perturbation that initiates contingencies is learned prior to being self-replicated for rendering the worst scenarios. By leveraging the perturbation diffusion technique, a proposed model is built to point out the worst scenarios instead of repeatedly simulating one-by-one scenarios to define the highest-risk ones. Empirical experiments are implemented on the IEEE systems to test and validate the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>On properties of hydraulic equilibria in district heating networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: District heating networks are an integral part of the energy system in many countries. In future smart energy systems, they are expected to enhance energy flexibility and support the integration of renewable and waste energy sources. An important aspect of these networks is the control of flow rates, which dictates the heat delivered to consumers. This paper concerns the properties of flow rates in tree-structured district heating networks. We show that under mild assumptions of monotonicity in the hydraulic network components, statements regarding the stationary flow rate distribution can be made. In particular, when all consumers in a network incrementally open their valves, an increase in total flow rate throughput is guaranteed, while if one consumer does not open their valve when others do, they will receive a reduced flow rate. These properties are illustrated numerically on a small 2-consumer network as well as on a larger 22-consumer network. Previous works have shown that these properties allow the design and use of efficient control strategies for optimal heat distribution.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Adaptive PID Control Based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven PID controller design based on the principle of adaptive gain optimization, leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) generated for predictive modeling purposes. The proposed control design method utilizes gradients of the PID gain optimization, achieved through the automatic differentiation of PINNs, to apply model predictive control using a cost function based on tracking error and control inputs. By optimizing PINNs-based PID gains, the method achieves adaptive gain tuning that ensures stability while accounting for system nonlinearities. The proposed method features a systematic framework for integrating PINNs-based models of dynamical control systems into closed-loop control systems, enabling direct application to PID control design. A series of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from the control perspectives based on both time and frequency domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines the design vision and planned evolution of Blexer v3, a modular and AI-driven rehabilitation ecosystem based on serious games. Building on insights from previous versions of the system, we propose a new architecture that aims to integrate multimodal sensing, real-time reasoning, and intelligent control. The envisioned system will include distinct modules for data collection, user state inference, and gameplay adaptation. Key features such as dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) and procedural content generation (PCG) are also considered to support personalized interventions. We present the complete conceptual framework of Blexer v3, which defines the modular structure and data flow of the system. This serves as the foundation for the next phase: the development of a functional prototype and its integration into clinical rehabilitation scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Prediction-Based Properties of Discrete-Event Systems: Notions, Applications and Supervisor Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of synthesizing property-enforcing supervisors for partially-observed discrete-event systems (DES). Unlike most existing approaches, where the enforced property depends solely on the executed behavior of the system, here we consider a more challenging scenario in which the property relies on predicted future behaviors that have not yet occurred. This problem arises naturally in applications involving future information, such as active prediction or intention protection. To formalize the problem, we introduce the notion of prediction-based properties, a new class of observational properties tied to the system's future information. We demonstrate that this notion is very generic and can model various practical properties, including predictability in fault prognosis and pre-opacity in intention security. We then present an effective approach for synthesizing supervisors that enforce prediction-based properties. Our method relies on a novel information structure that addresses the fundamental challenge arising from the dependency between current predictions and the control policy. The key idea is to first borrow information from future instants and then ensure information consistency. This reduces the supervisor synthesis problem to a safety game in the information space. We prove that the proposed algorithm is both sound and complete, and the resulting supervisor is maximally permissive.</description>

      <title>Learning a Shape-adaptive Assist-as-needed Rehabilitation Policy from Therapist-informed Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing corrective force and improving movement smoothness.</description>

      <title>MPC strategies for density profile control with pellet fueling in nuclear fusion tokamaks under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of the density profile based on pellet fueling for the ITER nuclear fusion tokamak involves a multi-rate nonlinear system with safety-critical constraints, input delays, and discrete actuators with parametric uncertainty. To address this challenging problem, we propose a multi-stage MPC (msMPC) approach to handle uncertainty in the presence of mixed-integer inputs. While the scenario tree of msMPC accounts for uncertainty, it also adds complexity to an already computationally intensive mixed-integer MPC (MI-MPC) problem. To achieve real-time density profile controller with discrete pellets and uncertainty handling, we systematically reduce the problem complexity by (1) reducing the identified prediction model size through dynamic mode decomposition with control, (2) applying principal component analysis to reduce the number of scenarios needed to capture the parametric uncertainty in msMPC, and (3) utilizing the penalty term homotopy for MPC (PTH-MPC) algorithm to reduce the computational burden caused by the presence of mixed-integer inputs. We compare the performance and safety of the msMPC strategy against a nominal MI-MPC in plant simulations, demonstrating the first predictive density control strategy with uncertainty handling, viable for real-time pellet fueling in ITER.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Planning with Maximum-Coverage Distributionally Robust Backward Reachable Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new multi-query motion planning algorithm for linear Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a Euclidean ball with high probability. We develop a new formulation for ball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions and leverage it to develop a distributionally robust belief roadmap construction algorithm. This algorithm synthe- sizes robust controllers which are certified to be safe for maximal size ball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions. Our algorithm achieves better coverage than the maximal coverage algorithm for planning over Gaussian distributions [1], and we identify mild conditions under which our algorithm achieves strictly better coverage. For the special case of no process noise or state constraints, we formally prove that our algorithm achieves maximal coverage. In addition, we present a second multi-query motion planning algorithm for linear Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a region parameterized by the Minkowski sum of an ellipsoid and a Euclidean ball with high probability. This algorithm plans over ellipsoidal sets of maximal size ball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions, and provably achieves equal or better coverage than the best-known algorithm for planning over ellipsoidal ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions [2]. We demonstrate the efficacy of both methods in a wide range of conditions via extensive simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an event-triggered moving horizon estimation (ET-MHE) scheme for the remote state estimation of general nonlinear systems. In the presented method, whenever an event is triggered, a single measurement is transmitted and the nonlinear MHE optimization problem is subsequently solved. If no event is triggered, the current state estimate is updated using an open-loop prediction based on the system dynamics. Moreover, we introduce a novel event-triggering rule under which we demonstrate robust global exponential stability of the ET-MHE scheme, assuming a suitable detectability condition is met. In addition, we show that with the adoption of a varying horizon length, a tighter bound on the estimation error can be achieved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Power Reserve Capacity from Virtual Power Plants with Reliability and Cost Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources is expected to drive higher demand for power reserve ancillary services (AS). One solution is to increase the supply by integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into the AS market through virtual power plants (VPPs). Several methods have been developed to assess the potential of VPPs to provide services. However, the existing approaches fail to account for AS products' requirements (reliability and technical specifications) and to provide accurate cost estimations. Here, we propose a new method to assess VPPs' potential to deliver power reserve capacity products under forecasting uncertainty. First, the maximum feasible reserve quantity is determined using a novel formulation of subset simulation for efficient uncertainty quantification. Second, the supply curve is characterized by considering explicit and opportunity costs. The method is applied to a VPP based on a representative Swiss low-voltage network with a diversified DER portfolio. We find that VPPs can reliably offer reserve products and that opportunity costs drive product pricing. Additionally, we show that the product's requirements strongly impact the reserve capacity provision capability. This approach aims to support VPP managers in developing market strategies and policymakers in designing DER-focused AS products.</description>

      <title>An Active Fault-Tolerant Online Control Allocation Scheme for a Dual-System UAV in Transition Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) scheme for a dual-system vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during transition flight is proposed in this paper. The AFTC scheme is composed of a baseline control law and an online control reallocation module. First, the structured $H_{\infty}$ baseline control law is able to guarantee the stability of closed-loop systems without being reconfigured under simultaneous actuator fault conditions. Second, compared to the existing mainstream method of sliding mode control that is a discontinuous control strategy, the AFTC scheme can effectively avoid control chattering problem by adopting the structured $H_{\infty}$ baseline control law. Third, an online control allocation (CA) module is implemented to carry out a unified CA for all the available actuators. When actuator faults/failures occur, the CA matrix is updated according to fault information and real-time airspeed, which is able to redistribute the virtual control signals to the remaining healthy actuators, avoiding significant performance degradation. Based on the developed AFTC scheme, symmetric and non-symmetric actuator fault scenarios are simulated on a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulator, where the cases of merely structured $H_{\infty}$ control and structured $H_{\infty}$ based AFTC are compared and analyzed. The results show that the proposed structured $H_{\infty}$ based AFTC system is capable of handling more complicated fault scenarios and model uncertainties with no need to reconfigure the baseline control law. The proposed AFTC scheme significantly improves the safety and reliability of the transition flight of dual-system VTOL UAVs.</description>

Abstract: In Europe, profit-seeking balance responsible parties can deviate in real time from their day-ahead nominations to assist transmission system operators in maintaining the supply-demand balance. Model predictive control (MPC) strategies to exploit these implicit balancing strategies capture arbitrage opportunities, but fail to accurately capture the price-formation process in the European imbalance markets and face high computational costs. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods are fast to execute, but require data-intensive training and usually rely on real-time and historical data for decision-making. This paper proposes an MPC-guided RL method that combines the complementary strengths of both MPC and RL. The proposed method can effectively incorporate forecasts into the decision-making process (as in MPC), while maintaining the fast inference capability of RL. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the implicit balancing battery control problem using Belgian balancing data from 2023. First, we analyze the performance of the standalone state-of-the-art RL and MPC methods from various angles, to highlight their individual strengths and limitations. Next, we show an arbitrage profit benefit of the proposed MPC-guided RL method of 16.15% and 54.36%, compared to standalone RL and MPC.</description>

      <title>Robust Cislunar Navigation via LFT-Based $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Filtering with Bearing-Only Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a robust estimation framework for cislunar navigation that embeds the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) dynamics and bearing-only optical measurements within a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) representation. A full-order $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer is synthesized with explicit $\mathcal{L}_2$ performance bounds. The formulation yields a nonlinear estimator that operates directly on the governing equations and avoids reliance on local linearizations. Dominant nonlinearities are expressed as structured real uncertainties, while measurement fidelity is represented through range-dependent weighting with Earth-Moon distances reconstructed from line-of-sight geometry. The sensing architecture assumes passive star-tracker-class optical instruments, eliminating the need for time-of-flight ranging or precision clocks. Simulations demonstrate bounded estimation errors and smooth position tracking over multiple orbital periods, with the largest deviations observed in the out-of-plane states, consistent with the stiffness of the vertical dynamics and the limitations of angle-only observability. Application to a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) illustrates that the framework can achieve robust onboard navigation with bounded estimation errors with flight-representative sensors.</description>

      <title>Multi-Loop Design of Virtual Synchronous Machine Control for DFIG-Based Wind Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The displacement of synchronous generators by converter-interfaced renewable energy sources obliges wind farms to provide inertia, damping, and voltage support, above all in increasingly weak grid conditions. This paper presents a co-ordinated frequency-domain methodology for tuning all control layers of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) within a wind farm operated as a Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM). Starting from a full small-signal linearisation that preserves loop-to-loop and machine-to-machine couplings, the procedure reshapes every local open loop to explicit phase-margin targets through a single, prioritised iteration. The resulting controllers provide a step response and stability margins close to those programmed at the design stage, in spite of the cross coupling between control loops. Since controller synthesis relies exclusively on classical loop-shaping tools available in commercial simulation suites, it is readily applicable to industrial-scale projects.</description>

      <title>Efficient Input-Constrained Impulsive Optimal Control of Linear Systems with Application to Spacecraft Relative Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel algorithm for impulsive optimal control of linear time-varying systems with the inclusion of input magnitude constraints. Impulsive optimal control problems, where the optimal input solution is a sum of delta functions, are typically formulated as an optimization over a normed function space subject to integral equality constraints and can be efficiently solved for linear time-varying systems in their dual formulation. In this dual setting, the problem takes the form of a semi-infinite program which is readily solvable in online scenarios for constructing maneuver plans. This work augments the approach with the inclusion of magnitude constraints on the input over time windows of interest, which is shown to preserve the impulsive nature of the optimal solution and enable efficient solution procedures via semi-infinite programming. The resulting algorithm is demonstrated on the highly relevant problem of relative motion control of spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and compared to several other proposed solutions from the literature.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ground Station Selection for Large LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective ground station selection is critical for low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite constellations to minimize operational costs, maximize data downlink volume, and reduce communication gaps between access windows. Traditional ground station selection typically begins by choosing from a fixed set of locations offered by Ground Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers, which helps reduce the problem scope to optimizing locations over existing infrastructure. However, finding a globally optimal solution for stations using existing mixed-integer programming methods quickly becomes intractable at scale, especially when considering multiple providers and large satellite constellations. To address this issue, we introduce a scalable, hierarchical framework that decomposes the global selection problem into single-satellite, short time-window subproblems. Optimal station choices from each subproblem are clustered to identify consistently high-value locations across all decomposed cases. Cluster-level sets are then matched back to the closest GSaaS candidate sites to produce a globally feasible solution. This approach enables scalable coordination while maintaining near-optimal performance. We evaluate our method's performance on synthetic Walker-Star test cases (1-10 satellites, 1-10 stations), achieving solutions within 95% of the global IP optimum for all test cases. Real-world evaluations on Capella Space (5 satellites), ICEYE (40), and Planet's Flock (96) show that while exact IP solutions fail to scale, our framework continues to deliver high-quality site selections.</description>

      <title>Cooling Under Convexity: An Inventory Control Perspective on Industrial Refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial refrigeration systems have substantial energy needs, but optimizing their operation remains challenging due to the tension between minimizing energy costs and meeting strict cooling requirements. Load shifting--strategic overcooling in anticipation of future demands--offers substantial efficiency gains. This work seeks to rigorously quantify these potential savings through the derivation of optimal load shifting policies. Our first contribution establishes a novel connection between industrial refrigeration and inventory control problems with convex ordering costs, where the convexity arises from the relationship between energy consumption and cooling capacity. Leveraging this formulation, we derive three main theoretical results: (1) an optimal algorithm for deterministic demand scenarios, along with proof that optimal trajectories are non-increasing (a valuable structural insight for practical control); (2) performance bounds that quantify the value of load shifting as a function of cost convexity, demand variability, and temporal patterns; (3) a computationally tractable load shifting heuristic with provable near-optimal performance under uncertainty. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings, and a case study using real industrial refrigeration data demonstrates an opportunity for improved load shifting.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Quadratic Programming Perspective on Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a unified perspective on different approaches to the solution of optimal control problems through the lens of constrained sequential quadratic programming. In particular, it allows us to find the relationships between Newton's method, the iterative LQR (iLQR), and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) approaches to solve the problem. It is shown that the iLQR is a principled SQP approach, rather than simply an approximation of DDP by neglecting the Hessian terms, to solve optimal control problems that can be guaranteed to always produce a cost-descent direction and converge to an optimum; while Newton's approach or DDP do not have similar guarantees, especially far from an optimum. Our empirical evaluations on the pendulum and cart-pole swing-up tasks serve to corroborate the SQP-based analysis proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Robust Permissive Controller Synthesis for Interval MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of robust permissive controller synthesis for robots operating under uncertain dynamics, modeled as Interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs). IMDPs generalize standard MDPs by allowing transition probabilities to vary within intervals, capturing epistemic uncertainty from sensing noise, actuation imprecision, and coarse system abstractions-common in robotics. Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single deterministic strategy, limiting adaptability. In contrast, permissive controllers (multi-strategies) allow multiple actions per state, enabling runtime flexibility and resilience. However, prior work on permissive controller synthesis generally assumes exact transition probabilities, which is unrealistic in many robotic applications. We present the first framework for robust permissive controller synthesis on IMDPs, guaranteeing that all strategies compliant with the synthesized multi-strategy satisfy reachability or reward-based specifications under all admissible transitions. We formulate the problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings: a baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that avoids explicit enumeration. Experiments on four benchmark domains show that both methods synthesize robust, maximally permissive controllers and scale to large IMDPs with up to hundreds of thousands of states.</description>

      <title>CANOPI: Contingency-Aware Nodal Optimal Power Investments with High Temporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CANOPI, a novel algorithmic framework, for solving the Contingency-Aware Nodal Power Investments problem, a large-scale nonlinear optimization problem that jointly optimizes generation, storage, and transmission expansion. The underlying problem is nonlinear due to the impact of transmission upgrades on impedances, and the problem's large scale arises from the confluence of spatial and temporal resolutions. We propose algorithmic approaches to address these computational challenges. We pose a linear approximation of the overall nonlinear model, and develop a fixed-point algorithm to adjust for the nonlinear impedance feedback effect. We solve the large-scale linear expansion model with a specialized level-bundle method leveraging a novel interleaved approach to contingency constraint generation. We introduce a minimal cycle basis algorithm that improves the numerical sparsity of cycle-based DC power flow formulations, accelerating solve times for the operational subproblems. CANOPI is demonstrated on a 1493-bus Western Interconnection test system built from realistic-geography network data, with hourly operations spanning 52 week-long scenarios and a total possible set of 20 billion individual transmission contingency constraints. Numerical results quantify the reliability and economic benefits of fully incorporating transmission contingencies in integrated planning models and highlight the computational advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Safe RLHF: Fixed-Penalty Constraint Optimization for Safer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models (LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Graph Neural Network Models for Distribution Grid Fault Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous vehicles necessitates advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a bi-level control framework that efficiently augments road boundaries by incorporating time-dependent grid projections of obstacle movements, thus enabling precise and adaptive path planning. The main control loop utilizes Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for real-time path optimization, wherein homotopy-based constraint relaxation is employed to improve the solvability of the optimal control problem (OCP). Furthermore, an independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Optimising Battery Energy Storage System Trading via Energy Market Operator Price Forecast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electricity markets around the world, the ability to anticipate price movements with precision can be the difference between profit and loss, especially for fast-acting assets like battery energy storage systems (BESS). As grid volatility increases due to renewables and market decentralisation, operators and forecasters alike face growing pressure to transform prediction into strategy. Yet while forecast data is abundant, especially in advanced markets like Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), its practical value in driving real-world BESS trading decisions remains largely unexplored. This thesis dives into that gap. This work addresses a key research question: Can the accuracy of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) energy price forecasts be systematically leveraged to develop a reliable and profitable battery energy storage system trading algorithm? Despite the availability of AEMO price forecasts, no existing framework evaluates their reliability or incorporates them into practical BESS trading strategies. By analysing patterns in forecast accuracy based on time of day, forecast horizon, and regional variations, this project creates a novel, forecast-informed BESS trading model to optimise arbitrage financial returns. The performance of this forecast-driven algorithm is benchmarked against a basic trading algorithm with no knowledge of forecast data. The study further explores the potential of machine learning techniques to predict future energy prices by enhancing AEMO forecasts to govern a more advanced trading strategy. The research outcomes will inform future improvements in energy market trading models and promote more efficient BESS integration into market operations.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.</description>

      <title>HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a model-predictive controller for managing the actuators in sewer networks. It minimizes flooding and combined-sewer overflow during rain and pollution at other times. To make the problem tractable, we use a convex relaxation of the microbial growth kinetics and a physically motivated linearization of the mass flow bilinearities. With these approximations, the trajectory optimization in each control period is a second-order cone program. In simulation, the controller releases roughly 15% less pollutant mass than a conventional controller while treating nearly the same volume of flow. It does so by better balancing the flow over the treatment plants and over time.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Framework for Intermediate Map Construction and Kinematically Feasible Off-Road Planning Without OSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-road environments present unique challenges for autonomous navigation due to their complex and unstructured nature. Traditional global path-planning methods, which typically aim to minimize path length and travel time, perform poorly on large-scale maps and fail to account for critical factors such as real-time performance, kinematic feasibility, and memory efficiency. This paper introduces a novel global path-planning method specifically designed for off-road environments, addressing these essential factors. The method begins by constructing an intermediate map within the pixel coordinate system, incorporating geographical features like off-road trails, waterways, restricted and passable areas, and trees. The planning problem is then divided into three sub-problems: graph-based path planning, kinematic feasibility checking, and path smoothing. This approach effectively meets real-time performance requirements while ensuring kinematic feasibility and efficient memory use. The method was tested in various off-road environments with large-scale maps up to several square kilometers in size, successfully identifying feasible paths in an average of 1.5 seconds and utilizing approximately 1.5GB of memory under extreme conditions. The proposed framework is versatile and applicable to a wide range of off-road autonomous navigation tasks, including search and rescue missions and agricultural operations.</description>

      <title>From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</description>

      <title>DADS Under Unknown Input Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note shows that the Deadzone-Adapted Disturbance Suppression (DADS) adaptive control scheme is applicable to systems with unknown input coefficients. We study time-invariant, control-affine systems that satisfy the matching condition for which no bounds for the disturbance and the unknown parameters are known. The input coefficients can be time-varying as well as the unknown parameters. The only thing assumed for the input coefficients is their sign. The adaptive control design is Lyapunov-based and can be accomplished for every system for which a smooth globally stabilizing feedback exists when the disturbances are absent and all unknown parameters are known. The design is given by simple, explicit formulas. The proposed controllers guarantee an attenuation of the plant state to an assignable small level, despite unknown bounds on the parameters and disturbance, without a drift of the gain, state, and input.</description>

      <title>Learning to Capture Rocks using an Excavator: A Reinforcement Learning Approach with Guiding Reward Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rock capturing with standard excavator buckets is a challenging task typically requiring the expertise of skilled operators. Unlike soil digging, it involves manipulating large, irregular rocks in unstructured environments where complex contact interactions with granular material make model-based control impractical. Existing autonomous excavation methods focus mainly on continuous media or rely on specialized grippers, limiting their applicability to real-world construction sites. This paper introduces a fully data-driven control framework for rock capturing that eliminates the need for explicit modeling of rock or soil properties. A model-free reinforcement learning agent is trained in the AGX Dynamics simulator using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and a guiding reward formulation. The learned policy outputs joint velocity commands directly to the boom, arm, and bucket of a CAT365 excavator model. Robustness is enhanced through extensive domain randomization of rock geometry, density, and mass, as well as the initial configurations of the bucket, rock, and goal position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop and evaluate an RL-based controller for the rock capturing task. Experimental results show that the policy generalizes well to unseen rocks and varying soil conditions, achieving high success rates comparable to those of human participants while maintaining machine stability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of learning-based excavation strategies for discrete object manipulation without requiring specialized hardware or detailed material models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Learning via Dynamical System Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is critical for stable and efficient convergence of heterogeneous federated learning, where clients differ in computational capabilities, and data distributions are non-IID. Tuning hyperparameters is a manual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows combinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an end-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central agents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters. Our approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to draw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this perspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the system for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and central servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from numerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated learning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are dynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By designing a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and central agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of heterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client drift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being insensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited for rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for heterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning both client and server updates.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Scalable Robot Policy Evaluation with Imperfect Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.</description>

Abstract: Distance relays detect faults on transmission lines. They face uncertainty from the fault's location and resistance, as well as the current from the line's remote terminal. In this paper, we aggregate this uncertainty with the Minkowski sum. This allows us to explicitly model the power grid surrounding the relay's line, and in turn accommodate any mix of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources. To make the relay's task easier, inverters can inject perturbations, or auxiliary signals, such as negative-sequence current. We use Farkas' lemma to construct an optimization for designing inverter auxiliary signals.</description>

      <title>PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven control methods such as data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) have shown strong potential in efficient control of soft robots without explicit parametric models. However, in object manipulation tasks, unknown external payloads and disturbances can significantly alter the system dynamics and behavior, leading to offset error and degraded control performance. In this paper, we present a novel velocity-form DeePC framework that achieves robust and optimal control of soft robots under unknown payloads. The proposed framework leverages input-output data in an incremental representation to mitigate performance degradation induced by unknown payloads, eliminating the need for weighted datasets or disturbance estimators. We validate the method experimentally on a planar soft robot and demonstrate its superior performance compared to standard DeePC in scenarios involving unknown payloads.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Managing Temporal Obligations in GUCON Using SPARQL-star and RDF-star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, data frequently crosses organizational and jurisdictional boundaries, making effective governance essential. Usage control policies have emerged as a key paradigm for regulating data usage, safeguarding privacy, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring compliance with regulations. A central mechanism for usage control is the handling of obligations, which arise as a side effect of using and sharing data. Effective monitoring of obligations requires capturing usage traces and accounting for temporal aspects such as start times and deadlines, as obligations may evolve over times into different states, such as fulfilled, violated, or expired. While several solutions have been proposed for obligation monitoring, they often lack formal semantics or provide limited support for reasoning over obligation states. To address these limitations, we extend GUCON, a policy framework grounded in the formal semantics of SPAQRL graph patterns, to explicitly model the temporal aspects of an obligation. This extension enables the expressing of temporal obligations and supports continuous monitoring of their evolving states based on usage traces stored in temporal knowledge graphs. We demonstrate how this extended model can be represented using RDF-star and SPARQL-star and propose an Obligation State Manager that monitors obligation states and assess their compliance with respect to usage traces. Finally, we evaluate both the extended model and its prototype implementation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the rapid stabilization of an unstable wave equation, in which an unknown disturbance is located at the boundary condition. We address two different boundary conditions: Dirichlet- Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann. In both cases, we design a feedback law, located at the same place as the unknown disturbance, that forces the exponential decay of the energy for any desired decay rate while suppressing the effects of the unknown disturbance. For the feedback design, we employ the backstepping method, Lyapunov techniques and the sign multivalued operator. The well-posedness of the closed-loop system, which is a differential inclusion, is shown with the maximal monotone operator theory.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking M-LTSF: Frequency and Noise-Based Evaluation of Multivariate Long Time Series Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear (linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals. White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed, offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>A Fixed Point Framework for the Existence of EFX Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation up to any good (EFX) for linear valuations and establish new results by connecting this problem to a fixed point framework. Specifically, we first use randomized rounding to extend the discrete EFX constraints into a continuous space and show that an EFX allocation exists if and only if the optimal value of the continuously extended objective function is nonpositive. In particular, we demonstrate that this optimization problem can be formulated as an unconstrained difference of convex (DC) program, which can be further simplified to the minimization of a piecewise linear concave function over a polytope. Leveraging this connection, we show that the proposed DC program has a nonpositive optimal objective value if and only if a well-defined continuous vector map admits a fixed point. Crucially, we prove that the reformulated fixed point problem satisfies all the conditions of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, except that self-containedness is violated by an arbitrarily small positive constant. To address this, we propose a slightly perturbed continuous map that always admits a fixed point. This fixed point serves as a proxy for the fixed point (if it exists) of the original map, and hence for an EFX allocation through an appropriate transformation. Our results offer a new approach to establishing the existence of EFX allocations through fixed point theorems. Moreover, the equivalence with DC programming enables a more efficient and systematic method for computing such allocations (if one exists) using tools from nonlinear optimization. Our findings bridge the discrete problem of finding an EFX allocation with two continuous frameworks: solving an unconstrained DC program and identifying a fixed point of a continuous vector map.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Spread Bounds for Graph Diffusion via Laplacian Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation. Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation can occur.</description>

      <title>Optimal participation of energy communities in electricity markets under uncertainty. A multi-stage stochastic programming approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-stage stochastic programming model for the optimal participation of energy communities in electricity markets. The multi-stage aspect captures the different times at which variable renewable generation and electricity prices are observed. This results in large-scale optimization problem instances containing large scenario trees with 34 stages, to which scenario reduction techniques are applied. Case studies with real data are discussed to analyse proposed regulatory frameworks in Europe. The added value of considering stochasticity is also analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel, continuous finite-time control strategy for a class of nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties with unknown bounds. We propose an Adaptive Disturbance Observer-based Full-order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control (ADO-FOITSMC) to stabilize a chain of integrators in presence of exogenous disturbances whose time derivative is bounded by a constant that is not known a priori. Key features of this approach include a significant reduction in control input chattering and a non-monotonic adaptive law for the observer gains, which prevents overestimation while ensuring the global boundedness of system states. The effectiveness and practical viability of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through its application to the attitude stabilization of a rigid spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Stochastic Data-driven Predictive Control under Data Uncertainty - Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic constrained output-feedback data-driven predictive control scheme for linear time-invariant systems subject to bounded additive disturbances. The approach uses data-driven predictors based on an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma and requires only a single persistently exciting input-output data trajectory. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on availability of exact disturbance data. Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Context-Aware Approach for Anomaly Detection in Tele-driving Operations Under False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tele-operated driving (ToD) systems are special types of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) where the operator remotely controls the steering, acceleration, and braking actions of the vehicle. Malicious actors may inject false data in communication channels to manipulate the tele-operators driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for the safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection merely is not enough and the detection of an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that security incidents across vehicle fleets be detected and logged. Thus, cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled with an attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on steering control commands is created from real vehicle data. The risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-informed context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.</description>

      <title>DALNet: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for High-Fidelity Day-Ahead Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, is hindered by cumulative errors and forecasting lags, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</description>

      <title>MAD: A Magnitude And Direction Policy Parametrization for Stability Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce magnitude and direction (MAD) policies, a policy parameterization for reinforcement learning (RL) that preserves Lp closed-loop stability for nonlinear dynamical systems. Despite their completeness in describing all stabilizing controllers, methods based on nonlinear Youla and system-level synthesis are significantly impacted by the difficulty of parametrizing Lp-stable operators. In contrast, MAD policies introduce explicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the success of reinforcement learning pipelines - without jeopardizing closed-loop stability. This is achieved by letting the magnitude of the control input be described by a disturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on state-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further characterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model mismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parametrizations, MAD policies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL pipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability with no model information beyond assuming open-loop stability. Numerical experiments show that MAD policies trained with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods generalize to unseen scenarios - matching the performance of standard neural network policies while guaranteeing closed-loop stability by design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy systems. This paper presents the winning solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024). The solution provides accurate probabilistic forecasts for a wind-solar hybrid system, and achieves substantial trading revenue in the day-ahead electricity market. Key components include: (1) a stacking-based approach combining sister forecasts from various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) to provide wind power forecasts, (2) an online solar post-processing model to address the distribution shift in the online test set caused by increased solar capacity, (3) a probabilistic aggregation method for accurate quantile forecasts of hybrid generation, and (4) a stochastic trading strategy to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices. This paper also explores the potential of end-to-end learning to further enhance the trading revenue by shifting the distribution of forecast errors. Detailed case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. Code for all mentioned methods is available for reproduction and further research in both industry and academia.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of NNs. This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i) a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and (ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the design of chaotic signal-based transmit waveforms in a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-aided set-up for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We propose a differential chaos shift keying-based MF-RIS-aided set-up, where the MF-RIS is partitioned into three non-overlapping surfaces. The elements of the first sub-surface perform energy harvesting (EH), which in turn, provide the required power to the other two sub-surfaces responsible for transmission and reflection of the incident signal. By considering a frequency selective scenario and a realistic EH model, we characterize the chaotic MF-RIS-aided system in terms of its EH performance and the associated bit error rate. Thereafter, we characterize the harvested energy-bit error rate trade-off and derive a lower bound on the number of elements required to operate in the EH mode. Accordingly, we propose novel transmit waveform designs to demonstrate the importance of the choice of appropriate system parameters in the context of achieving self-sustainability.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent MCTS for Safety-Critical Coordination in Mixed-Autonomy Roundabouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating unsignalized roundabouts in mixed-autonomy traffic presents significant challenges due to dense vehicle interactions, lane-changing complexities, and behavioral uncertainties of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper proposes a safety-critical decision-making framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) navigating dual-lane roundabouts alongside HDVs. We formulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process and develop a hierarchical safety assessment mechanism that evaluates three critical interaction types: CAV-to-CAV (C2C), CAV-to-HDV (C2H), and CAV-to-Boundary (C2B). A key contribution is our lane-specific uncertainty model for HDVs, which captures distinct behavioral patterns between inner and outer lanes, with outer-lane vehicles exhibiting $2.3\times$ higher uncertainty due to less constrained movements. We integrate this safety framework with a multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that employs safety-aware pruning to eliminate high-risk trajectories while maintaining computational efficiency. The reward function incorporates Shapley value-based credit assignment to balance individual performance with group coordination. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</description>

      <title>On Fast Attitude Filtering Using Matrix Fisher Distributions with Stability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses two interrelated problems of the nonlinear filtering mechanism and fast attitude filtering with the matrix Fisher distribution (MFD) on the special orthogonal group. By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions, from a theoretical viewpoint.
  Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs is then proposed. These filters avoid the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with right-invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties. Moreover, we leverage the two properties and closed-form filtering iteration to prove the almost-global exponential stability of the proposed filter with right-invariant error for the single-axis rotation, which, to our knowledge, is not achieved by existing directional statistics-based filters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are significantly more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, they are also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty but consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow Learning Theory: Finite-Sample Guarantees for Vector-Field Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identification of continuous-time vector fields from irregularly sampled trajectories. We introduce Spectral Flow Learning (SFL), which learns in a windowed flow space using a lag-linear label operator that aggregates lagged Koopman actions. We provide finite-sample high-probability (FS-HP) guarantees for the class of variable-step linear multistep methods (vLLM). The FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory.
  This preliminary preprint states the results and sketches proofs, with full proofs and extensions deferred to a journal version.</description>

      <title>Code Generation and Conic Constraints for Model-Predictive Control on Microcontrollers with Conic-TinyMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful framework for controlling dynamic systems under constraints, but it remains challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms, especially for problems involving conic constraints. To address this, we extend recent work developing fast, structure-exploiting, cached ADMM solvers for embedded applications, to provide support for second-order cones, as well as C++ code generation from Python, MATLAB, and Julia for easy deployment. Microcontroller benchmarks show that our solver provides up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup, ranging from 10.6x to 142.7x, over state-of-the-art embedded solvers on QP and SOCP problems, and enables us to fit order-of-magnitude larger problems in memory. We validate our solver's deployed performance through simulation and hardware experiments, including conically-constrained trajectory tracking on a 27g Crazyflie quadrotor.

      <title>On-Demand Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown dynamics. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riccati operator under the Riemannian distance. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric adaptive payload tracking for an offshore crane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonparametric adaptive controller is proposed for crane control where the payload tracks a desired trajectory with feedback from the payload position. The controller is based on a novel version of partial feedback linearization where the unactuated crane load dynamics are controlled with the position of the actuated crane dynamics instead of the acceleration. This is made possible by taking advantage of the gravity terms in a new Cartesian model that we propose for the load dynamics. This Cartesian model structure makes it possible to implement a nonparametric adaptive controller which cancels disturbances on the crane load by approximating the effects of unknown disturbance forces and structurally unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). It is shown that the nonparametric adaptive controller leads to uniformly ultimately bounded errors in the presence of unknown forces and unmodeled dynamics. In addition, it is shown that the proposed partial feedback linearization based on the Cartesian model has certain advantages in payload tracking control also in the non-adaptive case. The performance of the nonparametric adaptive controller is validated in simulation and experiments with good results.</description>

      <title>A Corrector-aided Look-ahead Distance-based Guidance for Online Reference Path Following with an Efficient Mid-course Guidance Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient path-following is crucial in most of the applications of autonomous vehicles (UxV). Among various guidance strategies presented in literature, the look-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based nonlinear guidance has received significant attention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low cross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generating bounded lateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes problematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produces higher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high variation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of look-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance strategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized $L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV towards the vicinity of the start point of the reference path, while maintaining minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the vehicle reaches a close neighborhood of the reference path, a novel notion of corrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to generate the guidance command that effectively reduces the root mean square of the cross-track error and lateral acceleration requirement thereafter. Simulation results validate satisfactory performance of this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance strategy, along with the developed mid-course guidance scheme. Also, its superiority over the conventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme is established by simulation studies over different initial condition scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and researchers often lack access to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving towards semi-fullscale validation with R/V milliAmpere1 and full-scale validation with R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), including autonomy.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>

Abstract: In-Orbit Servicing and Active Debris Removal require advanced robotic capabilities for capturing and detumbling uncooperative targets. This work presents a hierarchical control framework for autonomous robotic capture of tumbling objects in space. A simulation environment is developed, incorporating sloshing dynamics of the chaser, a rarely studied effect in space robotics. The proposed controller combines an inner Lyapunov-based robust control loop for multi-body dynamics with an outer loop addressing an extended inverse kinematics problem. Simulation results show improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing control schemes.</description>

Abstract: This article shows that distributionally robust controller synthesis as investigated in \cite{taskesen2024distributionally} can be formulated as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) synthesis problem. To this end, we rely on well-established convexification techniques from robust control. The LMI synthesis problem we propose has the advantage that it can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf semi-definite programming (SDP) solvers. In addition, our formulation exposes the studied distributionally robust controller synthesis problem as an instance of robust $H_2$ synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.</description>
