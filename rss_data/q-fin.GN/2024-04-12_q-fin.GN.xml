      <title>Improving Retrieval for RAG based Question Answering Models on Financial Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate responses relies heavily on the quality of input provided, particularly when employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG enhances LLMs by sourcing the most relevant text chunk(s) to base queries upon. Despite the significant advancements in LLMs' response quality in recent years, users may still encounter inaccuracies or irrelevant answers; these issues often stem from suboptimal text chunk retrieval by RAG rather than the inherent capabilities of LLMs. To augment the efficacy of LLMs, it is crucial to refine the RAG process. This paper explores the existing constraints of RAG pipelines and introduces methodologies for enhancing text retrieval. It delves into strategies such as sophisticated chunking techniques, query expansion, the incorporation of metadata annotations, the application of re-ranking algorithms, and the fine-tuning of embedding algorithms. Implementing these approaches can substantially improve the retrieval quality, thereby elevating the overall performance and reliability of LLMs in processing and responding to queries.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Wash Trading of Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the liquidity of an asset includes two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion. We find that the liquidity diffusion has a higher correlation with crypto washing trading than the liquidity jump. We demonstrate that the treatment of washing trading significantly reduces the liquidity diffusion, but only marginally reduces the liquidity jump. We find that the ARMA-GARCH/EGARCH models are highly effective in modeling the liquidity-adjusted return with and without treatment on wash trading. We argue that treatment on wash trading is unnecessary in modeling established crypto assets that trade in mainstream exchanges, even if these exchanges are unregulated.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions in Competitive Industries: A Model Based on Temporal Dynamics and Industry Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M&amp;A activities are pivotal for market consolidation, enabling firms to augment market power through strategic complementarities. Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&amp;A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&amp;A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&amp;A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&amp;A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&amp;A cases between January 1997 and December 2020. Our approach marks a significant improvement over traditional models by providing detailed insights into M&amp;A activities and strategic recommendations for specific firms.</description>

      <title>Visibility graph analysis of crude oil futures markets: Insights from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the significant impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent COVID-19 pandemic on global financial markets, this study conducts a thorough analysis of three key crude oil futures markets: WTI, Brent, and Shanghai (SC). Employing the visibility graph (VG) methodology, we examine both static and dynamic characteristics using daily and high-frequency data. We identified a clear power-law decay in most VG degree distributions and highlighted the pronounced clustering tendencies within crude oil futures VGs. Our results also confirm an inverse correlation between clustering coefficient and node degree and further reveal that all VGs not only adhere to the small-world property but also exhibit intricate assortative mixing. Through the time-varying characteristics of VGs, we found that WTI and Brent demonstrate aligned behavior, while the SC market, with its unique trading mechanics, deviates. The 5-minute VGs' assortativity coefficient provides a deeper understanding of these markets' reactions to the pandemic and geopolitical events. Furthermore, the differential responses during the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflict underline the unique sensitivities of each market to global disruptions. Overall, this research offers profound insights into the structure, dynamics, and adaptability of these essential commodities markets in the face of worldwide challenges.</description>
