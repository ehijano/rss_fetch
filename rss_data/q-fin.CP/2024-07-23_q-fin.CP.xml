      <title>Is the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging a statistical arbitrage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) explains that there exist complete market models in which the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging can be a statistical arbitrage if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from including a speculative overlay within its hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI in Request-for-Quote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary financial landscape, accurately predicting the probability of filling a Request-For-Quote (RFQ) is crucial for improving market efficiency for less liquid asset classes. This paper explores the application of explainable AI (XAI) models to forecast the likelihood of RFQ fulfillment. By leveraging advanced algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Bayesian Neural Tree, we are able to improve the accuracy of RFQ fill rate predictions and generate the most efficient quote price for market makers. XAI serves as a robust and transparent tool for market participants to navigate the complexities of RFQs with greater precision.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Heston Model with Deep Differential Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gradient-based deep learning framework to calibrate the Heston option pricing model (Heston, 1993). Our neural network, henceforth deep differential network (DDN), learns both the Heston pricing formula for plain-vanilla options and the partial derivatives with respect to the model parameters. The price sensitivities estimated by the DDN are not subject to the numerical issues that can be encountered in computing the gradient of the Heston pricing function. Thus, our network is an excellent pricing engine for fast gradient-based calibrations. Extensive tests on selected equity markets show that the DDN significantly outperforms non-differential feedforward neural networks in terms of calibration accuracy. In addition, it dramatically reduces the computational time with respect to global optimizers that do not use gradient information.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
