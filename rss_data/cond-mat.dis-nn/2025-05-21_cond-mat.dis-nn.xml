      <title>Classical Criticality via Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a powerful platform for simulating magnetic materials and realizing statistical physics models, presenting a compelling alternative to classical Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that quantum annealers can accurately reproduce phase diagrams and simulate critical phenomena without suffering from the critical slowing down that often affects classical algorithms. To illustrate this, we study the piled-up dominoes model, which interpolates between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model and Villain's fully frustrated ``odd model''. We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics. Our results establish quantum annealers as robust statistical physics simulators, offering a novel pathway for studying phase transitions and critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, \textit{i.e.}, the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.</description>

      <title>From the perceptron to the cerebellum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perceptron has served as a prototypical neuronal learning machine in the physics community interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence, which included G\'erard Toulouse as one of its prominent figures. It has also been used as a model of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, a brain structure involved in motor learning, in the early influential theories of David Marr and James Albus. We review these theories, more recent developments in the field, and highlight questions of current interest.</description>

      <title>Chaotic percolation in the random geometry of maximum-density dimer packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of non-bipartite site-diluted lattices, such as the triangular and Shastry-Sutherland lattices in $d=2$ dimensions and the stacked-triangular and corner-sharing octahedral lattices in $d=3$, generically exhibit a nonzero density of monomers (unmatched vertices). Following a construction in the recent literature, we use the structure theory of Gallai and Edmonds to decompose the disordered lattice into ``${\mathcal R}$-type'' regions which host the monomers of any maximum matching, and perfectly matched ``${\mathcal P}$-type'' regions from which such monomers are excluded. When the density $n_v$ of quenched vacancies lies well within the low-$n_v$ geometrically percolated phase of the disordered lattice, we find that the random geometry of these regions exhibits unusual {\em Gallai-Edmonds percolation} phenomena. In $d=2$, we find two phases separated by a critical point, namely a phase in which all ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions are small, and a percolated phase that displays a striking lack of self-averaging in the thermodynamic limit: Each sample has a single percolating region which is of type ${\mathcal R}$ with probability $f_{\mathcal R}$ and type ${\mathcal P}$ with probability $1-f_{\mathcal R}$, where $f_{\mathcal R} \approx 0.50(2)$ is independent of $n_v$ (away from the critical region). In this regime, microscopic changes in the vacancy configuration lead to chaotic changes in the large-scale structure of ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions. In $d=3$, apart from a phase with small ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions, the thermodynamic limit exhibits {\em four} distinct percolated phases separated by critical points at successively lower $n_v$, two of which again display unusual violations of self-averaging. Physical consequences are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Modeling Structured Data Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines in the Teacher-Student Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>
