      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups. Part II: Precise computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Bridson-Dison group has quartic Dehn function, thereby providing the first precise computation of the Dehn function of a subgroup of a direct product of free groups with super-quadratic Dehn function. We also prove that coabelian subgroups of direct products of $n$ free groups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ and of corank $r\leq n-2$ have quadratic Dehn functions.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of Bestvina-Brady groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Subgroups of Graph Groups", 1987, J. Alg., Droms proved that all the subgroups of a right-angled Artin group (RAAG) defined by a finite simplicial graph $\Gamma$ are themselves RAAGs if, and only if, $\Gamma$ has no induced square graph nor line-graph of length $3$. The present work provides a similar result for specific normal subgroups of RAAGs, called Bestvina-Brady groups: We characterize those graphs in which every subgroup of such a group is itself a RAAG. In turn, we confirm several Galois theoretic conjectures for the pro-$p$ completions of these groups.</description>

      <title>Neighborhoods, connectivity, and diameter of the nilpotent graph of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nilpotent graph of a group $G$ is the simple and undirected graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if they generate a nilpotent subgroup of $G$. Here we discuss some topological properties of the nilpotent graph of a finite group $G$. Indeed, we characterize finite solvable groups whose closed neighborhoods are nilpotent subgroups. Moreover, we study the connectivity of the graph $\Gamma(G)$ obtained removing all universal vertices from the nilpotent graph of $G$. Some upper bounds to the diameter of $\Gamma(G)$ are provided when $G$ belongs to some classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Examining $H$-Closed Ducci Sequences on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be an endomorphism on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ so that \[D(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \; \text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m).\] We call the sequence $\{D^{\alpha}(\mathbf{u})\}_{\alpha=0}^{\infty}$ the Ducci sequence of $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$, which always enters a cycle. Now let $H$ be an endomorphism on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ such that \[H(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)=(x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, x_1).\] In this paper, we will talk about a few cases when $\mathbf{u}$ and $H^{\beta}(\mathbf{u})$ have the same Ducci cycle for $\beta &gt; 0$, as well as prove a few cases of $n,m$ where this is guaranteed for every $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$.</description>

      <title>Values of Ducci Periods for Sequences on $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D: \mathbb{Z}_m^n \to \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ be defined so that \[D(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \; \text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m).\] We call $D$ the Ducci function and the sequence $\{D^{\alpha}(\mathbf{u})\}_{\alpha=0}^{\infty}$ the Ducci sequence of $\mathbf{u}$ for $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$. Every Ducci sequence enters a cycle, so we can let $\text{Per}(\mathbf{u})$ be the number of tuples in the Ducci cycle of $\mathbf{u}$, or the period of $\mathbf{u}$. In this paper, we will look at what different possible values of $\text{Per}(\mathbf{u})$ we can have and some conditions that if $\mathbf{u}$ meets at least one of them, $\mathbf{u}$ will generate a period smaller than the maximum period.</description>

      <title>Minimal tetrahedra and an isoperimetric gap theorem in non-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate isoperimetric inequalities for Lipschitz 2-spheres in CAT(0) spaces, proving bounds on the volume of efficient null-homotopies. In one dimension lower, it is known that a quadratic inequality with a constant smaller than $c_2=1/(4\pi)$ -- the optimal constant for the Euclidean plane -- implies that the underlying space is Gromov hyperbolic, and a linear inequality holds. We establish the first analogous gap theorem in higher dimensions: if a proper CAT(0) space satisfies a Euclidean inequality for 2-spheres with a constant below the sharp threshold $c_3=1/(6\sqrt{\pi})$, then the space also admits an inequality with an exponent arbitrarily close to 1. As a corollary we obtain a similar result for Lipschitz surfaces of higher genus. Towards our main theorem we prove a (non-sharp) Euclidean isoperimetric inequality for null-homotopies of 2-spheres, apparently missing in the literature. A novelty in our approach is the introduction of minimal tetrahedra, which we demonstrate satisfy a linear inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that residually finite mapping tori of polynomially growing automorphisms of hyperbolic groups, groups hyperbolic relative to finitely many virtually polycyclic groups, right-angled Artin groups (when the automorphism is untwisted), and right-angled Coxeter groups have the cheap rebuilding property of Abert, Bergeron, Fraczyk, and Gaboriau. In particular, their torsion homology growth vanishes for every Farber sequence in every degree.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to van der Corput sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently discovered by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob in \cite{FT}.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Stability via Morse Limit Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgroup stability is a strong notion of quasiconvexity that generalizes convex cocompactness in a variety of settings. In this paper, we characterize stability of a subgroup by properties of its limit set on the Morse boundary. Given $H&lt;G$, both finitely generated, $H$ is stable exactly when all the limit points of $H$ are conical, or equivalently when all the limit points of $H$ are horospherical, as long as the limit set of $H$ is a compact subset of the Morse boundary for $G$. We also demonstrate an application of these results in the settings of the mapping class group for a finite type surface, $\text{Mod}(S)$.</description>

      <title>Enveloping Ellis semigroups as compactifications of transformations groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced. Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$ is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [31, 11, 13]). There is however much room for non-commutative results. Sz.-Nagy [41] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate families of contractions to (in general non-commuting) families of unitaries. To complement this, the present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) an explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) a full proof with an explicit construction, which utilises the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S{\l}oci\'{n}ski [37, 38] and which generalises to the setting where the index set $I$ is topologised; and 3) a second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Finally we discuss residuality results and applications to evolution problems, drawing a connection to quantum mechanics.</description>
