      <title>Unequal Journeys to Food Markets: Continental-Scale Evidence from Open Data in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food market accessibility is a critical yet underexplored dimension of food systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we present a continent-wide assessment of spatial food market accessibility in Africa, integrating open geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and the World Food Programme. We compare three complementary metrics: travel time to the nearest market, market availability within a 30-minute threshold, and an entropy-based measure of spatial distribution, to quantify accessibility across diverse settings. Our analysis reveals pronounced disparities: rural and economically disadvantaged populations face substantially higher travel times, limited market reach, and less spatial redundancy. These accessibility patterns align with socioeconomic stratification, as measured by the Relative Wealth Index, and moderately correlate with food insecurity levels, assessed using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Overall, results suggest that access to food markets plays a relevant role in shaping food security outcomes and reflects broader geographic and economic inequalities. This framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for identifying underserved regions and supporting equitable infrastructure planning and policy design across diverse African contexts.</description>

      <title>2ACT: AI-Accentuated Career Transitions via Skill Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the AI-Accentuated Career Transitions framework, advancing beyond binary automation narratives to examine how distinct AI usage patterns reshape occupational mobility. Analyzing 545 occupations through multivariate modeling, we identify six qualitatively distinct human-AI usage patterns that differentially predict placement across job preparation zones. Our findings empirically validate the "missing middle" hypothesis: automation-focused usage strongly predicts lower job zone placement while augmentative usage predicts higher zones. Most significantly, we identify specific Knowledge, Skill, and Abilities combinations with AI usage patterns that function as "skill bridges" facilitating upward mobility. The interaction between task iteration AI usage and cognitive skills emerges as the strongest advancement predictor, creating pathways across traditionally disconnected occupational categories. Counterintuitively, despite directive AI's negative main effect, its interaction with technical knowledge positively predicts advancement in specialized domains. Comparative model testing confirms that AI usage patterns represent a distinct dimension of occupational classification that adds significant explanatory power beyond traditional skill measures. These findings reveal AI as a skill amplifier that widens capability gaps rather than an equalizing force. The 2ACT framework provides strategic guidance for workers, curriculum designers, policymakers, and organizations navigating increasingly AI-mediated career pathways.</description>

      <title>Strategic ESG-Driven Human Resource Practices: Transforming Employee Management for Sustainable Organizational Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This research explores the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on employee performance and well-being in private higher education institutions in Bandung, West Java. It seeks to provide insights into how effective ESG integration can enhance organizational performance and employee satisfaction. Methodology: A quantitative approach employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) analyzed the relationships among constructs: environmental practices, social practices, governance practices, and the dependent variable, employee performance and well-being. Data were collected from 270 respondents through stratified random sampling across various administrative roles in 138 private higher education institutions. Findings: The results showed that environmental practices positively impact employee performance and well-being, with social practices also contributing. Governance practices mediate and amplify these effects. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating sustainable practices into organizational strategies to improve employee outcomes and overall institutional performance. Originality: This study explores the impact of ESG practices on employee performance in private higher education institutions, focusing on sustainability to enhance engagement and productivity. Unlike previous research, which focused primarily on corporate sectors or public universities, it emphasizes the unique challenges of private institutions, particularly in Bandung, offering new insights into governance practices as mediators.</description>

      <title>A conditional match rate anomaly and ranking pressure in residency matching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medical residency matching markets of the U.S. and Japan, we observe that an applicant's probability of matching with their first-listed program is disproportionately higher than that of matching with their second-listed program, given that they were rejected by the first. In contrast, the conditional probabilities of matching with lower-ranked programs are markedly lower and remain relatively stable. Furthermore, several experts have noted that participating programs sometimes exert pressure on applicants to manipulate the order of their rank-order lists.
  In this study, we show that this pressure can account for the observed probability pattern, considering the verifiability of being ranked first on the list. Using empirical data, we identify the prevalence of ranking pressure and quantify its impact on rank-order list changes and welfare under a simplified acceptance and pressure process. Additionally, we explore the implementation of a random permutation of the submitted rank-order list as a measure to counteract list reordering due to pressure. Our analysis shows that the benefits of this intervention outweigh the associated efficiency losses.</description>

      <title>When Incentives and Nudges Meet: Promoting Budget Allocations for Undervalued Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Budget officers often assess public project proposals based on available financial support and expected outcomes. However, behavioral factors such as time discounting and psychological hesitation may lead to underinvestment in programs with delayed but significant benefits. This study investigates whether financial incentives and non-financial nudges can influence budgetary decisions in local governments. We conducted a nationwide mail-based survey experiment targeting budget officers in Japanese municipalities and received 490 valid responses. Using a 2*2 randomized design, we tested the independent and combined effects of a financial incentive (a 50% national subsidy) and a non-financial nudge (loss framing and peer information). All three treatments significantly increased assessed budget amounts compared to the control group. The largest effect appeared in the combination group (approximately 1.1 million JPY higher, p &lt; .01). Both the financial incentive and the nudge independently increased assessments by approximately 650,000-670,000 JPY (p &lt; .01). Notably, only the nudge raised the self-financed portion of the budget. These findings demonstrate how low-cost behavioral interventions can improve budget assessments for undervalued projects. As an application, we embedded the experiment in a case involving HPV vaccine promotion in Japan, but the approach can be broadly relevant to other public policy domains requiring forward-looking budget decisions.</description>

      <title>Sustainability of cities under declining population and decreasing distance frictions: The case of Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a statistical model that integrates economic agglomeration theory and power-law distributions of city sizes to project future population distribution on 1-km grid cells. We focus on Japan -- a country at the forefront of rapid population decline. Drawing on official population projections and empirical patterns from past urban evolution in response to the development of high-speed rail and highway networks, we examine how ongoing demographic contraction and expected reductions in distance frictions may reshape urban geography. Our analysis suggests that urban economies will consolidate around fewer and larger cities, each of which will experience a flattening of population density as the decentralization of urban populations accelerates, while rural areas are expected to experience further depopulation as a result of these spatial and economic shifts. By identifying sustainable urban cores capable of anchoring regional economies, our model provides a framework for policymakers to manage population decline while maintaining resilience through optimized infrastructure and resource allocation focused on these key urban centers.</description>

      <title>Big Data and the Computational Social Science of Entrepreneurship and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve, scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text, network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models, combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by coupling big data with big models.</description>

      <title>Revealing economic facts: LLMs know more than they say</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables, we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.</description>

      <title>Mapping the disaggregated economy in real-time: Using granular payment network data to complement national accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era of rapid change, timely and disaggregated economic insights are crucial for effective policymaking. This study explores the potential of real-time payment data to complement traditional economic measurement. Using anonmysed UK business payments from 2015-2023, we analysed inter-industry financial flows at a granular 5-digit SIC level and compared them systematically with established economic indicators such as GDP and input-output tables (IOTs). Our findings show strong correlations with GDP and qualitative consistency with official IOTs, highlighting the value of the novel high-frequency data for real-time economic monitoring. We also benchmarked network statistics at the 5-digit level, showing how industry-specific payment structures align with stylised facts from the empirical economic network literature. While outlining methodological and interpretative challenges, we discuss the integration of such bottom-up data into national accounts. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to advance economic measurement and offers additional tools for tracking economic dynamics in real time.</description>

      <title>From catch-up to frontier: The utility model as a learning device to escape the middle-income trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second-tier patent system, known as utility models (UMs), has been considered a tool for supporting technological learning in catching-up economies. UMs often impose lower inventive step requirements than patents, making them accessible to inventors with limited capacity. However, the mechanisms by which the UM system supports the catch-up process and the system's long-term impact in the post-catch-up period remain underexplored. We address this gap by empirically examining how and under which conditions the UM system can create synergies with catch-up strategies and influence the emerging industrial structure in the post-catch-up phase. Drawing on the literature on catch-up and intellectual property rights (IPR), we argue that catch-up strategies that prioritize imitative and adaptive learning in short-cycle technologies can be complemented by the UM system, supporting the development of indigenous capabilities to produce high-impact frontier technologies and internalize their value-added. Using South Korea as a case study, we present two key findings: First, the country's post-catch-up frontier technologies (US patents) are more impactful when they build on active learning experiences encoded in domestic UMs. Second, UM-reliant frontier technologies contribute to value internalization (local value-added relative to foreign value-added). Our findings extend the literature on the role of different types of IPR in various stages of development and inform policy discussions on how UMs can be used to support capability building in developing countries.</description>

      <title>Procompetitive effects of vertical takeovers. Evidence from the European Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal impact of takeovers on firm-level financial accounts on a sample of 4,482 targets in the European Union in the period 2007- 2021. Findings suggest that horizontal integrations do not have a statistically significant impact, while vertical takeovers bring about a lower markup (0.7%), a larger market share (2.5%), a higher profitability (2.3%), and a lower capital intensity (7.2%). The impact of vertical integrations grows over time, and it is higher when the corporate perimeter of the acquirer is bigger. Our results point to strategies aimed at eliminating double profit margins along supply chains. Finally, we reconnect with the debate initiated by the U.S. Vertical Merger Guidelines in 2020 and 2023, where the presumption of harm after vertical deals has been softened, thus considering procompetitive effects, but the discussion of potential foreclosure risks has been expanded.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Global Income Convergence in the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has documented a reversal from divergence to convergence in income levels between rich and poor countries after 2000. This paper employs a growth accounting framework to investigate the proximate sources of convergence over the period 1980-2019. I find that while output levels began to converge only after 2000, capital (physical and human) had already been converging during 1980-2000. The divergence in total factor productivity (TFP) during this earlier period offset the gains from capital convergence, resulting in little overall income convergence. After 2000, capital maintained its pattern of convergence, and, unlike in the earlier period, TFP also began to converge. Quantitatively, more than half of the convergence between 2000 and 2019-and nearly all the convergence between 1980 and 2019 outside Sub-Saharan Africa-can be attributed to the convergence in capital rather than to improvements in TFP. These findings highlight that factor accumulation has played a much larger role in driving long-run convergence dynamics than previously documented in the literature.</description>

      <title>The "strength" of patent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patent systems vary widely in how rigorously they define and enforce inventors' rights. On one hand, formal statutes ("law on the books") set the scope of what can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other hand, actual enforcement ("law in practice") determines whether those rights hold up in practice. To capture these dimensions, researchers have developed simple indices of legal provisions and more nuanced proxies for enforcement effectiveness, along with metrics of how applicant-friendly each office's procedures are. Comparative studies of "twin patents" -- identical inventions filed in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic differences in grant rates and bar heights across major offices. By combining these approaches, we gain a multifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances statutory design, administrative practice, and actual enforcement. This perspective is crucial for understanding how different regimes support innovation and shape global knowledge flows.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</description>
