      <title>Exploring the limitations of blood pressure estimation using the photoplethysmography signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular morbidity, underscores the need for accurate and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising approach to this end. However, the precision of BP estimates derived from PPG signals has been the subject of ongoing debate, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness and constraints. We developed a calibration-based Siamese ResNet model for BP estimation, using a signal input paired with a reference BP reading. We compared the use of normalized PPG (N-PPG) against the normalized Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (N-IABP) signals as input. The N-IABP signals do not directly present systolic and diastolic values but theoretically provide a more accurate BP measure than PPG signals since it is a direct pressure sensor inside the body. Our strategy establishes a critical benchmark for PPG performance, realistically calibrating expectations for PPG's BP estimation capabilities. Nonetheless, we compared the performance of our models using different signal-filtering conditions to evaluate the impact of filtering on the results. We evaluated our method using the AAMI and the BHS standards employing the VitalDB dataset. The N-IABP signals meet with AAMI standards for both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), with errors of 1.29+-6.33mmHg for systolic pressure and 1.17+-5.78mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively for the raw N-IABP signal. In contrast, N-PPG signals, in their best setup, exhibited inferior performance than N-IABP, presenting 1.49+-11.82mmHg and 0.89+-7.27mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of employing PPG for BP estimation, showing that these signals contain information correlated to BP but may not be sufficient for predicting it accurately.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an in-vivo imaging method to detect magnetic nanoparticles for blood vessel imaging and molecular target imaging. Compared with conventional molecular imaging devices (such as nuclear medicine imaging PET and SPECT), magnetic nanoparticles have longer storage periods than radionuclides without ionizing radiation. MPI has higher detection sensitivity compared with MRI. To accurately locate molecular probes in living organisms, high-resolution images are needed to meet the requirements of precision medicine. The spatial resolution of the latest domestic and international MPI equipment is 1-6 mm and has not yet met the requirements of medical imaging detection. We previously studied the spatial encoding technology based on pulsed square wave stimulation, which significantly improved the image resolution along the field free line (FFL) direction. This study proposes an innovative idea of high-resolution MPI based on stimulated emission depletion (STED) of magnetic nanoparticle signals. The stimulated emission was implemented by using cosine stimulation on FFL-based MPI scanner systems. The STED signal was generated by adding an offset magnetic field parallel to the FFL, which may form a donut-shaped focal spot or a regular Gaussian focal spot depending on the offset field strength. Focal spot modulation techniques and deconvolution algorithms were developed to improve image resolution.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided in the widely used ICRU Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Reduction of Number of Spots and Energy Layers in Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy for Rapid Spot Scanning Delivery</title>

Abstract: Reducing proton treatment time improves patient comfort and decreases the risk of error from intra-fractional motion, but must be balanced against clinical goals and treatment plan quality. We formulated the proton treatment planning problem as a convex optimization problem with a cost function consisting of a dosimetric plan quality term plus a weighted $l_1$ regularization term. We iteratively solved this problem and adaptively updated the regularization weights to promote the sparsity of both the spots and energy layers. The proposed algorithm was tested on four head-and-neck cancer patients, and its performance was compared with existing standard $l_1$ and group $l_2$ regularization methods. We also compared the effectiveness of the three methods ($l_1$, group $l_2$, and reweighted $l_1$) at improving plan delivery efficiency without compromising dosimetric plan quality by constructing each of their Pareto surfaces charting the trade-off between plan delivery and plan quality. The reweighted $l_1$ regularization method reduced the number of spots and energy layers by an average over all patients of 40% and 35%, respectively, with an insignificant cost to dosimetric plan quality. From the Pareto surfaces, it is clear that reweighted $l_1$ provided a better trade-off between plan delivery efficiency and dosimetric plan quality than standard $l_1$ or group $l_2$ regularization, requiring the lowest cost to quality to achieve any given level of delivery efficiency. In summary, reweighted $l_1$ regularization is a powerful method for simultaneously promoting the sparsity of spots and energy layers at a small cost to dosimetric plan quality. This sparsity reduces the time required for spot scanning and energy layer switching, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of proton plans.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>

Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D MRI Super Resolution with Degradation Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06891v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging is critical in aiding doctors in their diagnoses and image-guided treatments. However, acquiring HR images can be time-consuming and costly. Consequently, deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has emerged as a promising solution for generating super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. Unfortunately, training such neural networks requires aligned authentic HR and LR image pairs, which are challenging to obtain due to patient movements during and between image acquisitions. While rigid movements of hard tissues can be corrected with image registration, aligning deformed soft tissues is complex, making it impractical to train neural networks with authentic HR and LR image pairs. Previous studies have focused on SRR using authentic HR images and down-sampled synthetic LR images. However, the difference in degradation representations between synthetic and authentic LR images suppresses the quality of SR images reconstructed from authentic LR images. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unsupervised Degradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN). Our network consists of a degradation learning network and an SRR network. The degradation learning network downsamples the HR images using the degradation representation learned from the misaligned or unpaired LR images. The SRR network then learns the mapping from the down-sampled HR images to the original ones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art networks and is a promising solution to the challenges in clinical settings.</description>
