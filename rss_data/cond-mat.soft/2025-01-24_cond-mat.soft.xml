      <title>Liquid water transport model in hydrophilic granular : Preliminary validation with drying rate of hierarchical granular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drying rate profile of granular beds can be divided into the constant rate period (CRP), which is characterized by a nearly constant drying rate, and the falling rate period (FRP), in which the drying rate rapidly decays. In order to explain this behavior quantitatively, we proposed a simple one-dimensional power law model in which the product of the water permeability and the pressure gradient is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the saturation. To test this model, we measured the drying rates of glass beads and hierarchical granular materials produced by sintering and breaking glass beads. Our results and those of previous experiments showed consistency with the power law. The obtained proportional constant of the experimental power law also shows a rough agreement with that estimated from previous studies on water permeability and capillary pressure. Drying behavior in FRP also agrees with our model in some points. The remnant deviation of the model from experimental results may be attributed to the inhomogeneity of granular media, which was qualitatively verified.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Mechanical Memory in a Random Fibrous Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered fibrous matrices, formed by the random assembly of fibers, provide the structural framework for many biological systems and biomaterials. Applied deformation modifies the alignment and stress states of constituent fibers, tuning the nonlinear elastic response of these materials. While it is generally presumed that fibers return to their original configurations after deformation is released, except when neighboring fibers coalesce or individual fibers yield, this reversal process remains largely unexplored. The intricate geometry of these matrices leaves an incomplete understanding of whether releasing deformation fully restores the matrix or introduces new microstructural deformation mechanisms. To address this gap, we investigated the evolution of matrix microstructures during the release of an applied deformation. Numerical simulations were performed on quasi-two-dimensional matrices of random fibers under localized tension, with fibers modeled as beams in finite element analysis. After tension release, the matrix exhibited permanent mechanical remodeling, with greater remodeling occurring at higher magnitudes of applied tension, indicative of the matrix preserving its loading history as mechanical memory. This response was surprising; it occurred despite the absence of explicit plasticity mechanisms, such as activation of inter-fiber cohesion or fiber yielding. We attributed the observed remodeling to the gradient in fiber alignment that developed within the matrix microstructure under applied tension, driving the subsequent changes in matrix properties during the release of applied tension. Therefore, random fibrous matrices tend to retain mechanical memory due to their intricate geometry.</description>

      <title>Compaction of Granular Columns under Thermal Cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials undergo compaction under periodic temperature fluctuations, leading to various engineering and geological phenomena from landslides to silo compaction. Although thermal effects on granular materials have been extensively studied in soil mechanics and geology, the underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the compaction dynamics of granular materials subjected to thermal cycling using monodisperse glass beads and polydisperse sand packings. We demonstrate that differential thermal expansion between the container and the grains drives compaction through shear in our experimental systems. We quantify compaction dynamics using three established fitting models: Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW), double-exponential, and logarithmic functions. Our results reveal that granular materials exhibit slow relaxation processes in response to weak perturbations, displaying aging dynamics similar to those observed in glassy systems. These findings provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of granular compaction with broad implications for geological and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Critical evaluations of different implementations of Edwards volume ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular systems can display reproducible microscopic distributions governed by a few macroscopic parameters, parallel to equilibrium statistical mechanics. Building on this analogy, Edwards' s pioneering framework proposes a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states, introducing compactivity chi as an effective temperature. Despite its promise, debates persist regarding the framework' s formulation and validity, with practical implementation often exposing inconsistencies. This study systematically examines different implementations using experimental data from spherical particle packings with varying friction coefficients, subjected to tapping and shearing. Our findings show that the heat capacity and overlapping histogram methods yield consistent Chi values. Discrepancies in other approaches, such as the free volume model, primarily stem from differing reference-state compactivities and microstate definitions, whereas the mean-field theory, which effectively accounts for mechanical stability within a geometric coordination-number phase space, is constrained by its isostatic assumption and inherent approximations. Additionally, an effective temperature Chi_f defined on Delaunay tetrahedra better describes topological excitations, but represents a quasi-equilibrium state, with true equilibrium achieved only under Chi. This study refines and expands our understanding of the Edwards volume ensemble in line with Edwards' s original ideas, highlighting the combined contributions of friction and inherently disordered packing structures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Efficient Extraction of Uranyl Ions from Aqueous Waste through Graphene/CNT-PAMAM Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing threat of uranium contamination to environmental and human health due to its radiotoxicity demands the development of novel and efficient adsorbents for remediation. In this study, we investigated the potential of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of generations 1 to 4 (G1 - G4) functionalized with graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as adsorbents for uranyl ion removal from aqueous solutions. By combining atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with experimental validation, we examined the influence of pH, uranyl ion concentration, and dendrimer generation on adsorption behavior. Our study revealed that uranyl ion adsorption is greater when PAMAM is grafted onto graphene/CNT than pristine PAMAM. However, PAMAM-grafted CNTs exhibit superior adsorption capacity at specific uranyl concentrations due to their curvature and abundant accessible binding sites. Higher-generation PAMAM dendrimers grafted onto graphene/CNTs exhibit greater adsorption capacity due to the increased availability of binding sites, which is consistent with experimental observations. The adsorption capability of uranyl ions in all four generations of the PAMAM dendrimer increased as the concentration of uranyl ions increased. Adsorption capacity increases with increasing uranyl ion concentration, and adsorption occurs on both PAMAM and graphene/CNT surfaces, with saturation observed at higher concentrations. This study provides insights into the adsorption mechanisms and highlights the potential of PAMAM-based nanocomposites for efficient uranyl ion extraction and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Scattering Insights into Shear-Induced Scission of Rod-like Micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis
  Understanding the scission of rod-like micelles under mechanical forces is crucial for optimizing their stability and behavior in industrial applications. This study investigates how micelle length, flexibility, and external forces interact, offering insights into the design of micellar systems in processes influenced by mechanical stress. Although significant, direct experimental observations of flow-induced micellar scission using scattering techniques remain scarce.
  Experiments and Simulations
  Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to explore the shear response of aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions with sodium nitrate. Rheological tests show shear thinning with no shear banding, ensuring a uniform flow field for reliable interpretation of scattering data. As shear rate increases, the scattering spectra show angular distortion, which is analyzed using spherical harmonic decomposition to characterize flow-induced scission and micelle orientation under shear.
  Findings
  Two analysis steps are used: a model-independent spectral eigendecomposition reveals a decrease in micellar length, while regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the length distribution and mean length with shear rate. Additionally, micelle alignment increases with shear, quantified by the orientational distribution function. These findings provide experimental evidence for flow-induced alignment and scission, offering a new framework for understanding shear-induced phenomena in micellar systems</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of hydrodynamic interactions in spherically-confined drying colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of colloidal particles confined in drying spherical droplets using both dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) and particle-based simulations. In particular, we focus on the advection-dominated regime typical of aqueous droplets drying at room temperature and systematically investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions during this nonequilibrium process. In general, drying produces transient particle concentration gradients within the droplet in this regime, with a considerable accumulation of particles at the droplet's liquid-vapor interface. We find that these gradients become significantly larger with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles instead of a free-draining hydrodynamic approximation; however, the solvent's boundary conditions at the droplet's interface (unbounded, slip, or no-slip) do not have a significant effect on the particle distribution. DDFT calculations leveraging radial symmetry of the drying droplet are in excellent agreement with particle-based simulations for free-draining hydrodynamics, but DDFT unexpectedly fails for pairwise hydrodynamic interactions after the particle concentration increases during drying, manifesting as an ejection of particles from the droplet. We hypothesize that this unphysical behavior originates from an inaccurate approximation of the two-body density correlations based on the bulk pair correlation function, which we support by measuring the confined equilibrium two-body density correlations using particle-based simulations. We identify some potential strategies for addressing this issue in DDFT.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realizations of Information Engines: Beyond Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gathering information about a system enables greater control over it. This principle lies at the core of information engines, which use measurement-based feedback to rectify thermal noise and convert information into work. Originating from Maxwell's and Szil\'ard's thought experiments, the thermodynamics of information engines has steadily advanced, with recent experimental realizations both confirming established results and pushing the field forward. Coupled with technological advances and developments in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, novel implementations of information engines continue to challenge theoretical understanding. In this perspective, we discuss recent progress and highlight new opportunities, such as applying information engines to active, many-body, and inertial systems, and leveraging tools like optimal control to design their driving protocols.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Approach to nonequilibrium: from anomalous to Brownian diffusion via non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in experimental techniques such as single particle tracking allows to analyze both nonequilibrium properties and approach to equilibrium. There are examples showing that processes occurring at finite timescales are distinctly different than their equilibrium counterparts. In this work we analyze a similar problem of approach to nonequilibrium. We consider an archetypal model of nonequilibrium system consisting of a Brownian particle dwelling in a spatially periodic potential and driven by an external time-periodic force. We focus on a diffusion process and monitor its development in time. In the presented parameter regime the excess kurtosis measuring the Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution evolves in a non-monotonic way: first it is negative (platykurtic form), next it becomes positive (leptokurtic form) and then decays to zero (mesokurtic form). Despite the latter fact diffusion in the long time limit is Brownian, yet non-Gaussian. Moreover, we discover a correlation between non-Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution and transient anomalous diffusion behavior emerging for finite timescales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of granular hopper flows: a configurational mode controls the stability of clogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit several characteristic but poorly understood behaviors: temporary clogs (pauses) where flow stops before later spontaneously restarting, permanent clogs that last indefinitely, and non-Gaussian, non-monotonic flow-rate statistics. These aspects have been studied independently, but a model of hopper flow that includes all three has not been formulated. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that provides a unifying dynamical explanation of all three behaviors: coupling between the flow rate and a hidden mode that controls the stability of clogs. In the theory, flow rate evolves according to Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise and an absorbing state at zero flow, conditional on the hidden mode. The model fully reproduces the statistics of pause and clog events of a large ($&gt;40,000$ flows) experimental dataset, including non-exponentially distributed clogging times and non-Gaussian flow rate distribution, and explains the stretched-exponential growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Further, we identify the physical nature of the hidden mode in microscopic configurational features, including size and smoothness of the static arch structure formed during pauses and clogs. Our work provides a unifying framework for several poorly understood clogging phenomena, and suggests numerous new paths toward further understanding of this complex system.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling and imaging of thin curved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin films or sheets subjected to external forces often undergo mechanical instability, leading to regular patterns of wrinkles, folds, and creases. As can be anticipated from the difficulty of flattening a curved globe, any natural curvature of the sheet will have a strong influence on these instabilities. Here, we develop a non-invasive synthetic schlieren imaging technique to image and reconstruct the surface of wrinkling curved sheets, confined to float on water. Our method circumvents the small-amplitude limit of related imaging techniques, and we demonstrate robust means to estimate the reconstruction accuracy. We then evaluate how the sign and magnitude of Gaussian curvature affects the wrinkling of thin curved sheets, and compare observations of the wrinkle wavelength, amplitude and domain structure with recent theoretical predictions. While generally validating model predictions, we find that the assumption of a conserved surface area during wrinkling should be treated with some care. The control of wrinkling behavior demonstrated here can have application in the design of liquid lenses, microfluidics, active textured surfaces, and flexible electronic components.</description>
