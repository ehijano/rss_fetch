      <title>UniFed: A Universal Federation of a Mixture of Highly Heterogeneous Medical Image Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in federated learning lies in mixing heterogeneous datasets and classification tasks while minimizing the high communication cost caused by clients as well as the exchange of weight updates with the server over a fixed number of rounds. This results in divergent model convergence rates and performance, which may hinder their deployment in precision medicine. In real-world scenarios, client data is collected from different hospitals with extremely varying components (e.g., imaging modality, organ type, etc). Previous studies often overlooked the convoluted heterogeneity during the training stage where the target learning tasks vary across clients as well as the dataset type and their distributions. To address such limitations, we unprecedentedly introduce UniFed, a universal federated learning paradigm that aims to classify any disease from any imaging modality. UniFed also handles the issue of varying convergence times in the client-specific optimization based on the complexity of their learning tasks. Specifically, by dynamically adjusting both local and global models, UniFed considers the varying task complexities of clients and the server, enhancing its adaptability to real-world scenarios, thereby mitigating issues related to overtraining and excessive communication. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a sequential model transfer mechanism that takes into account the diverse tasks among hospitals and a dynamic task-complexity based ordering. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and convergence time over relevant benchmarks in diagnosing retina, histopathology, and liver tumour diseases under federated learning. Our UniFed code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/UniFed.</description>

      <title>Anatomical Foundation Models for Brain MRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Model-Based Optoacoustic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical adoption of multispectral optoacoustic tomography necessitates improvements of the image quality available in real-time, as well as a reduction in the scanner financial cost. Deep learning approaches have recently unlocked the reconstruction of high-quality optoacoustic images in real-time. However, currently used deep neural network architectures require powerful graphics processing units to infer images at sufficiently high frame-rates, consequently greatly increasing the price tag. Herein we propose EfficientDeepMB, a relatively lightweight (17M parameters) network architecture achieving high frame-rates on medium-sized graphics cards with no noticeable downgrade in image quality. EfficientDeepMB is built upon DeepMB, a previously established deep learning framework to reconstruct high-quality images in real-time, and upon EfficientNet, a network architectures designed to operate of mobile devices. We demonstrate the performance of EfficientDeepMB in terms of reconstruction speed and accuracy using a large and diverse dataset of in vivo optoacoustic scans. EfficientDeepMB is about three to five times faster than DeepMB: deployed on a medium-sized NVIDIA RTX A2000 Ada, EfficientDeepMB reconstructs images at speeds enabling live image feedback (59Hz) while DeepMB fails to meets the real-time inference threshold (14Hz). The quantitative difference between the reconstruction accuracy of EfficientDeepMB and DeepMB is marginal (data residual norms of 0.1560 vs. 0.1487, mean absolute error of 0.642 vs. 0.745). There are no perceptible qualitative differences between images inferred with the two reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>Investigation of unsupervised and supervised hyperspectral anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral sensing is a valuable tool for detecting anomalies and distinguishing between materials in a scene. Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HS-AD) helps characterize the captured scenes and separates them into anomaly and background classes. It is vital in agriculture, environment, and military applications such as RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) missions. We previously designed an equal voting ensemble of hyperspectral unmixing and three unsupervised HS-AD algorithms. We later utilized a supervised classifier to determine the weights of a voting ensemble, creating a hybrid of heterogeneous unsupervised HS-AD algorithms with a supervised classifier in a model stacking, which improved detection accuracy. However, supervised classification methods usually fail to detect novel or unknown patterns that substantially deviate from those seen previously. In this work, we evaluate our technique and other supervised and unsupervised methods using general hyperspectral data to provide new insights.</description>

      <title>BVI-UGC: A Video Quality Database for User-Generated Content Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, user-generated content (UGC) has become one of the major video types consumed via streaming networks. Numerous research contributions have focused on assessing its visual quality through subjective tests and objective modeling. In most cases, objective assessments are based on a no-reference scenario, where the corresponding reference content is assumed not to be available. However, full-reference video quality assessment is also important for UGC in the delivery pipeline, particularly associated with the video transcoding process. In this context, we present a new UGC video quality database, BVI-UGC, for user-generated content transcoding, which contains 60 (non-pristine) reference videos and 1,080 test sequences. In this work, we simulated the creation of non-pristine reference sequences (with a wide range of compression distortions), typical of content uploaded to UGC platforms for transcoding. A comprehensive crowdsourced subjective study was then conducted involving more than 3,500 human participants. Based on this collected subjective data, we benchmarked the performance of 10 full-reference and 11 no-reference quality metrics. Our results demonstrate the poor performance (SROCC values are lower than 0.6) of these metrics in predicting the perceptual quality of UGC in two different scenarios (with or without a reference).</description>

      <title>Lesion-aware network for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning brought boosts to auto diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis, thus, greatly helping ophthalmologists for early disease detection, which contributes to preventing disease deterioration that may eventually lead to blindness. It has been proved that convolutional neural network (CNN)-aided lesion identifying or segmentation benefits auto DR screening. The key to fine-grained lesion tasks mainly lies in: (1) extracting features being both sensitive to tiny lesions and robust against DR-irrelevant interference, and (2) exploiting and re-using encoded information to restore lesion locations under extremely imbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a CNN-based DR diagnosis network with attention mechanism involved, termed lesion-aware network, to better capture lesion information from imbalanced data. Specifically, we design the lesion-aware module (LAM) to capture noise-like lesion areas across deeper layers, and the feature-preserve module (FPM) to assist shallow-to-deep feature fusion. Afterward, the proposed lesion-aware network (LANet) is constructed by embedding the LAM and FPM into the CNN decoders for DR-related information utilization. The proposed LANet is then further extended to a DR screening network by adding a classification layer. Through experiments on three public fundus datasets with pixel-level annotations, our method outperforms the mainstream methods with an area under curve of 0.967 in DR screening, and increases the overall average precision by 7.6%, 2.1%, and 1.2% in lesion segmentation on three datasets. Besides, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of the proposed sub-modules.</description>

      <title>Discriminating retinal microvascular and neuronal differences related to migraines: Deep Learning based Crossectional Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder, has been associated with various ocular manifestations suggestive of neuronal and microvascular deficits. However, there is limited understanding of the extent to which retinal imaging may discriminate between individuals with migraines versus without migraines. In this study, we apply convolutional neural networks to color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data to investigate differences in the retina that may not be apparent through traditional human-based interpretations of retinal imaging. Retrospective data of CFP type 1 [posterior pole] and type 2 [optic nerve head (ONH)] from 369 and 336 participants respectively were analyzed. All participants had bilaterally normal optic nerves and maculae, with no retinal-involving diseases. CFP images were concatenated with OCT default ONH measurements, then inputted through three convolutional neural networks - VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. The primary outcome was performance of discriminating between with migraines versus without migraines, using retinal microvascular and neuronal imaging characteristics. Using CFP type 1 data, discrimination (AUC [95% CI]) was high (0.84 [0.8, 0.88] to 0.87 [0.84, 0.91]) and not significantly different between VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. Using CFP type 2 [ONH] data, discrimination was reduced and ranged from poor to fair (0.69 [0.62, 0.77] to 0.74 [0.67, 0.81]). OCT default ONH measurements overall did not significantly contribute to model performance. Class activation maps (CAMs) highlighted that the paravascular arcades were regions of interest. The findings suggest that individuals with migraines demonstrate microvascular differences more so than neuronal differences in comparison to individuals without migraines.</description>

      <title>RoCoSDF: Row-Column Scanned Neural Signed Distance Fields for Freehand 3D Ultrasound Imaging Shape Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of high-quality shape geometry is crucial for developing freehand 3D ultrasound imaging. However, the shape reconstruction of multi-view ultrasound data remains challenging due to the elevation distortion caused by thick transducer probes. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based framework RoCoSDF, which can effectively generate an implicit surface through continuous shape representations derived from row-column scanned datasets. In RoCoSDF, we encode the datasets from different views into the corresponding neural signed distance function (SDF) and then operate all SDFs in a normalized 3D space to restore the actual surface contour. Without requiring pre-training on large-scale ground truth shapes, our approach can synthesize a smooth and continuous signed distance field from multi-view SDFs to implicitly represent the actual geometry. Furthermore, two regularizers are introduced to facilitate shape refinement by constraining the SDF near the surface. The experiments on twelve shapes data acquired by two ultrasound transducer probes validate that RoCoSDF can effectively reconstruct accurate geometric shapes from multi-view ultrasound data, which outperforms current reconstruction methods. Code is available at https://github.com/chenhbo/RoCoSDF.</description>

      <title>Automated Retinal Image Analysis and Medical Report Generation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (2) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (3) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

      <title>Costal Cartilage Segmentation with Topology Guided Deformable Mamba: Method and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Costal cartilage segmentation is crucial to various medical applications, necessitating precise and reliable techniques due to its complex anatomy and the importance of accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach called topology-guided deformable Mamba (TGDM) for costal cartilage segmentation. The TGDM is tailored to capture the intricate long-range costal cartilage relationships. Our method leverages a deformable model that integrates topological priors to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of the segmentation process. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark that contains 165 cases for costal cartilage segmentation. This benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating costal cartilage segmentation techniques and provides a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments conducted on both in-domain benchmarks and out-of domain test sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods, showing significant improvements in segmentation precision and robustness.</description>

      <title>Improved 3D Whole Heart Geometry from Sparse CMR Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are two common non-invasive imaging methods for assessing patients with cardiovascular disease. CMR typically acquires multiple sparse 2D slices, with unavoidable respiratory motion artefacts between slices, whereas CT acquires isotropic dense data but uses ionising radiation. In this study, we explore the combination of Slice Shifting Algorithm (SSA), Spatial Transformer Network (STN), and Label Transformer Network (LTN) to: 1) correct respiratory motion between segmented slices, and 2) transform sparse segmentation data into dense segmentation. All combinations were validated using synthetic motion-corrupted CMR slice segmentation generated from CT in 1699 cases, where the dense CT serves as the ground truth. In 199 testing cases, SSA-LTN achieved the best results for Dice score and Huasdorff distance (94.0% and 4.7 mm respectively, average over 5 labels) but gave topological errors in 8 cases. STN was effective as a plug-in tool for correcting all topological errors with minimal impact on overall performance (93.5% and 5.0 mm respectively). SSA also proves to be a valuable plug-in tool, enhancing performance over both STN-based and LTN-based models. The code for these different combinations is available at https://github.com/XESchong/STACOM2024.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Practical Progress in Hyperspectral Pixel Unmixing with Large Spectral Libraries from a Sparse Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing is the process of determining the presence of individual materials and their respective abundances from an observed pixel spectrum. Unmixing is a fundamental process in hyperspectral image analysis, and is growing in importance as increasingly large spectral libraries are created and used. Unmixing is typically done with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. However, unmixing with large spectral libraries where the materials present in a pixel are not a priori known, solving for the coefficients in OLS requires inverting a non-invertible matrix from a large spectral library. A number of regression methods are available that can produce a numerical solution using regularization, but with considerably varied effectiveness. Also, simple methods that are unpopular in the statistics literature (i.e. step-wise regression) are used with some level of effectiveness in hyperspectral analysis. In this paper, we provide a thorough performance evaluation of the methods considered, evaluating methods based on how often they select the correct materials in the models. Investigated methods include ordinary least squares regression, non-negative least squares regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, step-wise regression and Bayesian model averaging. We evaluated these unmixing approaches using multiple criteria: incorporation of non-negative abundances, model size, accurate mineral detection and root mean squared error (RMSE). We provide a taxonomy of the regression methods, showing that most methods can be understood as Bayesian methods with specific priors. We conclude that methods that can be derived with priors that correspond to the phenomenology of hyperspectral imagery outperform those with priors that are optimal for prediction performance under the assumptions of ordinary least squares linear regression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important topic in computer vision with many relevant application in Earth observation. While supervised methods exist, the constraints of limited annotated data has encouraged development of unsupervised approaches. However, existing unsupervised methods resemble clustering and cannot be directly mapped to explicit target classes. In this paper, we deal with single shot semantic segmentation, where one example for the target class is provided, which is used to segment the target class from query/test images. Our approach exploits recently popular Segment Anything (SAM), a promptable foundation model. We specifically design several techniques to automatically generate prompts from the only example/key image in such a way that the segmentation is successfully achieved on a stitch or concatenation of the example/key and query/test images. Proposed technique does not involve any training phase and just requires one example image to grasp the concept. Furthermore, no text-based prompt is required for the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed techniques on building and car classes.</description>

      <title>GRFormer: Grouped Residual Self-Attention for Lightweight Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous works have shown that reducing parameter overhead and computations for transformer-based single image super-resolution (SISR) models (e.g., SwinIR) usually leads to a reduction of performance. In this paper, we present GRFormer, an efficient and lightweight method, which not only reduces the parameter overhead and computations, but also greatly improves performance. The core of GRFormer is Grouped Residual Self-Attention (GRSA), which is specifically oriented towards two fundamental components. Firstly, it introduces a novel grouped residual layer (GRL) to replace the Query, Key, Value (QKV) linear layer in self-attention, aimed at efficiently reducing parameter overhead, computations, and performance loss at the same time. Secondly, it integrates a compact Exponential-Space Relative Position Bias (ES-RPB) as a substitute for the original relative position bias to improve the ability to represent position information while further minimizing the parameter count. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based methods for $\times$2, $\times$3 and $\times$4 SISR tasks, notably outperforming SOTA by a maximum PSNR of 0.23dB when trained on the DIV2K dataset, while reducing the number of parameter and MACs by about \textbf{60\%} and \textbf{49\% } in only self-attention module respectively. We hope that our simple and effective method that can easily applied to SR models based on window-division self-attention can serve as a useful tool for further research in image super-resolution.

      <title>DIffSteISR: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Superior Real-world Stereo Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiffSteISR, a pioneering framework for reconstructing real-world stereo images. DiffSteISR utilizes the powerful prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained text-to-image model to efficiently recover the lost texture details in low-resolution stereo images. Specifically, DiffSteISR implements a time-aware stereo cross attention with temperature adapter (TASCATA) to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated left and right views exhibit high texture consistency thereby reducing disparity error between the super-resolved images and the ground truth (GT) images. Additionally, a stereo omni attention control network (SOA ControlNet) is proposed to enhance the consistency of super-resolved images with GT images in the pixel, perceptual, and distribution space. Finally, DiffSteISR incorporates a stereo semantic extractor (SSE) to capture unique viewpoint soft semantic information and shared hard tag semantic information, thereby effectively improving the semantic accuracy and consistency of the generated left and right images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffSteISR accurately reconstructs natural and precise textures from low-resolution stereo images while maintaining a high consistency of semantic and texture between the left and right views.</description>

      <title>DifuzCam: Replacing Camera Lens with a Mask and a Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flat lensless camera design reduces the camera size and weight significantly. In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging systems for improved reconstruction results.</description>

      <title>MedAugment: Universal Automatic Data Augmentation Plug-in for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) has been widely leveraged in computer vision to alleviate the data shortage, whereas the DA in medical image analysis (MIA) faces multiple challenges. The prevalent DA approaches in MIA encompass conventional DA, synthetic DA, and automatic DA. However, utilizing these approaches poses various challenges such as experience-driven design and intensive computation cost. Here, we propose an efficient and effective automatic DA method termed MedAugment. We propose a pixel augmentation space and spatial augmentation space and exclude the operations that can break medical details and features, such as severe color distortions or structural alterations that can compromise image diagnostic value. Besides, we propose a novel sampling strategy by sampling a limited number of operations from the two spaces. Moreover, we present a hyperparameter mapping relationship to produce a rational augmentation level and make the MedAugment fully controllable using a single hyperparameter. These configurations settle the differences between natural and medical images, such as high sensitivity to certain attributes such as brightness and posterize. Extensive experimental results on four classification and four segmentation datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedAugment. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed MedAugment serves as a more suitable yet general processing pipeline for medical images without producing color distortions or structural alterations and involving negligible computational overhead. We emphasize that our method can serve as a plugin for arbitrary projects without any extra training stage, thereby holding the potential to make a valuable contribution to the medical field, particularly for medical experts without a solid foundation in deep learning.

      <description>arXiv:2308.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function.The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level.In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the 'HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body' competition dataset.We propose adding switched auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models.Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset.The results supports the robustness of the proposed training methodology.The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis.The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network for Volume-to-mesh Reconstruction in Cardiovascular MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. However, conventional surface mesh generation methods, such as active shape models and multi-atlas segmentation, are highly time-consuming and require complex processing pipelines to generate simulation-ready 3D meshes. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multiview HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity and simulation ready meshes from CMR images.</description>

      <title>CSR-dMRI: Continuous Super-Resolution of Diffusion MRI with Anatomical Structure-assisted Implicit Neural Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based dMRI super-resolution methods can effectively enhance image resolution by leveraging the learning capabilities of neural networks on large datasets. However, these methods tend to learn a fixed scale mapping between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images, overlooking the need for radiologists to scale the images at arbitrary resolutions. Moreover, the pixel-wise loss in the image domain tends to generate over-smoothed results, losing fine textures and edge information. To address these issues, we propose a novel continuous super-resolution method for dMRI, called CSR-dMRI, which utilizes an anatomical structure-assisted implicit neural representation learning approach. Specifically, the CSR-dMRI model consists of two components. The first is the latent feature extractor, which primarily extracts latent space feature maps from LR dMRI and anatomical images while learning structural prior information from the anatomical images. The second is the implicit function network, which utilizes voxel coordinates and latent feature vectors to generate voxel intensities at corresponding positions. Additionally, a frequency-domain-based loss is introduced to preserve the structural and texture information, further enhancing the image quality. Extensive experiments on the publicly available HCP dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our method demonstrates superior generalization capability and can be applied to arbitrary-scale super-resolution, including non-integer scale factors, expanding its applicability beyond conventional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of data science into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has facilitated the evolution of these tools into complete spatial analysis platforms. The adoption of machine learning and big data techniques has equipped these platforms with the capacity to handle larger amounts of increasingly complex data, transcending the limitations of more traditional approaches. This work traces the historical and technical evolution of data science and GIS as fields of study, highlighting the critical points of convergence between domains, and underlining the many sectors that rely on this integration. A GIS application is presented as a case study in the disaster management sector where we utilize aerial data from Tr\'oia, Portugal, to emphasize the process of insight extraction from raw data. We conclude by outlining prospects for future research in integration of these fields in general, and the developed application in particular.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model for Medical Image Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation is a vital component in medical imaging processing, with many uses in a wide range of imaging modalities and clinical scenarios. Previous methods include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), which offer realism but suffer from instability and lack uncertainty estimation. Even though both GAN and DM methods have individually exhibited their capability in medical image translation tasks, the potential of combining a GAN and DM to further improve translation performance and to enable uncertainty estimation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a Cascade Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model (CMDM) for high-quality medical image translation and uncertainty estimation. To reduce the required number of iterations and ensure robust performance, our method first obtains a conditional GAN-generated prior image that will be used for the efficient reverse translation with a DM in the subsequent step. Additionally, a multi-path shortcut diffusion strategy is employed to refine translation results and estimate uncertainty. A cascaded pipeline further enhances translation quality, incorporating residual averaging between cascades. We collected three different medical image datasets with two sub-tasks for each dataset to test the generalizability of our approach. Our experimental results found that CMDM can produce high-quality translations comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing reasonable uncertainty estimations that correlate well with the translation error.</description>

      <title>SSL-SoilNet: A Hybrid Transformer-based Framework with Self-Supervised Learning for Large-scale Soil Organic Carbon Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) constitutes a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystem functionality, playing a pivotal role in nutrient cycling, hydrological balance, and erosion mitigation. Precise mapping of SOC distribution is imperative for the quantification of ecosystem services, notably carbon sequestration and soil fertility enhancement. Digital soil mapping (DSM) leverages statistical models and advanced technologies, including machine learning (ML), to accurately map soil properties, such as SOC, utilizing diverse data sources like satellite imagery, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate series. Within the domain of ML, self-supervised learning (SSL), which exploits unlabeled data, has gained prominence in recent years. This study introduces a novel approach that aims to learn the geographical link between multimodal features via self-supervised contrastive learning, employing pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) for image inputs and Transformers for climate data, before fine-tuning the model with ground reference samples. The proposed approach has undergone rigorous testing on two distinct large-scale datasets, with results indicating its superiority over traditional supervised learning models, which depends solely on labeled data. Furthermore, through the utilization of various evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, CCC, etc.), the proposed model exhibits higher accuracy when compared to other conventional ML algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting. This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and contributes to the advancement of DSM techniques, thereby facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</description>

Abstract: The acquisition of objects outside the Line-of-Sight of cameras is a very intriguing but also extremely challenging research topic. Recent works showed the feasibility of this idea exploiting transient imaging data produced by custom direct Time of Flight sensors. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle this problem using only data from an off-the-shelf indirect Time of Flight sensor without any further hardware requirement. We introduced a Deep Learning model able to re-frame the surfaces where light bounces happen as a virtual mirror. This modeling makes the task easier to handle and also facilitates the construction of annotated training data. From the obtained data it is possible to retrieve the depth information of the hidden scene. We also provide a first-in-its-kind synthetic dataset for the task and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea over it.</description>
