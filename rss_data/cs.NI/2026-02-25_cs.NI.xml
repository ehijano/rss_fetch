      <title>AWCP: A Workspace Delegation Protocol for Deep-Engagement Collaboration across Remote Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents is reshaping the digital landscape toward an emerging Agentic Web, where increasingly specialized agents must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. However, existing collaboration paradigms are constrained to message passing, leaving execution environments as isolated silos. This creates a context gap: agents cannot directly manipulate files or invoke tools in a peer's environment, and must instead resort to costly, error-prone environment reconstruction. We introduce the Agent Workspace Collaboration Protocol (AWCP), which bridges this gap through temporary workspace delegation inspired by the Unix philosophy that everything is a file. AWCP decouples a lightweight control plane from pluggable transport mechanisms, allowing a Delegator to project its workspace to a remote Executor, who then operates on the shared files directly with unmodified local toolchains. We provide a fully open-source reference implementation with MCP tool integration and validate the protocol through live demonstrations of asymmetric collaboration, where agents with complementary capabilities cooperate through delegated workspaces. By establishing the missing workspace layer in the agentic protocol stack, AWCP paves the way for a universally interoperable agent ecosystem in which collaboration transcends message boundaries. The protocol and reference implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/SII-Holos/awcp.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Block Coordinate Descent for Downlink Weighted Sum-rate Maximization on AI-Native Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based block coordinate descent (DRL-based BCD) algorithm to address the nonconvex weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem with a total power constraint. Firstly, we present an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We then integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques into the BCD method and propose the DRL-based BCD algorithm. This approach combines the data-driven learning capability of machine learning techniques with the navigational and decision-making characteristics of the optimization-theoretic-based BCD method. This combination significantly improves the algorithm's performance by reducing its sensitivity to initial points and mitigating the risk of entrapment in local optima. The primary advantages of the proposed DRL-based BCD algorithm lie in its ability to adhere to the constraints of the WSRM problem and significantly enhance accuracy, potentially achieving the exact optimal solution. Moreover, unlike many pure machine-learning approaches, the DRL-based BCD algorithm capitalizes on the underlying theoretical analysis of the WSRM problem's structure. This enables it to be easily trained and computationally efficient while maintaining a level of interpretability. Through numerical experiments, the DRL-based BCD algorithm demonstrates substantial advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability for maximizing sum rates, which also provides valuable potential for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Airavat: An Agentic Framework for Internet Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet measurement faces twin challenges: complex analyses require expert-level orchestration of tools, yet even syntactically correct implementations can have methodological flaws and can be difficult to verify. Democratizing measurement capabilities thus demands automating both workflow generation and verification against methodological standards established through decades of research.
  We present Airavat, the first agentic framework for Internet measurement workflow generation with systematic verification and validation. Airavat coordinates a set of agents mirroring expert reasoning: three agents handle problem decomposition, solution design, and code implementation, with assistance from a registry of existing tools. Two specialized engines ensure methodological correctness: a Verification Engine evaluates workflows against a knowledge graph encoding five decades of measurement research, while a Validation Engine identifies appropriate validation techniques grounded in established methodologies. Through four Internet measurement case studies, we demonstrate that Airavat (i) generates workflows matching expert-level solutions, (ii) makes sound architectural decisions, (iii) addresses novel problems without ground truth, and (iv) identifies methodological flaws missed by standard execution-based testing.</description>

      <title>Telemetry-Based Server Selection in the Quantum Internet via Cross-Layer Runtime Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet will allow clients to delegate quantum workloads to remote servers over heterogeneous networks, but choosing the server that minimizes end-to-end execution time is difficult because server processing, feedforward classical communication, and entanglement distribution can overlap in protocol-dependent ways and shift the runtime bottleneck. We propose $T_{\max}$, a lightweight runtime score that sums coarse telemetry from multiple layers to obtain a conservative ranking for online server selection without calibrating weights for each deployment. Using NetSquid discrete-event simulations of a modified parameter-blind VQE (PB-VQE) workload, we evaluate $T_{\max}$ on pools of 10,000 heterogeneous candidates (selecting among up to 100 per decision) across crossover and bottleneck-dominated regimes, including temporal jitter scenarios and jobs with multiple shots. $T_{\max}$ achieves single-digit mean regret normalized by the oracle (below 10%) in both regimes and remains in the single-digit range under classical communication latency jitter for multi-shot jobs, while performance degrades for single-shot jobs under severe jitter. To connect performance to deployment planning, we derive an operating map based on requirements relating distance and entanglement rate requirements to protocol level counts, quantify how simple multiuser contention shifts the crossover, and use Sobol global sensitivity analysis to identify regime-dependent bottlenecks. These findings suggest that simple cross-layer telemetry can enable practical server selection while providing actionable provisioning guidance for emerging Quantum Internet services.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Future Connectivity: A Contemporary Survey on AI-empowered Satellite-based Non-Terrestrial Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are expected to be a critical component of 6th Generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous, continuous, and scalable services. Satellites emerge as the primary enabler for NTN, leveraging their extensive coverage, stable orbits, scalability, and adherence to international regulations. However, satellite-based NTN presents unique challenges, including long propagation delay, high Doppler shift, frequent handovers, spectrum sharing complexities, and intricate beam and resource allocation, among others. The integration of NTNs into existing terrestrial networks in 6G introduces a range of novel challenges, including task offloading, network routing, network slicing, and many more. To tackle all these obstacles, this paper proposes Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a promising solution, harnessing its ability to capture intricate correlations among diverse network parameters. We begin by providing a comprehensive background on NTN and AI, highlighting the potential of AI techniques in addressing various NTN challenges. Next, we present an overview of existing works, emphasizing AI as an enabling tool for satellite-based NTN, and explore potential research directions. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing research efforts that aim to enable AI in satellite-based NTN through software-defined implementations, while also discussing the associated challenges. Finally, we conclude by providing insights and recommendations for enabling AI-driven satellite-based NTN in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>FastReChain: A Novel Bidirectional Model-Based Algorithm for Topology Engineering of OCS-Based Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) technology is increasingly being adopted in data centers due to its advantages of low power consumption and low technology refresh costs. Unlike electrical packet switches, OCS provides programmable bandwidth for directly connected devices by configuring the mapping relationships of internal ports. Thus, how to calculate these internal port mapping relationships, i.e., Topology Engineering (ToE), is one of the key designs of OCS-based clusters.
  Current deployments usually design ToE algorithms by solving Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models, with the aim of minimizing modifications to links occupied by running tasks as much as possible. However, ILP-based ToE algorithms may incur excessive runtime overhead in large-scale clusters. Some existing ToE algorithms convert the ILP model into a Minimum-Cost Flow model through greedy construction, yet such greedy strategies may increase the number of affected links during the OCS reconfiguration process. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel bidirectional modeling approach, along with a corresponding FastReChain algorithm in this paper. We verify the superiority of this algorithm through simulation experiments based on real-trace data.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decision Mamba Meets Agentic AI: A Novel Approach for RAN Slicing in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.</description>
