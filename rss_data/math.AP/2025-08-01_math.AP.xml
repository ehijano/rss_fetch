      <title>Mean-field approximation, Gibbs relaxation, and cross estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the propagation of chaos and the relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. While it is known that propagation of chaos holds at rate $O(N^{-1})$ uniformly in time, and Gibbs relaxation at rate $O(e^{-ct})$ uniformly in $N$, we go a step further by showing that the cross error between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. For translation-invariant systems on the torus, this leads to an improved mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density: the error decreases from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. We also derive new results on Gibbs relaxation and present partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <title>A note on the first Steklov eigenvalue on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the first positive Steklov eigenvalue on planar domains. First, we provide an example of a planar domain for which a first eigenfunction has a closed nodal line. Second, we establish a lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue on certain symmetric domains and show that this eigenvalue is simple for all ellipses. These results complement two statements contained in a work by Kuttler and Sigillito (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 20, 1969).</description>

      <title>On the existence of normalized solutions to a class of fractional Choquard equation with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of normalized solutions to the nonlinear fractional Choquard equation: $$ (-\Delta)^s u+V(x) u=\lambda u+f(x)\left(I_\alpha *\left(f|u|^q\right)\right)|u|^{q-2} u+g(x)\left(I_\alpha *\left(g|u|^p\right)\right)|u|^{p-2} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N $$ subject to the mass constraint $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2 d x=a&gt;0, $$ where $N&gt;2 s, s \in(0,1), \alpha \in(0, N)$, and $\frac{N+\alpha}{N} \leq q&lt;p \leq \frac{N+\alpha+2 s}{N}$. Here, the parameter $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ appears as an unknown Lagrange multiplier associated with the normalization condition. By employing variational methods under appropriate assumptions on the potentials $V(x), f(x)$, and $g(x)$, we establish several existence results for normalized solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenisation for differential equations with highly anisotropic partially degenerating coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-uniformly elliptic second-order differential operator with periodic coefficients that models composite media consisting of highly anisotropic cylindrical fibres periodically distributed in an isotropic background. The degree of anisotropy is related to the period of the coefficients via a `critical' high-contrast scaling. In particular, ellipticity is lost in certain directions as the period, $\epsilon$, tends to zero. Our primary interest is in the asymptotic behaviour of the resolvent of this operator in the limit of small $\epsilon$.
  Two-scale resolvent convergence results were established for such operators in Cherednichenko, Smyshlyaev and Zhikov (Proceedings of The Royal Society of Edinburgh:Seciton A Mathematics. 136(1), 87--114(2006)). In this work, we provide an asymptotic description of the resolvent and establish operator-type error estimates. Our approach adopts the general scheme of Cooper, Kamotski and Smyshlyaev (preprint available at arXiv:2307.13151). However, we face new challenges such as a directional dependence on the loss of ellipticity in addition to a key `spectral gap' assumption of the above article only holding in a weaker sense. This results in an additional `interfacial' boundary layer analysis in the vicinity of each fibre to arrive at order-$\epsilon$ operator-type error estimates.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering for the 2D modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem associated with the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation over $\mathbb{R}^2$. Taking into consideration the associated dispersive effects, we introduce, for $s,a\ge 0$, a two-parameter space $H^{s,a}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, which scales as the classic $H^s$ spaces. In this new class, we prove local well-posedness for $s+a\ge 1/4$, $0&lt;a&lt;1/4$, and global well-posedness and scattering for small data in the case $s=0, \ a=1/4$. These results are shown to be sharp in the sense of $C^3$-flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that if the sequence $(p_j(x))$ increases uniformly to $p(x)$ in a bounded, smooth domain $\Omega$, then the sequence $(u_i)$ of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the $p_i(x)$-Laplacian with fixed boundary datum $\varphi$ converges (in a sense to be made precise) to the solution $u_p$ of the Dirichlet problem for the $p(x)$-Laplacian with boundary datum $\varphi$. A similar result is proved for a decreasing sequence $p_j\searrow p$</description>

      <title>Heat content asymptotics for sets with positive reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the heat content for sets with positive reach. In details, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the heat content of bounded subsets of the Euclidean space with positive reach. The concept of positive reach was introduced by Federer in \cite{fed_1959} and widely developed in the following years (see for instance the recent book by Rataj and Zh{\"a}le \cite{rat_zah_2019}). It extends the class of sets with smooth boundaries to include certain non-smooth and singular sets while still admitting a well-defined normal geometry. For such sets $E\subseteq\Rn$, we analyze the short-time asymptotics of the heat content $\|T_t\mathbbm{1}_E\|_2$, where $T_t\mathbbm{1}_E$ is the soluzion of the heat equation in $\Rn$ with initial condition $\mathbbm{1}_E$. The present paper is in the spirit of Angiuli, Massari and Miranda Jr.\cite{ang_mas_mir_2013}, but the technique's used here are completely different and also the final result is slightly different.</description>

      <title>Improvement of the Parabolic Regularization Method and Applications to Dispersive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Benjamin Ono equation is globally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s &gt; 1/2$. Our approach does not rely on the global gauge transformation introduced by Tao (arXiv:math/0307289). Instead, we employ a modified version of the standard parabolic regularization method. In particular, this technique also enables us to establish global well-posedness, in the same Sobolev space, for the dispersion-generalized Benjamin Ono (DGBO) equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider finite-time and $k$-equivariant solutions to the harmonic map heat flow from $B^2$ to $S^2$ under general time-dependent boundary data and prove that the bubble tree decomposition contains only one bubble. The method relies on the Maximum and Comparison Principle. We also exhibit solutions blowing up in infinite time for any $k \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Elliptic unique continuation below the Lipschitz threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate unique continuation principles for solutions $u$ of uniformly elliptic equations of the form $-\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u) = 0$ when $A$ is less regular than Lipschitz. For general matrices $A$, we prove that strong unique continuation holds provided that $A$ has modulus of continuity $\omega$ satisfying the Osgood condition $\int_0^1 \omega(t)^{-1}dt = \infty$, plus some other mild hypotheses. Along with the counterexamples of Mandache, this shows that the sharp condition on $A$ that guarantees unique continuation is essentially that $A$ is log-Lipschitz. In the class of isotropic equations (i.e., $A(x) = a(x)I$ for some scalar function $a$) we show that Holder continuity of $a$ of the order $\alpha \in (2/3,1)$ is sufficient to guarantee strong unique continuation. This latter result contrasts counterexamples known for anisotropic equations, and disproves a conjecture of Miller from 1974.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study normalized solutions for the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with potential and Sobolev critical nonlinearity. By establishing suitable assumptions on the potential, together with new techniques, we find a mountain-pass type solution for N&gt;=6, which solves an open problem presented in a recent paper [Verzini and Yu, arXiv:2505.05357v1]. Moreover, we also find a local minimizer with negative energy for N&gt;=3, which improves the results in [Verzini and Yu, arXiv:2505.05357v1].</description>

      <title>Infinite BV, large $L^\infty$ solutions of conservation laws are H\"older-stable in $L^2$ in the class of front tracking limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one spatial dimension. For any limit of front tracking solutions $v$, and for a general weak solution $u\in L^\infty$ with no BV assumption, we prove the following H\"older-type stability estimate in $L^2$:
  $$||u(\cdot,\tau)-v(\cdot,\tau)||_{L^2} \leq K \sqrt{||u( \cdot,0)-v( \cdot,0)||_{L^2}}$$
  for all $\tau$ without smallness and for a universal constant $K$. Our result holds for all limits of front tracking solutions $v$ with BV bound, either for general systems with small-BV data, or for special systems (isothermal Euler, Temple-class systems) with large-BV data. Our results apply to physical systems such as isentropic Euler. The stability estimate is completely independent of the BV norm of the potentially very wild solution $u$. We use the $L^2$ theory of shock stability modulo an artificial shift of position (Vasseur [Handbook of Differential Equations: Evolutionary Equations, 4:323 -- 376, 2008]) but our stability results do not depend on an unknown shift. Moreover, we give the first result within this framework which can show uniqueness of some solutions with large $L^\infty$ and infinite BV initial data. We apply these techniques to isothermal Euler.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Cross-Nonlinear Porous-Medium System Modeling Pressure-Driven Cell Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a cross-diffusion model that couples population density and occupied area to investigate how internal pressure drives growth and motility. By blending nonlinear nonlocal interactions with porous-medium diffusion and an antidiffusive pressure term, the model captures the two-way feedback between local density fluctuations and tissue expansion or contraction. Building on Shraiman's area-growth paradigm, we enrich the framework with density-dependent spreading at the population boundary and a novel cross-diffusion term, yielding fully nonlinear transport in both equations. We prove local well-posedness for nonnegative solutions in Sobolev spaces and, under higher regularity, show both density and area remain nonnegative. Uniqueness follows when the initial density's square root lies in $H^2$, even if density vanishes on parts of the domain. We also exhibit initial data that induce finite-time blow-up, highlighting potential singularity formation. Finally, we establish that the density's spatial support remains invariant and characterize the co-evolution of occupied area and population density domains, offering new insights into pattern formation and mass transport in biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Approximation of time-periodic flow past a translating body by flows in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-periodic incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow past a translating rigid body. In the first part of the paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in the exterior domain $\Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^3$ that satisfy pointwise estimates for both the velocity and pressure. The fundamental solution of the time-periodic Oseen equations plays a central role in obtaining these estimates. The second part focuses on approximating this exterior flow within truncated domains $\Omega \cap B_R$, incorporating appropriate artificial boundary conditions on $\partial B_R$. For these bounded domain problems, we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. Finally, we estimate the error in the velocity component as a function of the truncation radius $R$, showing that, as $R \to \infty$, the velocities of the truncated problems converge, in an appropriate norm, to the velocity of the exterior flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of molecules with an octahedral configuration, with particular focus on sulfur hexafluoride SF6. Under the assumption of isotypic nonresonance, we apply the method of equivariant gradient degree to prove the existence of branches of periodic solutions emerging from the critical orbit of equilibrium, corresponding to at least 16 distinct types of symmetries with maximal orbit kinds. Numerical animations are presented to illustrate the detected vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of singular SPDEs with Correlated Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show local well-posedness of the g-PAM and the $\phi^{K+1}_2$-equation for $K\geq 1$ on the two-dimensional torus when the coefficient field is random and correlated to the driving noise. In the setting considered here, even when the model in the sense of [Hai14] is stationary, naive use of renormalisation constants in general leads to variance blow-up. Instead, we prove convergence of renormalised models choosing random renormalisation functions analogous to the deterministic variable coefficient setting. The main technical contribution are stochastic estimates on the model in this correlated setting which are obtained by a combination of heat kernel asymptotics, Gaussian integration by parts formulae and Hairer--Quastel type bounds [HQ18].</description>

      <title>H\"older continuous dissipative solutions of ideal MHD with nonzero helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of weak solutions to the 3D ideal MHD equations, of class $C^\alpha$ with $\alpha=10^{-8}$, for which the total energy and the cross helicity (i.e., the so-called Els\"asser energies) are not conserved. The solutions do not possess any symmetry properties and the magnetic helicity, which is necessarily conserved for H\"older continuous solutions, is nonzero. The construction, which works both on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with compact spatial support, is based on a novel convex integration scheme in which the magnetic helicity is preserved at each step. This is the first construction of continuous weak solutions at a regularity level where one conservation law (here, the magnetic helicity) is necessarily preserved while another (here, the total energy or cross helicity) is not, and where the preservation of the former is nontrivial in the sense that it does not follow from symmetry considerations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains some embedded minimal surface of genus 2.
  We also establish a theorem for more general 3-manifolds that relates the existence of genus $g$ minimal surfaces to topological properties regarding the set of all embedded singular surfaces of genus $\leq g$.</description>

      <title>Matching Large Deviation Bounds of the Zero-Range Process in the whole space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the large deviations of the hydrodynamic rescaling of the zero-range process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in any dimension $d\ge 1$. Under mild and canonical hypotheses on the local jump rate, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds, thus resolving the problem opened by \cite{KL99}. On the probabilistic side, we extend the superexponential estimate to any dimension, and prove the superexponential concentration on paths with finite entropy dissipation. In addition, we extend the theory of the parabolic-hyperbolic skeleton equation to the whole space, and remove global convexity/concavity assumptions on the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Derivations of two one-dimensional models for transversely curved shallow shells: one leads to relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\Gamma$-limit of sequences of variational problems for straight, transversely curved shallow shells, as the width of the planform $\varepsilon$ goes to zero.
  The energy is of von K\'arm\'an type for shallow shells under suitable boundary conditions. What distinguishes the various regimes is the scaling of the stretching energy $\sim \varepsilon^{2\beta}$, with $\beta$ a positive number. We derive two one-dimensional models as $\beta$ ranges in $(0, 2]$. Remarkably, boundary conditions are essential to get compactness.
  We show that for $\beta \in (0, 2)$ the $\Gamma$-limit leads to relaxation: the limit membrane energy vanishes on compression. For $\beta=2$ there is no relaxation, and the limit model is a nonlinear energy coupling four kinematical descriptors in a nontrivial way.
  As special cases of the latter limit model, a nonlinear Vlasov torsion theory and a nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory can be deduced.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Inverse Problems by Filtered Diagonal Frame Decomposition under general source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be Hilbert spaces, and $\mathbf{K}: \text{dom} \mathbf{K} \subset X \to Y$ a bounded linear operator. This paper addresses the inverse problem $\mathbf{K}x = y$, where exact data $y$ is replaced by noisy data $y^\delta$ satisfying $\|y^\delta - y\|_Y \leq \delta$. Due to the ill-posedness of such problems, we employ regularization methods to stabilize solutions. While singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a classical approach, its computation can be costly and impractical for certain operators. We explore alternatives via Diagonal Frame Decomposition (DFD), generalizing SVD-based techniques, and introduce a regularized solution $x^\delta_\alpha = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \kappa_\lambda g_\alpha(\kappa_\lambda^2) \langle y^\delta, v_\lambda \rangle \overline{u}_\lambda$. Convergence rates and optimality are analyzed under a generalized source condition $\mathbf{M}_{\varphi, E} = \{ x \in \text{dom} \mathbf{K} : \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} [\varphi(\kappa_\lambda^2)]^{-1} |\langle x, u_\lambda \rangle|^2 \leq E^2 \}$. Key questions include constructing DFD systems, relating DFD and SVD singular values, and extending source conditions. We present theoretical results, including modulus of continuity bounds and convergence rates for a priori and a posteriori parameter choices, with applications to polynomial and exponentially ill-posed problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of positive solutions for certain weakly coupled elliptic systems of sublinear growth under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our findings generalize existing results related to sublinear systems involving two weakly coupled equations, such as the Lane-Emden systems. Moreover, our results apply to both bounded domains and thin unbounded domains, defined as unbounded regions contained between two parallel hyperplanes, and accommodate some discontinuous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with Surface Tension in Compressible Ideal MHD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-vortex sheet is one of the characteristic discontinuities in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The motion of current-vortex sheets is described by a free-interface problem of two-phase MHD flows with magnetic fields tangential to the interface. This paper is the first part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for compressible current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension. In this paper, we prove the local well-posedness and the incompressible limit of current-vortex sheets with surface tension. The key observation is a hidden structure of Lorentz force in the vorticity analysis which motivates us to establish the uniform estimates in anisotropic-type Sobolev spaces with weights of Mach number determined by the number of tangential derivatives. Besides, our framework of iteration and approximation to prove the local existence of vortex-sheet problems does not rely on Nash-Moser iteration. Furthermore, the local existence of current-vortex sheets without surface tension can be proved by taking zero-surface-tension limit under certain stability conditions, which is established in [73] (the second part of the two-paper sequence).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by manifold-constrained homogenization problems, we construct suitable extensions for Sobolev functions defined on a perforated domain and taking values in a compact, connected $C^2$-manifold without boundary. The proof combines a by now classical extension result for the unconstrained case with a retraction argument that heavily relies on the topological properties of the manifold. With the ultimate goal of providing necessary conditions for the existence of extensions for Sobolev maps between manifolds, we additionally investigate the relationship between this problem and the surjectivity of the trace operator for such functions.</description>

      <title>RG approach to the inviscid limit for shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an initial value problem for shell models that mimic turbulent velocity fluctuations over a geometric sequence of scales. Our goal is to study the convergence of solutions in the inviscid (more generally, vanishing regularization) limit and explain the universality of both the limiting solutions and the convergence process. We develop a renormalization group (RG) formalism representing this limit as dynamics in a space of flow maps. For the dyadic shell model, the RG dynamics has a fixed-point attractor, which determines universal limiting solutions. Deviations from the limiting solutions are also universal and given by a leading eigenmode (eigenvalue and eigenvector) of the linearized RG operator. Application to the Gledzer shell model reveals the RG attractor in the form of a closed invariant curve, while the Sabra shell model yields chaotic RG dynamics. An important consequence of the RG formalism is the understanding of the different roles of symmetry-preserving (canonical) and symmetry-breaking (e.g. viscous) regularizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of shock profiles in one spatial dimension for the isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson (NSP) system, which describes the dynamics of ions in a collision-dominated plasma. The NSP system admits a one-parameter family of smooth traveling waves, called shock profiles, for a given far-field condition satisfying the Lax entropy condition. In this paper, we prove that if the initial data is sufficiently close to a shock profile in $H^2$-norm, then the global solution of the Cauchy problem tends to the smooth manifold formed by the parametrized shock profiles as time goes to infinity. This is achieved using the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, which does not require the zero mass condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates uniform well-posedness and inviscid limit behavior for the periodic Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdV-B) and modified Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (mKdV-B) equations: \[ \partial_t u + \partial_x^3 u - \varepsilon \partial_x^2 u = \partial_x(u^\alpha), \quad u(0) = \phi, \] where $\alpha = 2, 3$, $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $u : \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{R}$ is real-valued.
  For the KdV-B equation ($\alpha=2$), we establish unconditional uniform global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s \geq 0$, uniformly for all $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$, without relying on auxiliary function spaces. Furthermore, we prove that for any $s \geq 0$, there exists $T &gt; 0$ such that solutions converge in $C([0,T]; H^s)$ to those of the KdV equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$. For the mKdV-B equation ($\alpha=3$), we establish analogous results--unconditional uniform well-posedness and inviscid limit behavior in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s \geq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Finite time blowup for Keller-Segel equation with logistic damping in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Keller-Segel equation, a classical chemotaxis model, and many of its variants have been extensively studied for decades. In this work, we focus on 3D Keller-Segel equation with a quadratic logistic damping term $-\mu \rho^2$ (modeling density-dependent mortality rate) and show the existence of finite-time blowup solutions with nonnegative density and finite mass for any $\mu \in \big[0,\frac{1}{3}\big)$. This range of $\mu$ is sharp; for $\mu \ge \frac{1}{3}$, the logistic damping effect suppresses the blowup as shown in [Kang-Stevens, 2016] and [Tello-Winkler, 2007]. A key ingredient is to construct a self-similar blowup solution to a related aggregation equation as an approximate solution, with subcritical scaling relative to the original model. Based on this construction, we employ a robust weighted $L^2$ method to prove the stability of this approximate solution, where modulation ODEs are introduced to enforce local vanishing conditions for the perturbation lying in a singular-weighted $L^2$ space. As a byproduct, we exhibit a new family of type I blowup mechanisms for the classical 3D Keller-Segel equation.</description>

      <title>On spatial decay for coherent states of the Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation
  $$\partial_t u - H \partial_x^2 u = -\partial_x(u^2)$$
  that are localized in a reference frame moving to the right with constant speed. We show that any such solution that decays at least like $\langle x\rangle^{-1-\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$ in a comoving coordinate frame must in fact decay like $\langle x\rangle^{-2}$. In view of the explicit soliton solutions, this decay rate is sharp. Our proof has two main ingredients. The first is microlocal dispersive estimates for the Benjamin-Ono equation in a moving frame, which allow us to prove spatial decay of the solution provided the nonlinearity has sufficient decay. The second is a careful normal form analysis, which allows us to obtain rapid decay of the nonlinearity for a transformed equation assuming only modest decay of the solution. Our arguments are entirely time dependent, and do not require the solution to be an exact traveling wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an $(\epsilon,\delta,D)$-domain, with $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $\delta\in(0,\infty]$, and $D\subset \partial \Omega$ being a closed part of $\partial \Omega$, which is a general open connected set when $D=\partial \Omega$ and an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-domain when $D=\emptyset$. Let $s\in(0,1)$ and $p\in[1,\infty)$. If ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, ${\mathcal W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, and $\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$ are the fractional Sobolev spaces on $\Omega$ that are defined respectively via the restriction of $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\Omega$, the intrinsic Gagliardo norm, and the completion of all $C^\infty(\Omega)$ functions with compact support away from $D$, in this article we prove their equivalences [that is, ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)={\mathcal{W}}^{s,p}(\Omega) =\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$] if $\Omega$ supports a $D$-adapted fractional Hardy inequality and, moreover, when $sp\ne 1$ such a fractional Hardy inequality is shown to be necessary to guarantee these equivalences under some mild geometric conditions on $\Omega$. Using the aforementioned equivalences, we show that the real interpolation space $(L^p(\Omega), \mathring{W}_D^{1,p}(\Omega))_{s,p}$ equals to some weighted fractional order Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$ when $p\in (1,\infty)$. Applying this to the elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}_D$ in $\Omega$ with mixed boundary condition, we characterize both the domain of its fractional power and the parabolic maximal regularity of its Cauchy initial problem by means of $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find normalized solutions to the following Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation}\notag \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u-\frac{\mu}{|x|^2}h(x)u+\lambda u =f(u)\quad\text{in}\quad\mathbb{R}^{N},\\ &amp; u&gt;0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}u^2dx=a^2, \end{aligned} \end{equation} where $N\geq3$, $a&gt;0$ is fixed, $f$ satisfies mass-subcritical growth conditions and $h$ is a given bounded function with $||h||_\infty\le 1$. The $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$-norm of $u$ is fixed and $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. Our solutions are constructed by minimizing the corresponding energy functional on a suitable constraint. Due to the presence of a possibly nonradial term $h$, establishing compactness becomes challenging. To address this difficulty, we employ the splitting lemma to exclude both the vanishing and the dichotomy of a given any minimizing sequence for appropriate $a &gt; 0$.
  Furthermore, we show that if $h$ is radial, then radial solutions can be obtained for any $a&gt;0$. In this case, the radial symmetry allows us to prove that such solutions converge to a ground state solution of the limit problem as $\mu \to 0^+$.</description>

      <title>Introduction to SPDEs from Probability and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lecture notes accompanying an 8hr hour mini-course on SPDE given at Bo\u{g}azi\c{c}i University, Istanbul in June/July 2025. They are based on earlier notes of a shorter mini-course given at the University of Oxford in 2021. The main focus of these notes is on an exposition of the variational method for monotone and coercive SPDE. A recap of the necessary functional analysis, operator theory and stochastic analysis on Hilbert spaces is included, with additional references. The final chapter contains a discussion of the pathwise approach.</description>

      <title>Sharp Weighted Cohen--Dahmen--Daubechies--DeVore Inequality with Applications to (Weighted) Critical Sobolev Spaces, Gagliardo--Nirenberg Inequalities, and Muckenhoupt Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a quantitative weighted variant of a far-reaching inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore in 2003, whose dependence on the $A_p$-weight constant for any $p\in[1,\infty)$ is sharp. As applications, we obtain the almost characterization of the critical weighted Sobolev space in terms of wavelets, a sharp real interpolation between this weighted Sobolev space and weighted Besov spaces, and three new Gagliardo--Nirenberg type inequalities in the framework of ball Banach function spaces. Moreover, we apply this sharp weighted inequality to extend the famous Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung formula in ball Banach function spaces, which gives an affirmative answer to the question in page 29 of [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023), Paper No. 234]. Notably, we further establish two new characterizations of Muckenhoupt weights related to the inequality of Cohen et al.\ and the formula of Brezis et al. The most novelty of this article exists in applying and further developing the good cube method introduced by Cohen et al.\ to trace the sharp dependences on weight constants.</description>

      <title>Existence of 5 minimal tori in 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1989, B. White conjectured that every Riemannian 3-sphere has at least 5 embedded minimal tori. We confirm this conjecture for 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature. While our proof uses min-max theory, the underlying heuristics are largely inspired by mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>An Atomic Representation for Bicomplex Hardy Classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop representations for bicomplex-valued functions in Hardy classes that generalize the complex holomorphic Hardy spaces. Using these representations, we show these functions have boundary values in the sense of distributions that are representable by an atomic decomposition, and we show continuity of the Hilbert transform on this class of distributional boundary values.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young drivers I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper (alongside its companion, Part II \cite{BSDEYoung-II}) investigates backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise.
  Assuming the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs via a modified Picard iteration method. We then derive a comparison principle by analyzing the associated linear BSDEs and establish regularity properties of the solutions. As an application, we obtain Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of linear stochastic heat equations subject to Neumann boundary conditions.</description>
