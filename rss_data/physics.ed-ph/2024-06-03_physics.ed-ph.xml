      <title>Educational Perspectives on Quaternions: Insights and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternions, discovered by Sir William Rowan Hamilton in the 19th century, are a significant extension of complex numbers and a profound tool for understanding three-dimensional rotations. This work explores the quaternion's history, algebraic structure, and educational implications. We begin with the historical context of quaternions, highlighting Hamilton's contributions and the development of quaternion theory. This sets the stage for a detailed examination of quaternion algebra, including their representations as complex numbers, matrices, and non-commutative nature. Our research presents some advancements compared to previous educational studies by thoroughly examining quaternion applications in rotations. We differentiate between left and right rotations through detailed numerical examples and propose a general approach to rotations via a theorem, clearly defining the associated morphism. This framework enhances the understanding of the algebraic structure of quaternions. A key innovation is presenting a three-dimensional example illustrating the rotation of a frame with strings, connecting quaternions to the quaternion group, half-integer spin phenomena, and Pauli matrices. This approach bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications, enriching the understanding of quaternions in scientific contexts. We emphasize the importance of incorporating the history and applications of quaternions into educational curricula to enhance student comprehension and interest. By integrating historical context and practical examples, we aim to make complex mathematical concepts more accessible and engaging for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our study underscores the enduring relevance of quaternions in various scientific and technological fields and highlights the potential for future research and educational innovations.</description>

      <title>How to design research-aligned DEI interventions in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides resources to design effective diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) interventions in physics settings. It summarizes critiques of DEI interventions and reviews research findings suggesting that DEI interventions show modest but positive benefits. It covers physics-specific concerns around DEI (resistance from skeptical participants, unintended negative consequences for members of minoritized groups). The article then explores six design questions: 1) What are the intended outcomes of the intervention? (with a list of possible outcomes) 2) How will the intervention be justified to participants? 3) Will the intervention be voluntary or required? 4) Who will the participants be? 5) What activities will the intervention consist of? (with suggested activities paired to outcomes) 6) How will you know whether the intervention worked? (with tools used by other researchers to measure particular outcomes, and bonus suggestions for how to carry out publication-worthy evaluations). Each question is explored using research results and recommendations, and illustrated using examples from physics and other STEM settings.</description>

      <title>Using EEG to investigate the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16687v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</description>
