      <title>Complexity of adaptive testing in scenarios defined extensionally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a testing setting where the set of possible definitions of the Implementation Under Test (IUT), as well as the behavior of each of these definitions in all possible interactions, are extensionally defined, i.e., on an element-by-element and case-by-case basis. Under this setting, the problem of finding the minimum testing strategy such that collected observations will necessarily let us decide whether the IUT is correct or not (i.e., whether it necessarily belongs to the set of possible correct definitions or not) is studied in four possible problem variants: with or without non-determinism; and with or without more than one possible definition in the sets of possible correct and incorrect definitions. The computational complexity of these variants is studied, and properties such as PSPACE-completeness and Log-APX-hardness are identified.</description>

      <title>Hard Clique Formulas for Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to convert any unsatisfiable 3-CNF formula which is sparse and exponentially hard to refute in Resolution into a negative instance of the $k$-clique problem whose corresponding natural encoding as a CNF formula is $n^{\Omega(k)}$-hard to refute in Resolution. This applies to any function $k = k(n)$ of the number $n$ of vertices, provided $k_0 \leq k \leq n^{1/c_0}$, where $k_0$ and $c_0$ are small constants. We establish this by demonstrating that Resolution can simulate the correctness proof of a particular kind of reduction from 3-SAT to the parameterized clique problem. This also re-establishes the known conditional hardness result for $k$-clique which states that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) holds, then the $k$-clique problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$. Since it is known that the analogue of ETH holds for Resolution, unconditionally and with explicit hard instances, this gives a way to obtain explicit instances of $k$-clique that are unconditionally $n^{\Omega(k)}$-hard to refute in Resolution. This answers an open problem that appeared published in the literature at least twice.</description>

      <title>Explicit Almost-Optimal $\varepsilon$-Balanced Codes via Free Expander Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing explicit codes whose rate and distance match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the low-rate, high-distance regime. In 2017, Ta-Shma gave an explicit family of codes where every pair of codewords has relative distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$, with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)})$, matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound up to a factor of $\varepsilon^{o(1)}$. Ta-Shma's construction was based on starting with a good code and amplifying its bias with walks arising from the $s$-wide-replacement product.
  In this work, we give an arguably simpler almost-optimal construction, based on what we call free expander walks: ordinary expander walks where each step is taken on a distinct expander from a carefully chosen sequence. This sequence of expanders is derived from the construction of near-$X$-Ramanujan graphs due to O'Donnell and Wu.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs (qIOPs), a generalization of both quantum Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and quantum Interactive Proofs, as well as a quantum analogue of classical Interactive Oracle Proofs.
  In the model of quantum Interactive Oracle Proofs, we allow multiple rounds of quantum interaction between the quantum prover and the quantum verifier, but the verifier has limited access to quantum resources. This includes both queries to the prover's messages and the complexity of the quantum circuits applied by the verifier. The question of whether QMA admits a quantum interactive oracle proof system is a relaxation of the quantum PCP Conjecture.
  We show the following two main constructions of qIOPs, both of which are unconditional:
  - We construct a qIOP for QMA in which the verifier shares polynomially many EPR pairs with the prover at the start of the protocol and reads only a constant number of qubits from the prover's messages.
  - We provide a stronger construction of qIOP for QMA in which the verifier not only reads a constant number of qubits but also operates on a constant number of qubits overall, including those in their private registers. However, in this stronger setting, the communication complexity becomes exponential. This leaves open the question of whether strong qIOPs for QMA, with polynomial communication complexity, exist.
  As a key component of our construction, we introduce a novel single prover many-qubits test, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Local Search in Rounds on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the query complexity of finding a local minimum in $t$ rounds on general graphs. More precisely, given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and oracle access to an unknown function $f : V \to \mathbb{R}$, the goal is to find a local minimum--a vertex $v$ such that $f(v) \leq f(u)$ for all $(u,v) \in E$--using at most $t$ rounds of interaction with the oracle. The query complexity is well understood on grids, but much less is known beyond. This abstract problem captures many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of a loss function during neural network training.
  For each graph with $n$ vertices, we prove a deterministic upper bound of $O(t n^{1/t} (s\Delta)^{1-1/t})$, where $s$ is the separation number and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We complement this result with a randomized lower bound of $\Omega(t n^{1/t}-t)$ that holds for any connected graph. We also find that parallel steepest descent with a warm start provides improved bounds for graphs with high separation number and bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Nemesis, an Escape Game in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new escape game in graphs that we call Nemesis. The game is played on a graph having a subset of vertices labeled as exits and the goal of one of the two players, called the fugitive, is to reach one of these exit vertices. The second player, i.e. the fugitive adversary, is called the Nemesis. Her goal is to trap the fugitive in a connected component which does not contain any exit. At each round of the game, the fugitive moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. Then the Nemesis deletes one edge anywhere in the graph. The game ends when either the fugitive reached an exit or when he is in a connected component that does not contain any exit. In trees and graphs of maximum degree bounded by 3, Nemesis can be solved in linear time. We also show that a variant of the game called Blizzard where only edges adjacent to the position of the fugitive can be deleted also admits a linear time solution. For arbitrary graphs, we show that Nemesis is PSPACE-complete, and that it is NP-hard on planar multigraphs. We extend our results to the related Cat Herding problem, proving its PSPACE-completeness. We also prove that finding a strategy based on a full binary escape tree whose leaves are exists is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>The computational power of discrete chemical reaction networks with bounded executions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) model systems where molecules interact according to a finite set of reactions such as $A + B \to C$, representing that if a molecule of $A$ and $B$ collide, they disappear and a molecule of $C$ is produced. CRNs can compute Boolean-valued predicates $\phi:\mathbb{N}^d \to \{0,1\}$ and integer-valued functions $f:\mathbb{N}^d \to \mathbb{N}$; for instance $X_1 + X_2 \to Y$ computes the function $\min(x_1,x_2)$.
  We study the computational power of execution bounded CRNs, in which only a finite number of reactions can occur from the initial configuration (e.g., ruling out reversible reactions such as $A \rightleftharpoons B$). The power and composability of such CRNs depend crucially on some other modeling choices that do not affect the computational power of CRNs with unbounded executions, namely whether an initial leader is present, and whether (for predicates) all species are required to "vote" for the Boolean output. If the CRN starts with an initial leader, and can allow only the leader to vote, then all semilinear predicates and functions can be stably computed in $O(n \log n)$ parallel time by execution bounded CRNs.
  However, if no initial leader is allowed, all species vote, and the CRN is "noncollapsing" (does not shrink from initially large to final $O(1)$ size configurations), then execution bounded CRNs are severely limited, able to compute only eventually constant predicates. A key tool is to characterize execution bounded CRNs as precisely those with a nonnegative linear potential function that is strictly decreased by every reaction, a result that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exponential lower bound via exponential sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valiant's famous VP vs. VNP conjecture states that the symbolic permanent polynomial does not have polynomial-size algebraic circuits. However, the best upper bound on the size of the circuits computing the permanent is exponential. Informally, VNP is an exponential sum of VP-circuits. In this paper we study whether, in general, exponential sums (of algebraic circuits) require exponential-size algebraic circuits. We show that the famous Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture indeed implies such an exponential lower bound for an exponential sum. Our main tools come from parameterized complexity. Along the way, we also prove an exponential fpt (fixed-parameter tractable) lower bound for the parameterized algebraic complexity class VW$_{nb}^0$[P], assuming the same conjecture. VW$_{nb}^0$[P] can be thought of as the weighted sums of (unbounded-degree) circuits, where only $\pm 1$ constants are cost-free. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture has been applied to prove explicit exponential lower bounds.
  Furthermore, we prove that when this class is fpt, then a variant of the counting hierarchy, namely the linear counting hierarchy collapses. Moreover, if a certain type of parameterized exponential sums is fpt, then integers, as well as polynomials with coefficients being definable in the linear counting hierarchy have subpolynomial $\tau$-complexity.
  Finally, we characterize a related class VW[F], in terms of permanents, where we consider an exponential sum of algebraic formulas instead of circuits. We show that when we sum over cycle covers that have one long cycle and all other cycles have constant length, then the resulting family of polynomials is complete for VW[F] on certain types of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Control-Theoretic Perspective on Optimal High-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.07168v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a control-theoretic perspective on optimal tensor algorithms for minimizing a convex function in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. Given a function $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is convex and twice continuously differentiable, we study a closed-loop control system that is governed by the operators $\nabla \Phi$ and $\nabla^2 \Phi$ together with a feedback control law $\lambda(\cdot)$ satisfying the algebraic equation $(\lambda(t))^p\|\nabla\Phi(x(t))\|^{p-1} = \theta$ for some $\theta \in (0, 1)$. Our first contribution is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution to this system via the Banach fixed-point theorem. We present a simple yet nontrivial Lyapunov function that allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global solution under certain regularity conditions and analyze the convergence properties of trajectories. The rate of convergence is $O(1/t^{(3p+1)/2})$ in terms of objective function gap and $O(1/t^{3p})$ in terms of squared gradient norm. Our second contribution is to provide two algorithmic frameworks obtained from discretization of our continuous-time system, one of which generalizes the large-step A-HPE framework and the other of which leads to a new optimal $p$-th order tensor algorithm. While our discrete-time analysis can be seen as a simplification and generalization of~\citet{Monteiro-2013-Accelerated}, it is largely motivated by the aforementioned continuous-time analysis, demonstrating the fundamental role that the feedback control plays in optimal acceleration and the clear advantage that the continuous-time perspective brings to algorithmic design. A highlight of our analysis is that we show that all of the $p$-th order optimal tensor algorithms that we discuss minimize the squared gradient norm at a rate of $O(k^{-3p})$, which complements the recent analysis.</description>

      <title>A Complexity Dichotomy for Temporal Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) for every valued structure with the domain ${\mathbb Q}$ that is preserved by all order-preserving bijections. Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};&lt;)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms. This is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Reactive Auction Framework for the Multi-Depot Rural Postman Problem with Dynamic Vehicle Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although unmanned vehicle fleets offer efficiency in transportation, logistics and inspection, their susceptibility to failures poses a significant challenge to mission continuity. We study the Multi-Depot Rural Postman Problem with Rechargeable and Reusable Vehicles (MD-RPP-RRV) with vehicle failures, where unmanned rechargeable vehicles placed at multiple depots with capacity constraints may fail while serving arc-based demands. To address unexpected vehicle breakdowns during operation, we propose a two-stage real-time rescheduling framework. First, a centralized auction quickly generates a feasible rescheduling solution; for this stage, we derive a theoretical additive bound that establishes an analytical guarantee on the worst-case rescheduling penalty. Second, a peer auction refines this baseline through a problem-specific magnetic field router for local schedule repair, utilizing parameters calibrated via sensitivity analysis to ensure controlled computational growth. We benchmark this approach against a simulated annealing metaheuristic to evaluate solution quality and execution speed. Experimental results on 257 diverse failure scenarios demonstrate that the framework achieves an average runtime reduction of over 95\% relative to the metaheuristic baseline, cutting rescheduling times from hours to seconds while maintaining high solution quality. The two-stage framework excels on large-scale instances, surpassing the centralized auction in nearly 80\% of scenarios with an average solution improvement exceeding 12\%. Moreover, it outperforms the simulated annealing mean and best results in 59\% and 28\% of scenarios, respectively, offering the robust speed-quality trade-off required for real-time mission continuity.</description>

      <title>Learning Randomized Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-corrector for a function $f$ takes a black-box oracle computing $f$ that is correct on most inputs and turns it into one that is correct on every input with high probability. Self-correctors exist for any function that is randomly self-reducible (RSR), where the value $f$ at a given point $x$ can be recovered by computing $f$ on random correlated points. While RSRs enable powerful self-correction capabilities and have applications in complexity theory and cryptography, their discovery has traditionally required manual derivation by experts. We present Bitween, a method and tool for automated learning of randomized self-reductions for mathematical functions. We make two key contributions: First, we demonstrate that our learning framework based on linear regression outperforms sophisticated methods including genetic algorithms, symbolic regression, and mixed-integer linear programming for discovering RSRs from correlated samples. Second, we introduce Agentic Bitween, a neuro-symbolic approach where large language models dynamically discover novel query functions for RSR property discovery, leveraging vanilla Bitween as a tool for inference and verification, moving beyond the fixed query functions ($x+r$, $x-r$, $x \cdot r$, $x$, $r$) previously used in the literature. On RSR-Bench, our benchmark suite of 80 scientific and machine learning functions, vanilla Bitween surpasses existing symbolic methods, while Agentic Bitween discovers new RSR properties using frontier models to uncover query functions.</description>

      <title>Freeze-Tag is NP-hard in 2D with $L_1$ distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) is a scheduling problem with application in robot swarm activation and was introduced by Arkin et al. in 2002. This problem seeks an efficient way of activating a robot swarm, starting with a single active robot. Activations occur through direct contact, and once a robot becomes active, it can move and help activate other robots. Although the problem has been shown to be NP-hard in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the $L_2$ distance, and in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ under any $L_p$ distance with $p \ge 1$, its complexity under the $L_1$ (Manhattan) distance in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has remained an open question. In this paper, we settle this question by proving that FTP is strongly NP-hard in the Euclidean plane with $L_1$ distance.</description>

Abstract: We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.
  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for QAC0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14643</link>

Abstract: In this work, we prove the strongest known lower bounds for QAC$^0$, allowing polynomially many gates and ancillae. Our main results show that:
  (1) Depth-3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY, and require $\Omega(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ gates to compute MAJORITY.
  (2) Depth-2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage, regardless of size.
  We develop new classical simulation techniques for QAC$^0$ to obtain our depth-3 bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit, making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ (exp size). Our techniques further suggest that, for boolean total functions, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound). Finally, we argue that approximating PARITY in QAC0, with significantly better than 1/poly(n) advantage on average, is just as hard as computing it exactly. Thus, extending our techniques to higher depths would also rule out approximate circuits for PARITY and related problems</description>
