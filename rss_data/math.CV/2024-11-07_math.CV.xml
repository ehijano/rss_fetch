      <title>The Bohr's Phenomenon for the class of K-quasiconformal harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish several sharp versions of improved Bohr inequality, refined Bohr-type inequality, and refined Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for the class of $K$-quasiconformal sense-preserving harmonic mappings $f=h+\overline{g}$ in the unit disk $\mathbb{D} := \{z\in\mathbb{C} : |z| &lt; 1\}$. In order to achieve these objectives, we employ the non-negative quantity $S_\rho(h)$ and the concept of replacing the initial coefficients of the majorant series by the absolute values of the analytic function and its derivative, as well as other various settings. Moreover, we obtain the sharp Bohr-Rogosinski radius for harmonic mappings in the unit disk by replacing the bounding condition on the analytic function $h$ with the half-plane condition.</description>

      <title>Exponential actions defined by vector configurations, Gale duality, and moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential actions defined by vector configurations provide a universal framework for several constructions of holomorphic dynamics, non-Kaehler complex geometry, toric geometry and topology. These include leaf spaces of holomorphic foliations, intersections of real and Hermitian quadrics, the quotient construction of toric varieties, LVM and LVMB manifolds, complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and their partial quotients. In all of these cases, the geometry and topology of the appropriate quotient object can be described by combinatorial data including a pair of Gale dual vector configurations.</description>

      <title>On lower distance estimates of mappings in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mappings satisfying an upper bound for the distortion of families of curves. We establish lower bounds for the distortion of distances under such mappings. As applications, we obtain theorems on the discreteness of the limit mapping of a sequence of mappings converging locally uniformly. We separately consider cases when mappings are defined in Euclidean $n$-dimensional space and in a metric space.</description>

      <title>The Bohr radius for operator valued functions on simply connected domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish an improved Bohr inequality for the class of operator-valued holomorphic functions $f$ on a simply connected domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Next, we establish a generalization of refined version of the Bohr inequality and the Bohr-Rogosinski inequality with the help of the sequence $\varphi=\{\varphi_n(r) \}^{\infty}_{n=0}$ of non-negative continuous functions in $[0,1)$ such that the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\varphi_n(r)$ converges locally uniformly on the interval $[0,1)$. All the results are proved to be sharp. Moreover, We establish the Bohr inequality and the Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for the class of operator-valued $\nu$-Bloch functions defined in two different simply connected domains, $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{\gamma}$, in $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>The Bohr's phenomenon for K-quasiconformal harmonic mappings associates with subordination classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish several sharp versions of improved Bohr inequality, refined Bohr inequality, and Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for the class of $K$-quasiconformal sense-preserving harmonic mappings $f=h+\overline{g}$ in the unit disk $\Bbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|&lt;1\}$. In this setting, the analytic component is subordinate to an analytic function $\phi$ in $\Bbb{D}$, where $\phi$ is either a convex or a general univalent function. To do these, we employ the non-negative quantity $S_r(h)$ and the concept of replacing the initial coefficients with the absolute values of the analytic function and its derivative in the majorant series. Furthermore, we obtain the sharp Bohr radius and Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for sense-preserving $K$-quasiconformal harmonic mappings in which the analytic part is subordinate to a function belonging to the family of concave univalent functions with opening angle $\pi \alpha$ at infinity, where $\alpha\in[1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of layer potentials and Riemann-Hilbert problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of layer potential operators for the harmonic transmission problem over a sequence of converging two-sided extension domains. Consequently, the Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, Calder{\'o}n projectors, and associated Neumann series converge in this setting. As a result, we generalize the notion of Cauchy integrals and, in a sense, of Hilbert transforms for a class of extension domains. Our approach relies on dyadic approximations of arbitrary open sets, considering convergence in terms of characteristic functions, Hausdorff distance, and compact sets.</description>

      <title>A general quantified Ingham-Karamata Tauberian theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general quantified Ingham-Karamata Tauberian theorem with a flexible one-sided Tauberian condition under several types of boundary behavior for the Laplace transform. Our results in particular improve a theorem by Stahn, removing a vexing restriction on the growth of the Laplace transform. Improving existing optimality results, we also show that the obtained quantified rate is optimal in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum-Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, with isolated singularities, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X,\mathscr{F}, D)$, where $ \mathscr{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D $ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Lipman--Zariski conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the lower bounds of $p$-modulus of families of paths and a finite connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of the lower bounds of the modulus of families of paths of order $p,$ $p&gt;n-1,$ and their connection with the geometry of domains containing the specified families. Among other things, we have proved an analogue of N\"akki's theorem on the positivity of the $p$-module of families of paths joining a pair of continua in the given domain. The geometry of domains with a strongly accessible boundary in the sense of the $p$-modulus of families of paths was also studied. We show that domains with a $p$-strongly accessible boundary with respect to a $p$-modulus, $p&gt;n-1,$ are are finitely connected at their boundary. The mentioned result generalizes N\"akki's result, which was proved for uniform domains in the case of a conformal modulus.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the Carath\'eodory and Szeg\"o metrics on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study several intrinsic properties of the Carath\'eodory and Szeg\"o metrics on finitely connected planar domains. Among them are the existence of closed geodesics and geodesic spirals, boundary behaviour of Gaussian curvatures, and $L^2$-cohomology. A formula for the Szeg\"o metric in terms of the Weierstrass $\wp$-function is obtained. Variations of these metrics and their Gaussian curvatures on planar annuli are also studied. Consequently, we obtain optimal universal upper bounds for their Gaussian curvatures and show that no universal lower bounds exist for their Gaussian curvatures. Moreover, it follows that there are domains where the Gaussian curvature of the Szeg\"o metric assumes both negative and positive values. Lastly, it is also observed that there is no universal upper bound for the ratio of the Szeg\"o and Carath\'eodory metrics.</description>
