      <title>Quantization for OpenAI's Whisper Models: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for applications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription. This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

      <title>Efficient Adapter Tuning for Joint Singing Voice Beat and Downbeat Tracking with Self-supervised Learning Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice beat tracking is a challenging task, due to the lack of musical accompaniment that often contains robust rhythmic and harmonic patterns, something most existing beat tracking systems utilize and can be essential for estimating beats. In this paper, a novel temporal convolutional network-based beat-tracking approach featuring self-supervised learning (SSL) representations and adapter tuning is proposed to track the beat and downbeat of singing voices jointly. The SSL DistilHuBERT representations are utilized to capture the semantic information of singing voices and are further fused with the generic spectral features to facilitate beat estimation. Sources of variabilities that are particularly prominent with the non-homogeneous singing voice data are reduced by the efficient adapter tuning. Extensive experiments show that feature fusion and adapter tuning improve the performance individually, and the combination of both leads to significantly better performances than the un-adapted baseline system, with up to 31.6% and 42.4% absolute F1-score improvements on beat and downbeat tracking, respectively.</description>

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-model task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, a method called MACS is proposed to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Whisper Speaker Identification: Leveraging Pre-Trained Multilingual Transformers for Robust Speaker Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker identification in multilingual settings presents unique challenges, particularly when conventional models are predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose WSI (Whisper Speaker Identification), a framework that repurposes the encoder of the Whisper automatic speech recognition model pre trained on extensive multilingual data to generate robust speaker embeddings via a joint loss optimization strategy that leverages online hard triplet mining and self supervised Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy loss. By capitalizing on Whisper language-agnostic acoustic representations, our approach effectively distinguishes speakers across diverse languages and recording conditions. Extensive evaluations on multiple corpora, including VoxTube (multilingual), JVS (Japanese), CallHome (German, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), and Voxconverse (English), demonstrate that WSI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, namely Pyannote Embedding, ECAPA TDNN, and Xvector, in terms of lower equal error rates and higher AUC scores. These results validate our hypothesis that a multilingual pre-trained ASR encoder, combined with joint loss optimization, substantially improves speaker identification performance in non-English languages.</description>

      <title>ValSub: Subsampling Validation Data to Mitigate Forgetting during ASR Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is widely used within consumer devices such as mobile phones. Recently, personalization or on-device model fine-tuning has shown that adaptation of ASR models towards target user speech improves their performance over rare words or accented speech. Despite these gains, fine-tuning on user data (target domain) risks the personalized model to forget knowledge about its original training distribution (source domain) i.e. catastrophic forgetting, leading to subpar general ASR performance. A simple and efficient approach to combat catastrophic forgetting is to measure forgetting via a validation set that represents the source domain distribution. However, such validation sets are large and impractical for mobile devices. Towards this, we propose a novel method to subsample a substantially large validation set into a smaller one while maintaining the ability to estimate forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of such a dataset in mitigating forgetting by utilizing it to dynamically determine the number of ideal fine-tuning epochs. When measuring the deviations in per user fine-tuning epochs against a 50x larger validation set (oracle), our method achieves a lower mean-absolute-error (3.39) compared to randomly selected subsets of the same size (3.78-8.65). Unlike random baselines, our method consistently tracks the oracle's behaviour across three different forgetting thresholds.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment for LLM-based Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs across various tasks, laying the foundation for the development of LLM-based speech translation systems. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of inner-layer speech-text alignment in LLMs and provide new insights into enhancing cross-modal learning.</description>

      <title>Handling Domain Shifts for Anomalous Sound Detection: A Review of DCASE-Related Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When detecting anomalous sounds in complex environments, one of the main difficulties is that trained models must be sensitive to subtle differences in monitored target signals, while many practical applications also require them to be insensitive to changes in acoustic domains. Examples of such domain shifts include changing the type of microphone or the location of acoustic sensors, which can have a much stronger impact on the acoustic signal than subtle anomalies themselves. Moreover, users typically aim to train a model only on source domain data, which they may have a relatively large collection of, and they hope that such a trained model will be able to generalize well to an unseen target domain by providing only a minimal number of samples to characterize the acoustic signals in that domain. In this work, we review and discuss recent publications focusing on this domain generalization problem for anomalous sound detection in the context of the DCASE challenges on acoustic machine condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>AudioX: Diffusion Transformer for Anything-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/</description>

      <title>NotaGen: Advancing Musicality in Symbolic Music Generation with Large Language Model Training Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18008v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion-Based Generative Equalizer for Music Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to audio restoration, focusing on the enhancement of low-quality music recordings, and in particular historical ones. Building upon a previous algorithm called BABE, or Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension, we introduce BABE-2, which presents a series of improvements. This research broadens the concept of bandwidth extension to \emph{generative equalization}, a novel task that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. BABE-2 is built around an optimization algorithm utilizing priors from diffusion models, which are trained or fine-tuned using a curated set of high-quality music tracks. The algorithm simultaneously performs two critical tasks: estimation of the filter degradation magnitude response and hallucination of the restored audio. The proposed method is objectively evaluated on historical piano recordings, showing an enhancement over the prior version. The method yields similarly impressive results in rejuvenating the works of renowned vocalists Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba. This research represents an advancement in the practical restoration of historical music.</description>

      <title>MambaFoley: Foley Sound Generation using Selective State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to widespread use of techniques for audio content generation, notably employing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) across various tasks. Among these, Foley Sound Synthesis is of particular interest for its role in applications for the creation of multimedia content. Given the temporal-dependent nature of sound, it is crucial to design generative models that can effectively handle the sequential modeling of audio samples. Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been proposed as a valid alternative to previously proposed techniques, demonstrating competitive performance with lower computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce MambaFoley, a diffusion-based model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage the recently proposed SSM known as Mamba for the Foley sound generation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with a state-of-the-art Foley sound generative model using both objective and subjective analyses.</description>

      <title>Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06846v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>
