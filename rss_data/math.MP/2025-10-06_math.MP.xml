      <title>Some notes on the Hellinger distance and various Fisher-Rao distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These expository notes introduce the Hellinger distance on the set of all measures and the induced Fisher-Rao distances for subsets of measures, such as probability measures or Gaussian measures. The historical background is highlighted and the relations and the distinct features of the two distances are discussed. Moreover, we provide a dynamic characterization of absolutely continuous curves in the Hellinger spaces in terms of the growth equation, which replaces the continuity equation in the theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave Solutions in 1D and 2D for the Broer-Kaup-Boussinesq-Kupershmidt (BKBK) System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BKBK system is a singular perturbation of the classical shallow water equations which modifies their transport velocity to depend on wave elevation slope. This modification introduces backward diffusion terms proportional to a real parameter $\kappa$. These terms also make BKBK completely integrable as a Hamiltonian system. Remarkably, when $\kappa=i/2$ the BKBK system may be transformed into the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS). Thus, the BKBK system with its real parameter $\kappa$ is complementary to the traditional modulational approach for water waves. We investigate the Lie algebraic and variational properties of the BKBK system in this paper and we study its solution behaviour in certain computational simulations of regularised versions of the 1D and 2D BKBK systems.</description>

      <title>Ohta-Kawasaki Model Reveals Patterns on Multicomponent Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new mechanochemical modeling framework to explore the shape deformation and pattern formation in multicomponent vesicle membranes. In this framework, the shape of the membrane is described by an elastic bending model, while phase separation of membrane-bound activator proteins is determined by an Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) model. The coupled dynamics consist of an overdamped force-balanced equation for the membrane geometry and an OK-type advection-reaction-diffusion equation on the deformable membrane. We implement efficient spectral methods to simulate these dynamics in both two- and three-dimensions. Numerical experiments show that the model successfully reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed membrane morphologies \cite{baumgart2003imaging}. Taken together, the framework unifies curvature mechanics, microphase separation, and active forcing, providing new insight into membrane-bounded multicomponent vesicle dynamics and a practical platform for studying multicomponent biomembrane morphology.</description>

      <title>Fermionic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Wasserstein distances are obtained between dynamical systems (with states as special case), on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded von Neumann algebras. This is achieved through a systematic translation from non-graded to $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded transport plans, on usual and fermionic (or $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded) tensor products respectively. The metric properties of these fermionic Wasserstein distances are shown, and their symmetries relevant to deviation of a system from quantum detailed balance are investigated. The latter is done in conjunction with the development of a complete mathematical framework for detailed balance in systems involving indistinguishable fermions.</description>

      <title>Rotating Isospectral Drums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis I demonstrate that isospectral domains, that is domains of differing geometric shapes that possess identical spectra, do not remain isospectral when subject to uniform rotation. One thus *can* hear the shape of a rotating drum. It is shown that the spectra diverge as $\propto\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2$ similarly to a square but different from a circle, whose degenerate eigenfrequencies split $\propto \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)$. The latter two cases are studied analytically and used as test cases for the selection of numerical solution methods. I demonstrate that the presence of a simple medium attenuates the effects of rotation on the spectrum differences. Further I show that the common but linearised augmented wave equation yields eigenmodes with sensible structure for non-physical parameters, whereas a full equation destroys the structure as intended. The full equation is obtained from first principles using Maxwell equations formulated as differential forms and a careful application of the 3+1 foliation of space-time. The differences of the result from literature arXiv:physics/0607016 are highlighted and their effects studied. The equation is treated analytically on simple domains to obtain reference data for numerical analysis. Nodal and modal discretisations of the PDE are tested and a self-written FEM implementation is chosen due to higher precision of the results. As part of the validation process I demonstrate that results of arXiv:physics/0607016 are reproducible. The resulting gyroscopic quadratic eigenvalue problem is linearised into a Hamiltonian/skew-Hamiltonian pencil and a suitable shift operator for the Arnoldi iteration is determined. The resulting formulation is solved using ARPACK.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional long-range Ising model: two (almost) equivalent approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions using the functional renormalization group in the local potential approximation (LPA), and compare our findings with Dyson's hierarchical model (DHM). While the DHM lacks translational invariance, it admits a field-theoretical description closely resembling the LPA, up to minor but nontrivial differences. After reviewing the real-space renormalization group approach to the DHM, we demonstrate a remarkable agreement in the critical exponent $\nu$ between the two methods across the entire range of power-law decays $1/2 &lt; \sigma &lt; 1$. We further benchmark our results against Monte Carlo simulations and analytical expansions near the upper boundary of the nontrivial regime, $\sigma \lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Introduction To Signature Change Through a Natural Extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry "up in the bundle". This reveals a "signature change without signature change" scenario - a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler - and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein framework in a conceptually natural direction.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Time-Dependent Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of time-dependent (TD) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H(t)$ that can be transformed into a time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH}$ using a suitable TD unitary transformation $F(t)$. The latter can in turn be related to a Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ by a similarity transformation, $h=\rho \mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho$ is the Dyson map. Accordingly, once the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ is solved, the general solution of the initial system can be deduced. This allows to define the appropriate $\tilde{\eta}(t)$-inner product for the Hilbert space associated with $H(t)$, where $\tilde{\eta}(t)=F^{\dagger}(t)\eta F(t)$ and $\eta=\rho^{\dagger}\rho$ is the metric operator. This greatly simplifies the computation of the relevant uncertainty relations for these systems. As an example, we consider a model of a particle with a TD mass subjected to a specific TD complex linear potential. We thus obtain two Hermitian Hamiltonians, namely that of the standard harmonic oscillator and that of the inverted oscillator. For both cases, the auxiliary equation admits a solution, and the exact analytical solutions are squeezed states given in terms of the Hermite polynomials with complex coefficients. Moreover, when the Hermitian Hamiltonian is that of the harmonic oscillator, the position-momentum uncertainty relation is real and greater than or equal to $\hbar/2$, thereby confirming its consistency.</description>

      <title>Slant sums of quiver gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of slant sum of quiver gauge theories, a type of surgery on the underlying quiver. Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed points on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver varieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions before and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule" for vertex functions.
  Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the factorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The branching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special cases, it also provides a formula for the $\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex functions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over reverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture, such expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma modules on the 3d mirror dual side.
  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what can be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums of Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional framing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking products.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lubrication theory leverages the assumption of a long and thin fluid domain to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Models in extended lubrication theory consider relaxations of the thin film assumption, leading to the inclusion of higher order terms. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our models with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. Nonetheless, the magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Fast surrogate modelling of EIT in atomic quantum systems using LSTM neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting, parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and feedback-based optimisation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Radius of Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a square matrix, the range of its Rayleigh quotients is known as the numerical range, which is a compact and convex set by the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem. The largest value and the smallest boundary value (in magnitude) of this convex set are known as the numerical radius and inner numerical radius respectively. The numerical radius is often used to study the convergence rate of iterative methods for solving linear systems. In this work, we investigate these radii for complex non-Hermitian random matrix and its elliptic variants. For the former, remarkably, these radii can be represented as extrema of a stationary Airy-like process, which undergoes a correlation-decorrelation transition from small to large time scale. Based on this transition, we obtain the precise first and second order terms of the numerical radii. In the elliptic case, we prove that the fluctuation of the numerical radii boils down to the maximum or minimum of two independent Tracy-Widom variables.</description>

      <title>A review on the Parameter Space Concept and its use for crystal structure determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the emerging crystal structure determination method Parameter Space Concept (PSC), which solves and refines either partial or complete crystal structures by mapping each experimental or theoretical observation as a geometric interpretation, bypassing the conventional Fourier inversion. The PSC utilizes only a few \xray (equivalently neutron) diffraction amplitudes or intensities and turns them into piecewise analytic hyper-surfaces, called isosurfaces, embedded in a higher-dimensional orthonormal Cartesian space (Parameter Space (PS)). It reformulates the crystal determination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common intersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds of isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized ratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods in PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The elegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates, enabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by combining multiple projections. By these means, the user may explore homometric and non-homometric solutions within both centric and acentric structures with spatial resolution remarkably down to pm, even with a limited number of diffraction reflections. Having demonstrated the potential of PSC for various synthetic structures and exemplarily verified direct application to realistic crystals, the origin and development of PSC methods are coherently discussed in this review. Notably, this review emphasizes the theoretical foundations, computational strategies, and potential extensions of PSC, outlining the roadmap for future applications of PSC in the broader context of structure determination from experimental diffraction observations.</description>

      <title>Universal classical-quantum channel resolvability and private channel coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks.
  Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic processes with absorbing states, the quasi-stationary distribution provides valuable insights into the long-term behaviour prior to absorption. In this work, we revisit two well-established numerical methods for its computation. The first is an iterative algorithm for solving the non-linear equation that defines the quasi-stationary distribution. We generalise this technique to accommodate general Markov stochastic processes, either with discrete or continuous state space, and with multiple absorbing states. The second is a Monte Carlo method with resetting, for which we propose a novel single-trajectory approach that uses the trajectory's own history to perform resets after absorption. In addition to these methodological contributions, we provide a detailed analysis of implementation aspects for both methods. We also compare their accuracy and efficiency across a range of examples. The results indicate that the iterative algorithm is generally the preferred choice for problems with simple boundaries, while the Monte Carlo approach is more suitable for problems with complex boundaries, where the implementation of the iterative algorithm is a challenging task.</description>

      <title>A numerical stabilization scheme for the shallow shelf approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Thickness Stabilization Scheme (TSS), a numerical stabilization scheme suitable for the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA), one of the most widely-used models for large-scale Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet simulations. The TSS is constructed by inserting an adapted, explicit Euler thickness evolution equation into the driving stress term, thereby treating the term implicitly. We investigate the applicability of TSS across low- and high-shear idealized scenarios, by altering the inflow velocity and initial ice thickness. TSS demonstrates an increase in the numerical stability of SSA, allowing large time-step sizes of dt = 50-100 years to remain numerically stable and accurate, while time-step sizes of dt &gt; 5 in high-shear simulations show significant error without TSS. Remarkably, a time step size as large as dt = 10 000 years is numerically stable with TSS, albeit with a reduction in accuracy. TSS offers greater flexibility for ice-sheet modeling by allowing the re-allocation of computational resources. This method is applicable not only to ice-sheet modeling, including in coupled frameworks, but also to other vertically-integrated computational fluid dynamics problems that couple momentum and geometry evolution equations.</description>

      <title>New perspectives in Kac-Moody algebras associated to higher dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we present the construction of generalized current algebras $\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.</description>

      <title>Percolation and criticality of systems with competing interactions on Bethe lattices: limitations and potential strengths of cluster schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random clusters introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (FK) and analyzed by Coniglio and Klein (CK) for Ising and related models have led first Swendsen and Wang and then Wolff to formulate remarkably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes that weaken the critical slowing down. In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</description>

      <title>Duality Structures in Unimodular Electrovacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such that unimodular (trace-free) gravity in electrovacuum can be consistently represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of 2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between Hodge dual and an operator constructed from the Maxwell tensor; symbolically, $[\text{Riem}, \star] = [\star, F \boxtimes F]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved in the spherically symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated field equations.</description>

      <title>Modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for CSS codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum information for these models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and invariance algebras of the $d$-dimensional Dunkl-Coulomb problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the rich algebraic structure of the standard $d$-dimensional Coulomb problem can be extended to its Dunkl counterpart. Replacing standard derivatives by Dunkl ones in the so($d+1$,2) dynamical algebra generators of the former gives rise to a deformed algebra with similar commutation relations, except that the metric tensor becomes dependent on the reflection operators and that there are some additional commutation or anticommutation relations involving the latter. It is then shown that from some of the dynamical algebra generators it is straightforward to derive the integrals of motion of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Sturm representation. Finally, from the latter, the components of a deformed Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector are built. Together with the Dunkl angular momentum components, such operators insure the superintegrability of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Schr\"odinger representation.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed, leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of solvable multi-matrix models associated with an arbitrary embedded graph $\Gamma$ with a single vertex. The graph with $n$ edges is equipped with $2n$ corner matrices. The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$. We also consider mixed ensembles of matrices from $GL(N),U(N)$ and $SU(N)$.</description>

      <title>Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for Schrodinger operator: the Method of Microlocal Wronskian and Gram Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new formulation of the well known Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS) of order 2 for a Schrodinger operator within the algebraic and microlocal framework of B. Helffer and J. Sjostrand; BS holds precisely when the Gram matrix consisting of scalar products of some WKB solutions with respect to the "flux norm" is not invertible. This condition is obtained using the microlocal Wronskian and does not rely on traditional matching techniques. It is simplified by using action-angle variables. The interest of this procedure lies in its possible generalization to matrixvalued Hamiltonians, like Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information, defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</description>

Abstract: We present an elementary proof establishing the equality of the right and left-sided $\sqrt{\kappa}$-quantum lengths for an SLE$_\kappa$ curve, where $\kappa\in (0,4]$. We achieve this by demonstrating that the$\sqrt{\kappa}$-quantum length is equal to the $(\sqrt{\kappa}/2)$-Gaussian multiplicative chaos with reference measure given by half the conformal Minkowski content of the curve, multiplied by $2/(4-\kappa)$ for $\kappa\in (0,4)$ and by $1$ for $\kappa=4$. Our proof relies on a novel "one-sided" approximation of the conformal Minkowski content, which is compatible with the conformal change of coordinates formula.</description>

Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner and can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations.</description>

      <title>2D Entanglement from a Twisted Motzkin Spaghetto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar 2D entanglement properties can be realized by twisting a single 1D chain embedded on a 2D lattice. The interaction to generate such 2D entanglement is much simpler than the previous 2D construction by coupling orthogonal arrays of 1D highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous bona fide 2D models, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. The tensor network representation of the new ground state is composed of tensors with lower rank, showing a similar global geometry as those of the old ones.</description>

      <title>Moment-enhanced shallow water equations for non-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shallow water equations often assume a constant velocity profile along the vertical axis. However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature.</description>

      <title>A covariant approach to the Dirac field in LRS space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the polar decomposition to describe the Dirac field in terms of an effective spinorial fluid. After reformulating all covariant equations in ``spinorial'' signature $(+ -- )$, we develop a $(1+1+2)$ covariant approach for the Dirac field that does not require the use of tetrad fields or Clifford matrices. By identifying the velocity and spin fields as the generators of time-like and space-like congruences, we examine the compatibility of a self-gravitating Dirac field with Locally Rotationally Symmetric space-times of types I, II, and III. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our construction.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>
