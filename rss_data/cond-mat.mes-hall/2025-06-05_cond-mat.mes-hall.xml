      <title>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and modulable induced superconducting gap and effective Land\'e g-factor in Pb-InSb hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Land\'e g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Critical transport behavior in quantum dot solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to recent advances, silicon solar cells are rapidly approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% efficiency. Quantum Dot (QD) solar cells have the potential to surpass this limit and enable a new generation of photovoltaic technologies beyond the capabilities of any existing solar energy modalities. The creation of the first epitaxially-fused quantum dot solids showing broad phase coherence and metallicity necessary for solar implementation has not yet been achieved, and the metal-insulator transition in these materials needs to be explored. We have created a new model of electron transport through QD solids, informed by 3D-tomography of QD solid samples, which considers disorder in both the on-site and hopping terms of the commonly studied Anderson Hamiltonian. We used the transfer matrix method and finite-size scaling to create a dynamic metal-insulator transition phase diagram. For a surprisingly large portion of the parameter space, our model shows a critical exponent distinct from the expected value for the Anderson transition. We show the existence of a crossover region from the universality class of the Anderson transition (AI) to the Chiral Orthogonal class (BDI) due to the addition of weak kinetic (hopping) disorder.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Compact Modeling for the Drain Current Variability in Single-Layer Graphene FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the growth of emerging graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) technologies, a thorough characterization of on-wafer variability is required. Here, we report for the first time a physics-based compact model, which precisely describes the drain current (ID) fluctuations of monolayer GFETs. Physical mechanisms known to generate 1/f noise in transistors, such as carrier number and Coulomb scattering mobility fluctuations, are also revealed to cause ID variance. Such effects are considered in the model by being activated locally in the channel and the integration of their contributions from source to drain results in total variance. The proposed model is experimentally validated from a statistical population of three different-sized solution-gated (SG) GFETs from strong p- to strong n-type bias conditions. A series resistance ID variance model is also derived mainly contributing at high carrier densities.</description>

      <title>Scanning gate microscopy probing of anisotropic electron flow in a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the anisotropic dispersion features of a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) oriented $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interfaces, as revealed by scanning gate microscopy of electronic flow from a quantum point contact. The dispersion relation of the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface is characterized by a highly non-circular Fermi surface. Here, we develop an efficient tight-binding model for the electron gas at the interface. We show that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface causes both the direction of the electron flux from the quantum point contact and the periodicity of the self-interference conductance fringes to depend strongly on the orientation of the constriction relative to the crystal lattice. We show that the radially non-uniform distribution of the Fermi velocity on the Fermi surface results in skewing of electron trajectories when the quantum point contact gates are not aligned with the in-plane primitive vectors. We show that this effect results in the separation of electrons belonging to different orbitals for wide (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ quantum wells.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Hall Spectroscopy of Elliptically Deformed Graphene Nanobubble Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in strain-engineering technology of graphene and 2D materials, graphene quantum dots (QDs) defined by the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields (PMFs) have been of interest, with the feasibility of tunable graphene qubits. Here, we theoretically investigate how the electronic states of the nanobubble QDs are influenced by the geometrical anisotropy of the elliptical-shape nanobubbles. We examine the energy levels of the single QD (SQD) and double QD (DQD) spectra by varying the elliptical deformation in the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. We found that the SQD and DQD show distinguished behavior with respect to the direction of the elliptical deformation. While the SQD levels are substantially affected by the $y$-directional deformation, the DQD levels are largely shifted by the $x$-directional deformation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-photoelectric effect in graphene via tailored potential landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of charge carriers in planar graphene under the combined influence of a constant transversal magnetic field $B$ and an in-plane varying electric potential $\phi(x)$. By suitably designing the potential landscape $\phi(x)$, we may effectively steer charge carriers generated by photo-excitation, for example, in order to achieve an efficient charge separation. These finding may pave the way for transport schemes or photoelectric/photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for energy-efficient hardware for artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres requires integrated photonic solutions delivering optical transceivers with Tbit/s data rates and energy consumption$&lt;$1pJ/bit. Here, we report double single-layer graphene electro-absorption modulators on Si optimized for energy-efficient and ultra-fast operation, demonstrating 67GHz bandwidth and 80Gbit/s data rate, in both O and C bands, using a fabrication tailored for wafer-scale integration. We measure a data rate$\sim$1.6 times larger than previously reported for graphene. We scale the modulator's active area down to 22$\mu$m$^2$, achieving a dynamic power consumption$\sim$58fJ/bit, $\sim$3 times lower than previous graphene modulators and Mach-Zehnder modulators based on Si or lithium niobate. We show devices with$\sim$0.037dB/V$\mu$m modulation efficiency,$\sim$16 times better than previous demonstrations based on graphene. This paves the way to wafer-scale production of graphene modulators on Si useful for Tbit/s optical transceivers and energy-efficient AI</description>

      <title>Ultralong Room-Temperature Qubit Lifetimes of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular electron spin qubits offer atomic-level tunability and room-temperature quantum coherence. Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance towards ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices of stable organic radical qubits allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve ultralong spin relaxation time (T1 &gt; 300 {\mu}s) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins including 1H, 11B, and 13C. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.</description>

      <title>An 11-qubit atom processor in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus atoms in silicon are an outstanding platform for quantum computing as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence time over seconds. By placing multiple phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometers, they couple via the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables multi-qubit control above the fault-tolerant threshold and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms. To achieve quantum error correction, fast and efficient interconnects have to be implemented between spin registers while maintaining high fidelity across all qubit metrics. Here, we demonstrate such integration with a fully controlled 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers which are linked via electron exchange interaction. Through the development of scalable calibration and control protocols, we achieve coherent coupling between nuclear spins using a combination of single- and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.5% to 99.99%. We verify the efficient all-to-all connectivity by preparing both local and non-local Bell states with a record state fidelity beyond 99% and extend entanglement through the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states over all data qubits. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear-spin registers, we realise a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.</description>

      <title>Magic of nonlocal geometric force: lighting up optical transition and transporting angular momentum by chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the nonlocal geometric force -- arising from the molecular Berry curvature -- on the lattice dynamics of magnetic materials with broken time-reversal symmetry. A first-principles computational framework is established to evaluate this force across the entire Brillouin zone. We apply it to monolayer CoCl$_2$, a ferromagnetic half-semiconductor with a narrow bandgap forbidding direct dipolar optical transition. At the phonon Brillouin zone center, the pronounced nonlocal geometric force leads to a splitting of the two upper optical phonon branches by $3 \times 10^{-2}$ THz, transforming the phonons into chiral modes. Optical chiral phonons can light up the intravalley dark exciton via absorpting circularly polarized photons. Furthermore, acoustic chiral phonons induced by the nonlocal geometric force can transport angular momentum and contribute to a non-dissipative phonon Hall viscosity.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the resonant spin response of a stirred polariton condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the enhancement of the spin coherence time (T2) by almost an order-of-magnitude in exciton-polariton condensates through driven spin precession resonance. Using a rotating optical trap formed by a bichromatic laser excitation, we synchronize the trap stirring frequency with the condensate intrinsic Larmor precession, achieving an order of magnitude increase in spin coherence. By tuning the optical trap profile via excitation lasers intensity, we precisely control the resonance width. Here we present a theoretical model that explains our experimental findings in terms of the mutual synchronization of the condensate circular polarization components. Our findings underpin the potential of polariton condensates for spinoptronic devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Flat-band compactons in a two-dimensional driven-dissipative Lieb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the effect of inter-particle interactions on the flat-band states of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice with drive and dissipation. Exploiting the giant nonlinear interactions of exciton polaritons we observe compactly localised solitons (compactons) embedded within the continuum of propagating state bands -- a form of nonlinear bound state in the continuum (BIC). The driven-dissipative nature of the system leads to a sudden self-localisation into the compacton state above a threshold power. The experimental results agree well with numerical simulations. These results have implications for the physics of interacting quantum particles in flat-band systems and for generation of quantum-correlated light and spatially multiplexed coherent information transport.</description>

      <title>Topological Jackiw-Rebbi States in Photonic Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phenomena, first studied in solid state physics, have seen increased interest for applications in nanophotonics owing to highly controllable light confinement with inherent robustness to defects. Photonic crystals can be designed to host topologically protected interface states for directional light transport, localization and robust lasing via tuning of the bulk topological invariant. At the same time, van der Waals (vdW) materials, in both their monolayer and quasi-bulk forms, are emerging as exciting additions to the field of nanophotonics, with a range of unique optoelectronic properties and intrinsic adherence to any type of host material, allowing fabrication of complex multi-layer structures. We present here a 1D topological photonic platform made from stacked nanostructured and planar layers of quasi-bulk WS$_2$ to achieve Jackiw-Rebbi (JR) interface states between two topologically distinct gratings in the near-infrared range around 750 nm. Such states are measured in the far-field with angle-resolved reflectance contrast measurements, exhibiting linewidth of 10 meV and highly directional emission with an angular bandwidth of 8.0$^\circ$. Subsequent local mapping of the structure via sub-wavelength resolution scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) reveals strong spatial confinement of the JR state to the grating interface region. Finally, we couple in the JR state the photoluminescence of monolayer WSe$_2$ incorporated in a five-layer vdW grating heterostructure, giving rise to directional enhancement of the excitonic emission of up to 22 times that of uncoupled monolayer, thus demonstrating the potential of the topological interface states for highly directional light emission in addition to light scattering.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of Topological Index driven by Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological insulators under dephasing noise. With examples of both a $2d$ Chern insulator and a $3d$ topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that there is a phase transition at finite dephasing strength between phases with nontrivial and trivial topological indices. Here the topological index is defined through the correlation matrix. The transition can be diagnosed through the spectrum of the whole correlation matrix or of a local subsystem. Interestingly, even if the topological insulator is very close to the topological-trivial critical point in its Hamiltonian, it still takes finite strength of dephasing to change the topological index, suggesting the robustness of topological insulators under dephasing. In the case of Chern insulator, this robustness of the phase with nontrivial Chern number persists near the critical point between the topological and Anderson insulator, which is tuned by the strength of disorder in the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction of a doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme further predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy-Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl$_3$ is manipulated by incorporating four different transition-metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in-plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto-inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl$_3$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac half-metal in which spin-polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the $\Gamma$-point and thus the spin-orbit interaction-driven quantum anomalous Hall phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy-driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red- and blue-shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal-field effects, transforms Dirac half-metal to a Dirac spin-gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy-engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantum device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for industrial applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that, due to their symmetry which depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe bilayers (Te-Mn-Te-Mn-Te) as candidate devices, with the help of symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and magnetic dynamics simulations. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Radial Stabilization of Magnetic Skyrmions Under Strong External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skyrmion number density, $q\equiv\vec{n}\cdot\left(\partial_x\vec{n}\times\partial_y\vec{n}\right)/(4\pi)$, is one of the key quantities that characterizes the topological properties of a magnetic skyrmion. In this work, we propose a model for a two-dimensional magnetic system with Hamiltonian that contains an interaction term proportional to $q^2$ which preserves inversion symmetry. The proposed $q^2$ term is also known as the Skyrme term and is a two-dimensional version of the well-known quartic term in models of three-dimensional Hopfions. In contrast with the usual exchange interaction, the $q^2$ term persists at the strong external magnetic field limit. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for micromagnetic calculations, we show that the minimum energy configuration of this model exhibits skyrmion properties. Furthermore, this configuration remains stable under small linear radially symmetric perturbations, and we demonstrate that the total energy of the system is bounded from below, ensuring that it remains above the vacuum energy. This implies a topologically protected configuration. Our model provides a framework for describing skyrmions in materials without broken inversion symmetry, particularly in systems subjected to strong external magnetic fields, where conventional exchange interactions are significantly weaker than the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <title>Extended string-net models with all anyons at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string-net model describes a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Here, we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on these topological phases. In the original string-net model, the description of charge (vertex) excitations can be problematic. Therefore, in order to describe all anyon excitations, we study an extended model [Y. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 195154 (2018)]. Building on recent methods, we compute the spectral degeneracies of excited states and obtain the exact partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that topological order is destroyed at any nonzero temperature. In contrast, in a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, revealing a nontrivial scaling between temperature and size similar to that of the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this scaling by computing the thermal average of several observables such as Wegner-Wilson loops and topological mutual information.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <title>Lorenz ratios of diagonal and Hall conductivities in a Dirac electron liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electron liquid in graphene are analyzed in the hydrodynamic limit under isothermal conditions. It is shown that the Wiedemann-Franz law does not hold in this regime and that the Lorenz ratios constructed from the diagonal and Hall conductivities generally differ from each other. The breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law is most pronounced near charge neutrality, where the Lorenz ratio can exceed its nominal universal Sommerfeld value by an order of magnitude. The corresponding Lorenz ratios exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field, which is caused by emergent magnetic friction arising in liquids lacking Galilean invariance and possessing finite intrinsic conductivity.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>
