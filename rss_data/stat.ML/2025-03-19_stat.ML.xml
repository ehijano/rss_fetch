      <description>arXiv:2503.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate which subsets of the real plane are realisable as the set of points on which a one-layer ReLU neural network takes a positive value. In the case of cones we give a full characterisation of such sets. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for any subset of $\mathbb R^d$. We give various examples of such one-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Micro Text Classification Based on Balanced Positive-Unlabeled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world text classification tasks, negative texts often contain a minimal proportion of negative content, which is especially problematic in areas like text quality control, legal risk screening, and sensitive information interception. This challenge manifests at two levels: at the macro level, distinguishing negative texts is difficult due to the high similarity between coarse-grained positive and negative samples; at the micro level, the issue stems from extreme class imbalance and a lack of fine-grained labels. To address these challenges, we propose transforming the coarse-grained positive-negative (PN) classification task into an imbalanced fine-grained positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem, supported by theoretical analysis. We introduce a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU) learning, which features a unique PU learning loss function that optimizes macro-level performance amidst severe imbalance at the micro level. The framework's performance is further boosted by rebalanced pseudo-labeling and threshold adjustment. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU, which outperforms other methods, even in extreme scenarios where both macro and micro levels are highly imbalanced.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Kernel Regression for Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supervised learning, the output variable to be predicted is often represented as a function, such as a spectrum or probability distribution. Despite its importance, functional output regression remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel functional output regression model based on kernel methods. Unlike conventional approaches that independently train regressors with scalar outputs for each measurement point of the output function, our method leverages the covariance structure within the function values, akin to multitask learning, leading to enhanced learning efficiency and improved prediction accuracy. Compared with existing nonlinear function-on-scalar models in statistical functional data analysis, our model effectively handles high-dimensional nonlinearity while maintaining a simple model structure. Furthermore, the fully kernel-based formulation allows the model to be expressed within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), providing an analytic form for parameter estimation and a solid foundation for further theoretical analysis. The proposed model delivers a functional output predictive distribution derived analytically from a Bayesian perspective, enabling the quantification of uncertainty in the predicted function. We demonstrate the model's enhanced prediction performance through experiments on artificial datasets and density of states prediction tasks in materials science.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ML Training with Metagradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in training large-scale machine learning models is configuring the training process to maximize model performance, i.e., finding the best training setup from a vast design space. In this work, we unlock a gradient-based approach to this problem. We first introduce an algorithm for efficiently calculating metagradients -- gradients through model training -- at scale. We then introduce a "smooth model training" framework that enables effective optimization using metagradients. With metagradient descent (MGD), we greatly improve on existing dataset selection methods, outperform accuracy-degrading data poisoning attacks by an order of magnitude, and automatically find competitive learning rate schedules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Representer Theorem result for a large class of weak formulation problems. We provide examples of applications of our formulation both in traditional machine learning and numerical methods as well as in new and emerging techniques. Finally we apply our formulation to generalize the multivariate occupation kernel (MOCK) method for learning dynamical systems from data proposing the more general Riesz Occupation Kernel (ROCK) method. Our generalized methods are both more computationally efficient and performant on most of the benchmarks we test against.</description>

      <title>Empirical risk minimization algorithm for multiclass classification of S.D.E. paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the multiclass classification problem for stochastic diffusion paths, assuming that the classes are distinguished by their drift functions, while the diffusion coefficient remains common across all classes. In this setting, we propose a classification algorithm that relies on the minimization of the L 2 risk. We establish rates of convergence for the resulting predictor. Notably, we introduce a margin assumption under which we show that our procedure can achieve fast rates of convergence. Finally, a simulation study highlights the numerical performance of our classification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Optimizing High-Dimensional Oblique Splits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal-split trees perform well, but evidence suggests oblique splits can enhance their performance. This paper explores optimizing high-dimensional $s$-sparse oblique splits from $\{(\vec{w}, \vec{w}^{\top}\boldsymbol{X}_{i}) : i\in \{1,\dots, n\}, \vec{w} \in \mathbb{R}^p, \| \vec{w} \|_{2} = 1, \| \vec{w} \|_{0} \leq s \}$ for growing oblique trees, where $ s $ is a user-defined sparsity parameter. We establish a connection between SID convergence and $s_0$-sparse oblique splits with $s_0\ge 1$, showing that the SID function class expands as $s_0$ increases, enabling the capture of more complex data-generating functions such as the $s_0$-dimensional XOR function. Thus, $s_0$ represents the unknown potential complexity of the underlying data-generating function. Learning these complex functions requires an $s$-sparse oblique tree with $s \geq s_0$ and greater computational resources. This highlights a trade-off between statistical accuracy, governed by the SID function class size depending on $s_0$, and computational cost. In contrast, previous studies have explored the problem of SID convergence using orthogonal splits with $ s_0 = s = 1 $, where runtime was less critical. Additionally, we introduce a practical framework for oblique trees that integrates optimized oblique splits alongside orthogonal splits into random forests. The proposed approach is assessed through simulations and real-data experiments, comparing its performance against various oblique tree models.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Probabilistic Numerics via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of an uncertainty set. Due to model misspecification, the uncertainty set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the uncertainty sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust identification of treatment effects from multiple environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical and ethical constraints often require the use of observational data for causal inference, particularly in medicine and social sciences. Yet, observational datasets are prone to confounding, potentially compromising the validity of causal conclusions. While it is possible to correct for biases if the underlying causal graph is known, this is rarely a feasible ask in practical scenarios. A common strategy is to adjust for all available covariates, yet this approach can yield biased treatment effect estimates, especially when post-treatment or unobserved variables are present. We propose RAMEN, an algorithm that produces unbiased treatment effect estimates by leveraging the heterogeneity of multiple data sources without the need to know or learn the underlying causal graph. Notably, RAMEN achieves doubly robust identification: it can identify the treatment effect whenever the causal parents of the treatment or those of the outcome are observed, and the node whose parents are observed satisfies an invariance assumption. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured variable selection priors for multi-omics biomarker identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important goal in cancer research is the survival prognosis of a patient based on a minimal panel of genomic and molecular markers such as genes or proteins. Purely data-driven models without any biological knowledge can produce non-interpretable results. We propose a penalized semiparametric Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured selection priors for sparse identification of multi-omics features by making use of a biologically meaningful graph via a Markov random field (MRF) prior to capturing known relationships between multi-omics features. Since the fixed graph in the MRF prior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to determine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known information and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for drawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable and stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to methods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The results also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a partially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where not all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can still be useful. The proposed model is applied to the primary invasive breast cancer patients data in The Cancer Genome Atlas project.</description>

      <title>The Role of Hyperparameters in Predictive Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of hyperparameters in predictive multiplicity, where different machine learning models trained on the same dataset yield divergent predictions for identical inputs. These inconsistencies can seriously impact high-stakes decisions such as credit assessments, hiring, and medical diagnoses. Focusing on six widely used models for tabular data - Elastic Net, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - we explore how hyperparameter tuning influences predictive multiplicity, as expressed by the distribution of prediction discrepancies across benchmark datasets. Key hyperparameters such as lambda in Elastic Net, gamma in Support Vector Machines, and alpha in Extreme Gradient Boosting play a crucial role in shaping predictive multiplicity, often compromising the stability of predictions within specific algorithms. Our experiments on 21 benchmark datasets reveal that tuning these hyperparameters leads to notable performance improvements but also increases prediction discrepancies, with Extreme Gradient Boosting exhibiting the highest discrepancy and substantial prediction instability. This highlights the trade-off between performance optimization and prediction consistency, raising concerns about the risk of arbitrary predictions. These findings provide insight into how hyperparameter optimization leads to predictive multiplicity. While predictive multiplicity allows prioritizing domain-specific objectives such as fairness and reduces reliance on a single model, it also complicates decision-making, potentially leading to arbitrary or unjustified outcomes.</description>

      <title>How many simulations do we need for simulation-based inference in cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many simulations do we need to train machine learning methods to extract information available from summary statistics of the cosmological density field? Neural methods have shown the potential to extract non-linear information available from cosmological data. Success depends critically on having sufficient simulations for training the networks and appropriate network architectures. In the first detailed convergence study of neural network training for cosmological inference, we show that currently available simulation suites, such as the Quijote Latin Hypercube(LH) with 2000 simulations, do not provide sufficient training data for a generic neural network to reach the optimal regime, even for the dark matter power spectrum, and in an idealized case. We discover an empirical neural scaling law that predicts how much information a neural network can extract from a highly informative summary statistic, the dark matter power spectrum, as a function of the number of simulations used to train the network, for a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We combine this result with the Cramer-Rao information bound to forecast the number of training simulations needed for near-optimal information extraction. To verify our method we created the largest publicly released simulation data set in cosmology, the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ), consisting of 32,768 $\Lambda$CDM n-body simulations uniformly covering the $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. Our method enables efficient planning of simulation campaigns for machine learning applications in cosmology, while the BSQ dataset provides an unprecedented resource for studying the convergence behavior of neural networks in cosmological parameter inference. Our results suggest that new large simulation suites or new training approaches will be necessary to achieve information-optimal parameter inference from non-linear simulations.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual experience augmented off-policy reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning control algorithms face significant challenges due to out-of-distribution and inefficient exploration problems. While model-based reinforcement learning enhances the agent's reasoning and planning capabilities by constructing virtual environments, training such virtual environments can be very complex. In order to build an efficient inference model and enhance the representativeness of learning data, we propose the Counterfactual Experience Augmentation (CEA) algorithm. CEA leverages variational autoencoders to model the dynamic patterns of state transitions and introduces randomness to model non-stationarity. This approach focuses on expanding the learning data in the experience pool through counterfactual inference and performs exceptionally well in environments that follow the bisimulation assumption. Environments with bisimulation properties are usually represented by discrete observation and action spaces, we propose a sampling method based on maximum kernel density estimation entropy to extend CEA to various environments. By providing reward signals for counterfactual state transitions based on real information, CEA constructs a complete counterfactual experience to alleviate the out-of-distribution problem of the learning data, and outperforms general SOTA algorithms in environments with difference properties. Finally, we discuss the similarities, differences and properties of generated counterfactual experiences and real experiences. The code is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/CEA.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a Wasserstein-type distance for Gaussian mixture models has been proposed. However, that framework can only be generalized to identifiable mixtures of general elliptically contoured distributions whose components come from the same family and satisfy marginal consistency. In this paper, we propose a simple relaxed Wasserstein distance for identifiable mixtures of radially contoured distributions whose components can come from different families. We show some properties of this distance and that its definition does not require marginal consistency. We apply this distance in color transfer tasks and compare its performance with the Wasserstein-type distance for Gaussian mixture models in an experiment. The error of our method is more stable and the color distribution of our output image is more desirable.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Uncertainties in Probabilistic Deep Neural Network by Implementing Boosting of Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neural network architectures have achieved remarkable accuracies but remain highly dependent on their training data, often lacking interpretability in their learned mappings. While effective on large datasets, they tend to overfit on smaller ones. Probabilistic neural networks, such as those utilizing variational inference, address this limitation by incorporating uncertainty estimation through weight distributions rather than point estimates. However, standard variational inference often relies on a single-density approximation, which can lead to poor posterior estimates and hinder model performance. We propose Boosted Bayesian Neural Networks (BBNN), a novel approach that enhances neural network weight distribution approximations using Boosting Variational Inference (BVI). By iteratively constructing a mixture of densities, BVI expands the approximating family, enabling a more expressive posterior that leads to improved generalization and uncertainty estimation. While this approach increases computational complexity, it significantly enhances accuracy an essential tradeoff, particularly in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnostics, where false negatives can have severe consequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that BBNN achieves ~5% higher accuracy compared to conventional neural networks while providing superior uncertainty quantification. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of leveraging a mixture-based variational family to better approximate the posterior distribution, ultimately advancing probabilistic deep learning.</description>

      <title>Developing cholera outbreak forecasting through qualitative dynamics: Insights into Malawi case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reliable uncertainty quantification for 2D/3D anatomical landmark localization using multi-output conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic anatomical landmark localization in medical imaging requires not just accurate predictions but reliable uncertainty quantification for effective clinical decision support. Current uncertainty quantification approaches often fall short, particularly when combined with normality assumptions, systematically underestimating total predictive uncertainty. This paper introduces conformal prediction as a framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in anatomical landmark localization, addressing a critical gap in automatic landmark localization. We present two novel approaches guaranteeing finite-sample validity for multi-output prediction: Multi-output Regression-as-Classification Conformal Prediction (M-R2CCP) and its variant Multi-output Regression to Classification Conformal Prediction set to Region (M-R2C2R). Unlike conventional methods that produce axis-aligned hyperrectangular or ellipsoidal regions, our approaches generate flexible, non-convex prediction regions that better capture the underlying uncertainty structure of landmark predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across multiple 2D and 3D datasets, we demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing multi-output conformal prediction approaches in both validity and efficiency. This work represents a significant advancement in reliable uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark localization, providing clinicians with trustworthy confidence measures for their diagnoses. While developed for medical imaging, these methods show promise for broader applications in multi-output regression problems.</description>

      <title>Improved Scalable Lipschitz Bounds for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing tight Lipschitz bounds for deep neural networks is crucial for analyzing their robustness and stability, but existing approaches either produce relatively conservative estimates or rely on semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations (namely the LipSDP condition) that face scalability issues. Building upon ECLipsE-Fast, the state-of-the-art Lipschitz bound method that avoids SDP formulations, we derive a new family of improved scalable Lipschitz bounds that can be combined to outperform ECLipsE-Fast. Specifically, we leverage more general parameterizations of feasible points of LipSDP to derive various closed-form Lipschitz bounds, avoiding the use of SDP solvers. In addition, we show that our technique encompasses ECLipsE-Fast as a special case and leads to a much larger class of scalable Lipschitz bounds for deep neural networks. Our empirical study shows that our bounds improve ECLipsE-Fast, further advancing the scalability and precision of Lipschitz estimation for large neural networks.</description>

      <title>Landscape Complexity for the Empirical Risk of Generalized Linear Models: Discrimination between Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Kac-Rice formula and results from random matrix theory to obtain the average number of critical points of a family of high-dimensional empirical loss functions, where the data are correlated $d$-dimensional Gaussian vectors, whose number has a fixed ratio with their dimension. The correlations are introduced to model the existence of structure in the data, as is common in current Machine-Learning systems. Under a technical hypothesis, our results are exact in the large-$d$ limit, and characterize the annealed landscape complexity, namely the logarithm of the expected number of critical points at a given value of the loss.
  We first address in detail the landscape of the loss function of a single perceptron and then generalize it to the case where two competing data sets with different covariance matrices are present, with the perceptron seeking to discriminate between them. The latter model can be applied to understand the interplay between adversity and non-trivial data structure. For completeness, we also treat the case of a loss function used in training Generalized Linear Models in the presence of correlated input data.</description>

      <title>Unfair Utilities and First Steps Towards Improving Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fairness criteria constrain the policy or choice of predictors, which can have unwanted consequences, in particular, when optimizing the policy under such constraints. Here, we advocate to instead focus on the utility function the policy is optimizing for. We define value of information fairness and propose to not use utility functions that violate this criterion. This principle suggests to modify these utility functions such that they satisfy value of information fairness. We describe how this can be done and discuss consequences for the corresponding optimal policies. We apply our framework to thought experiments and the COMPAS data. Focussing on the utility function provides better answers than existing fairness notions: We are not aware of any intuitively fair policy that is disallowed by value of information fairness, and when we find that value of information fairness recommends an intuitively unfair policy, no existing fairness notion finds an intuitively fair policy.</description>

      <title>Kernel Single Proxy Control for Deterministic Confounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of causal effect estimation with an unobserved confounder, where we observe a single proxy variable that is associated with the confounder. Although it has been shown that the recovery of an average causal effect is impossible in general from a single proxy variable, we show that causal recovery is possible if the outcome is generated deterministically. This generalizes existing work on causal methods with a single proxy variable to the continuous treatment setting. We propose two kernel-based methods for this setting: the first based on the two-stage regression approach, and the second based on a maximum moment restriction approach. We prove that both approaches can consistently estimate the causal effect, and we empirically demonstrate that we can successfully recover the causal effect on challenging synthetic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Kernel Stein Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel methods underpin many of the most successful approaches in data science and statistics, and they allow representing probability measures as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space without loss of information. Recently, the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which combines Stein's method with the flexibility of kernel techniques, gained considerable attention. Through the Stein operator, KSD allows the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U- and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which hinders their application in large-scale settings. In this work, we propose a Nystr\"om-based KSD acceleration -- with runtime $\mathcal O\left(mn+m^3\right)$ for $n$ samples and $m\ll n$ Nystr\"om points -- , show its $\sqrt{n}$-consistency with a classical sub-Gaussian assumption, and demonstrate its applicability for goodness-of-fit testing on a suite of benchmarks. We also show the $\sqrt n$-consistency of the quadratic-time KSD estimator.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of a Federated Expectation-Maximization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity has been a long-standing bottleneck in studying the convergence rates of Federated Learning algorithms. In order to better understand the issue of data heterogeneity, we study the convergence rate of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the Federated Mixture of $K$ Linear Regressions model (FMLR). We completely characterize the convergence rate of the EM algorithm under all regimes of $m/n$ where $m$ is the number of clients and $n$ is the number of data points per client. We show that with a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of order $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, the well-initialized EM algorithm converges within the minimax distance of the ground truth under all regimes. Interestingly, we identify that when the number of clients grows reasonably with respect to the number of data points per client, the EM algorithm only requires a constant number of iterations to converge. We perform experiments on synthetic data to illustrate our results. In line with our theoretical findings, the simulations show that rather than being a bottleneck, data heterogeneity can accelerate the convergence of iterative federated algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are popular generative models used to sample from complex data distributions. Despite their empirical success in various machine learning tasks, significant gaps remain in understanding their theoretical properties, particularly regarding convergence guarantees. This paper aims to bridge that gap by providing non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for VAE trained using both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Adam algorithms.We derive a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log n / \sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, the number of variational samples, and other key hyperparameters. Our theoretical analysis applies to both Linear VAE and Deep Gaussian VAE, as well as several VAE variants, including $\beta$-VAE and IWAE. Additionally, we empirically illustrate the impact of hyperparameters on convergence, offering new insights into the theoretical understanding of VAE training.</description>

      <title>Learning an Optimal Assortment Policy under Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.</description>

      <title>Clustering Items through Bandit Feedback: Finding the Right Feature out of Many</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering a set of items based on bandit feedback. Each of the $n$ items is characterized by a feature vector, with a possibly large dimension $d$. The items are  partitioned into two unknown groups such that items within the same group share the same feature vector. We consider a sequential and adaptive setting in which, at each round, the learner selects one item and one feature, then observes a noisy evaluation of the item's feature. The learner's objective is to recover the correct partition of the items, while keeping the number of observations as small as possible. We provide an algorithm which relies on finding a relevant feature for the clustering task, leveraging the Sequential Halving algorithm. With probability at least $1-\delta$, we obtain an accurate recovery of the partition and derive an upper bound on the budget required. Furthermore, we derive an instance-dependent lower bound, which is tight in some relevant cases.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>

      <title>E-Values Expand the Scope of Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. The standard approach to conformal prediction relies on comparing the ranks of prediction scores: under exchangeability, the rank of a future test point cannot be too extreme relative to a calibration set. This rank-based method can be reformulated in terms of p-values. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on e-values, known as conformal e-prediction. E-values offer key advantages that cannot be achieved with p-values, enabling new theoretical and practical capabilities. In particular, we present three applications that leverage the unique strengths of e-values: batch anytime-valid conformal prediction, fixed-size conformal sets with data-dependent coverage, and conformal prediction under ambiguous ground truth. Overall, these examples demonstrate that e-value-based constructions provide a flexible expansion of the toolbox of conformal prediction.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks often operate in the overparameterized regime, in which there are far more parameters than training samples, allowing the training data to be fit perfectly. That is, training the network effectively learns an interpolating function, and properties of the interpolant affect predictions the network will make on new samples. This manuscript explores how properties of such functions learned by neural networks of depth greater than two layers. Our framework considers a family of networks of varying depths that all have the same capacity but different representation costs. The representation cost of a function induced by a neural network architecture is the minimum sum of squared weights needed for the network to represent the function; it reflects the function space bias associated with the architecture. Our results show that adding additional linear layers to the input side of a shallow ReLU network yields a representation cost favoring functions with low mixed variation -- that is, it has limited variation in directions orthogonal to a low-dimensional subspace and can be well approximated by a single- or multi-index model. This bias occurs because minimizing the sum of squared weights of the linear layers is equivalent to minimizing a low-rank promoting Schatten quasi-norm of a single "virtual" weight matrix. Our experiments confirm this behavior in standard network training regimes. They additionally show that linear layers can improve generalization and the learned network is well-aligned with the true latent low-dimensional linear subspace when data is generated using a multi-index model.</description>

      <title>Max-Rank: Efficient Multiple Testing for Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) frequently arises in scientific inquiries, and concurrent testing of multiple hypotheses inflates the risk of Type-I errors or false positives, rendering MHT corrections essential. This paper addresses MHT in the context of conformal prediction, a flexible framework for predictive uncertainty quantification. Some conformal applications give rise to simultaneous testing, and positive dependencies among tests typically exist. We introduce $\texttt{max-rank}$, a novel correction that exploits these dependencies whilst efficiently controlling the family-wise error rate. Inspired by existing permutation-based corrections, $\texttt{max-rank}$ leverages rank order information to improve performance and integrates readily with any conformal procedure. We establish its theoretical and empirical advantages over the common Bonferroni correction and its compatibility with conformal prediction, highlighting the potential to strengthen predictive uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Preserving Calibration via Statistical Modeling on Probability Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) must be calibrated to measure the reliability of predictions. Some recent calibration methods have employed a probabilistic model on the probability simplex. However, these calibration methods cannot preserve the accuracy of pre-trained models, even those with a high classification accuracy. We propose an accuracy-preserving calibration method using the Concrete distribution as the probabilistic model on the probability simplex. We theoretically prove that a DNN model trained on cross-entropy loss has optimality as the parameter of the Concrete distribution. We also propose an efficient method that synthetically generates samples for training probabilistic models on the probability simplex. We demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform previous methods in accuracy-preserving calibration tasks using benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/SimplexTS.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's counterfactual outcomes under interventions is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in the observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage disentangled exogenous noise abduction that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory of Bias Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can capture and amplify biases present in data, leading to disparate test performance across social groups. To better understand, evaluate, and mitigate these biases, a deeper theoretical understanding of how model design choices and data distribution properties contribute to bias is needed. In this work, we contribute a precise analytical theory in the context of ridge regression, both with and without random projections, where the former models feedforward neural networks in a simplified regime. Our theory offers a unified and rigorous explanation of machine learning bias, providing insights into phenomena such as bias amplification and minority-group bias in various feature and parameter regimes. For example, we observe that there may be an optimal regularization penalty or training time to avoid bias amplification, and there can be differences in test error between groups that are not alleviated with increased parameterization. Importantly, our theoretical predictions align with empirical observations reported in the literature on machine learning bias. We extensively empirically validate our theory on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Powerful batch conformal prediction for classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a split conformal framework with $K$ classes, a calibration sample of $n$ labeled examples is observed for inference on the label of a new unlabeled example. We explore the setting where a `batch' of $m$ independent such unlabeled examples is given, and the goal is to construct a batch prediction set with 1-$\alpha$ coverage. Unlike individual prediction sets, the batch prediction set is a collection of label vectors of size $m$, while the calibration sample consists of univariate labels. A natural approach is to apply the Bonferroni correction, which concatenates individual prediction sets at level $1-\alpha/m$. We propose a uniformly more powerful solution, based on specific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit the Simes inequality. We provide a general recipe for valid inference with any combinations of conformal $p$-values, and compare the performance of several useful choices. Intuitively, the pooled evidence of relatively `easy' examples within the batch can help provide narrower batch prediction sets. Additionally, we introduce a more computationally intensive method that aggregates batch scores and can be even more powerful. The theoretical guarantees are established when all examples are independent and identically distributed (iid), as well as more generally when iid is assumed only conditionally within each class. Notably, our results remain valid under label distribution shift, since the distribution of the labels need not be the same in the calibration sample and in the new batch. The effectiveness of the methods is highlighted through illustrative synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Influence functions and regularity tangents for efficient active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe an efficient method for providing a regression model with a sense of curiosity about its data. In the field of machine learning, our framework for representing curiosity is called Active Learning, which concerns the problem of automatically choosing data points for which to query labels in the semi-supervised setting. The methods we propose are based on computing a "regularity tangent" vector that can be calculated (with only a constant slow-down) together with the model's parameter vector during training. We then take the inner product of this tangent vector with the gradient vector of the model's loss at a given data point to obtain a measure of the influence of that point on the complexity of the model. In the simplest instantiation, there is only a single regularity tangent vector, of the same dimension as the parameter vector. Thus, in the proposed technique, once training is complete, evaluating our "curiosity" about a potential query data point can be done as quickly as calculating the model's loss gradient at that point. The new vector only doubles the amount of storage required by the model. We show that the quantity computed by our technique is an example of an "influence function", and that it measures the expected squared change in model complexity incurred by up-weighting a given data point. We propose a number of ways for using this and other related quantities to choose new training data points for a regression model.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</description>

      <title>Debiased Nonparametric Regression for Statistical Inference and Distributionally Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a debiasing method for smooth nonparametric estimators. While machine learning techniques such as random forests and neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive performance, their theoretical properties remain relatively underexplored. In particular, many modern algorithms lack guarantees of pointwise and uniform risk convergence, as well as asymptotic normality. These properties are essential for statistical inference and robust estimation and have been well-established for classical methods such as Nadaraya-Watson regression. To ensure these properties for various nonparametric regression estimators, we introduce a model-free debiasing method. By incorporating a correction term that estimates the conditional expected residual of the original estimator, or equivalently, its estimation error, into the initial nonparametric regression estimator, we obtain a debiased estimator that satisfies pointwise and uniform risk convergence, along with asymptotic normality, under mild smoothness conditions. These properties facilitate statistical inference and enhance robustness to covariate shift, making the method broadly applicable to a wide range of nonparametric regression problems.</description>

      <title>When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at https://github.com/dayal-kalra/low-memory-adam.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction and Human Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions from arbitrary models are in demand in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance. Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular method for producing a set of predictions with specified average coverage, in place of a single prediction and confidence value. However, the value of conformal prediction sets to assist human decisions remains elusive due to the murky relationship between coverage guarantees and decision makers' goals and strategies. How should we think about conformal prediction sets as a form of decision support? We outline a decision theoretic framework for evaluating predictive uncertainty as informative signals, then contrast what can be said within this framework about idealized use of calibrated probabilities versus conformal prediction sets. Informed by prior empirical results and theories of human decisions under uncertainty, we formalize a set of possible strategies by which a decision maker might use a prediction set. We identify ways in which conformal prediction sets and posthoc predictive uncertainty quantification more broadly are in tension with common goals and needs in human-AI decision making. We give recommendations for future research in predictive uncertainty quantification to support human decision makers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective uncertainty quantification is important for training modern predictive models with limited data, enhancing both accuracy and robustness. While Bayesian methods are effective for this purpose, they can be challenging to scale. When employing approximate Bayesian inference, ensuring the quality of samples from the posterior distribution in a computationally efficient manner is essential. This paper addresses the estimation of the Bayesian posterior to generate diverse samples by approximating the gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the cross entropy of the target approximation under the metric induced by the Stein Operator. It presents empirical evaluations on classification tasks to assess the method's performance and discuss its effectiveness for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning that uses uncertainty-aware network dynamics models.</description>
