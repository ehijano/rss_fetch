      <title>Throughput-Optimal Random Access: A Queueing-Theoretical Analysis for Learning-Based Access Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random access networks have long been observed to suffer from low throughput if nodes' access strategy is not properly designed. To improve the throughput performance, learning-based approaches, with which each node learns from the observations and experience to determine its own access strategy, have shown immense potential, but are often designed empirically due to the lack of theoretical guidance. As we will demonstrate in this paper, the queueing-theoretical analysis can be leveraged as a powerful tool for optimal design of learning-based access. Specifically, based on a Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) framework, two random access schemes, MTOA-L with local rewards and MTOA-G with global rewards, are proposed for throughput optimization. Though both can achieve the maximum throughput of 1, they have different short-term fairness performance. Through identifying the access strategies learned via MTOA-L and MTOA-G and feeding them into the proposed unified queueing-theoretical framework, the throughput-fairness tradeoff of each is characterized and optimized by properly tuning the key parameters. The comparison of the optimal tradeoffs shows that MTOA-G is much superior to MTOA-L especially when the number of nodes is large.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Movement Sampling Physics-Informed Residual Network (AM-PIRN) for Solving Nonlinear Option Pricing models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Movement Sampling Physics-Informed Residual Network (AM-PIRN) to address challenges in solving nonlinear option pricing PDE models, where solutions often exhibit significant curvature or shock waves over time. The AM-PIRN architecture is designed to concurrently minimize PDE residuals and achieve high-fidelity option price approximations by dynamically redistributing training points based on evolving PDE residuals, while maintaining a fixed total number of points. To enhance stability and training efficiency, we integrate a ResNet backbone, replacing conventional fully connected neural networks used in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Numerical experiments across nonlinear option pricing models demonstrate that AM-PIRN outperforms PINN, RAM-PINN, and WAM-PINN in both resolving PDE constraints and accurately estimating option prices. The method's advantages are particularly pronounced in complex or multi-dimensional models, where its adaptive sampling and robust architecture effectively mitigate challenges posed by sharp gradients and high nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Leggiero: Analog WiFi Backscatter with Payload Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter is an enabling technology for battery-free sensing in today's Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIOT). Building a backscatter-based sensing system, however, is a daunting task, due to two obstacles: the unaffordable power consumption of the microprocessor and the coexistence with the ambient carrier's traffic. In order to address the above issues, in this paper, we present Leggiero, the first-of-its-kind analog WiFi backscatter with payload transparency. Leveraging a specially designed circuit with a varactor diode, this design avoids using a microprocessor to interface between the radio and the sensor, and directly converts the analog sensor signal into the phase of RF (radio frequency) signal. By carefully designing the reference circuit on the tag and precisely locating the extra long training field (LTF) section of a WiFi packet, Leggiero embeds the analog phase value into the channel state information (CSI). A commodity WiFi receiver without hardware modification can simultaneously decode the WiFi and the sensor data. We implement Leggiero design and evaluate its performance under varied settings. The results show that the power consumption of the Leggiero tag (excluding the power of the peripheral sensor module) is 30uW at a sampling rate of 400Hz, which is 4.8* and 4* lower than the state-of-the-art WiFi backscatter schemes. The uplink throughput of Leggiero is suficient to support a variety of sensing applications, while keeping the WiFi carrier's throughput performance unaffected.</description>

      <title>QuinID: Enabling FDMA-Based Fully Parallel RFID with Frequency-Selective Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallelizing passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reading is an arguably crucial, yet unsolved challenge in modern IoT applications. Existing approaches remain limited to time-division operations and fail to read multiple tags simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce QuinID, the first frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) RFID system to achieve fully parallel reading. We innovatively exploit the frequency selectivity of the tag antenna rather than a conventional digital FDMA, bypassing the power and circuitry constraint of RFID tags. Specifically, we delicately design the frequency-selective antenna based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) components to achieve extreme narrow-band response, so that QuinID tags (i.e., QuinTags) operate exclusively within their designated frequency bands. By carefully designing the matching network and canceling various interference, a customized QuinReader communicates simultaneously with multiple QuinTags across distinct bands. QuinID maintains high compatibility with commercial RFID systems and presents a tag cost of less than 10 cents. We implement a 5-band QuinID system and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results demonstrate a fivefold increase in read rate, reaching up to 5000 reads per second.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Learning for Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.</description>

      <title>CAMINO: Cloud-native Autonomous Management and Intent-based Orchestrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CAMINO, a Cloud-native Autonomous Management and Intent-based Orchestrator designed to address the challenges of scalable, declarative, and cloud-native service management and orchestration. CAMINO leverages a modular architecture, the Configuration-as-Data (CaD) paradigm, and real-time resource monitoring to facilitate zero-touch provisioning across multi-edge infrastructure. By incorporating intent-driven orchestration and observability capabilities, CAMINO enables automated lifecycle management of network functions, ensuring optimized resource utilisation. The proposed solution abstracts complex configurations into high-level intents, offering a scalable approach to orchestrating services in distributed cloud-native infrastructures. This paper details CAMINO's system architecture, implementation, and key benefits, highlighting its effectiveness in cloud-native telecommunications environments.</description>
