      <title>Cloud and Haze Parameterization in Atmospheric Retrievals: Insights from Titan's Cassini Data and JWST Observations of Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Before JWST, telescope observations were not sensitive enough to constrain the nature of clouds in exo-atmospheres. Recent observations, however, have inferred cloud signatures as well as haze-enhanced scattering slopes motivating the need for modern inversion techniques and a deeper understanding of the JWST information content.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the information content of JWST exoplanet spectra. We particularly focus on designing an inversion technique able to handle a wide range of cloud and hazes.
  Methods: We build a flexible aerosol parameterization within the TauREx framework, enabling us to conduct atmospheric retrievals of planetary atmospheres. The method is evaluated on available Cassini occultations of Titan. We then use the model to interpret the recent JWST data for the prototypical hot Jupiters HAT-P-18 b, WASP-39 b, WASP-96 b, and WASP-107 b. In parallel, we perform complementary simulations on controlled scenarios to further understand the information content of JWST data and provide parameterization guidelines.
  Results: Our results use free and kinetic chemistry retrievals to extract the main atmospheric properties of key JWST exoplanets, including their molecular abundances, thermal structures, and aerosol properties. In our investigations, we show the need for a wide wavelength coverage to robustly characterize clouds and hazes-which is necessary to mitigate biases arising from our lack of priors on their composition-and break degeneracies with atmospheric chemical composition. With JWST, the characterization of clouds and hazes might be difficult due to the lack of simultaneous wavelength coverage from visible to mid-infrared by a single instruments and the likely presence of temporal variability between visits (from e.g., observing conditions, instrument systematics, stellar host variability, or planetary weather).</description>

      <title>Orbital Decay of the Shortest-Period Hot Jupiter, TOI-2109b: Tidal Constraints and Transit-Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-2109b is the hot Jupiter with the shortest orbital period ($\sim16\,$hr). At this close distance, strong tidal interactions can produce a significant exchange of angular momentum with the star. Since the orbital period of this planet is shorter than the stellar rotation period, TOI-2109b may be an optimal candidate for studying orbital decay. This process depends on how efficiently the star and the planet dissipate energy, due mainly to interior mechanisms that are poorly constrained in exoplanet systems. In this work, we study for the first time the tidal evolution of TOI-2109b under a formalism of inertial waves (IWs) in convective envelopes and internal gravity waves (IGWs) in stellar radiative regions. We find that uncertainties in the age of TOI-2109 ($t_\mathrm{\star, age}$) significantly affect the rate of orbital evolution, as IWs and IGWs interact differently depending on $t_\mathrm{\star, age}$. For an 'old' host star, we find that TOI-2109b would undergo fast orbital decay. Conversely, if TOI-2109b orbits a 'young' host star, a rather slow decay rate for $Q_\star'&gt;2.3\times10^7$ would suggest a constant-period orbit. Our calculated mid-transit times and transit-timing variations (TTVs) support a 'young' host star with $Q_\star'&gt;3.7\times10^7$, suggesting a decay rate of $\dot{P}\sim4\,$ms yr$^{-1}$ that could lead to mid-transit-time shifts $\lesssim10\,$s over three years. Orbital decay and other TTV-inducing effects will be confirmed or ruled out with future higher-quality timing data. The results presented here aim at constraining the current modeling of tides and TTVs for TOI-2109b, helping us further understand those light-curve changes associated to the long-term evolution of ultra-short-period planets.</description>

      <title>Coupled shape and spin evolution of small near spherical asteroids due to global regolith motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent space missions have provided substantial evidence of regolith movement on the surfaces of near Earth asteroids. To investigate this phenomenon, we present a continuum-based model that describes regolith motion on nearly spherical asteroids. The theoretical framework employs a depth averaged approach, traditionally used for simulating terrestrial landslides, and is extended to include additional terms that account for spherical geometry, shallow topography and the asteroids rotation. The governing equations couple the resurfacing process with the asteroids spin evolution through angular momentum conservation. The axisymmetric form of these equations is then employed to study the transition of an initially spherical asteroid into a top-shaped.</description>

      <title>EBLM XV -- Revised dynamical masses for the circumbinary planet host Kepler-16 AB, using the SOPHIE spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries are perfect laboratories to measure precise, accurate and model-independent stellar radii and stellar masses, so long as both components are spectroscopically resolved. Resolving both components is difficult in high-contrast binaries, for instance, those composed of an FGK main-sequence star with an M-type companion. In those cases, the secondary can contribute &lt;1% of the total flux in optical wavelengths. This makes measuring dynamical masses challenging and has typically only been attempted with large-aperture telescopes (8-10-m). The High-Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS) method was developed to extract weak emission and transmission spectra for exoplanet atmospheres. This method was recently adapted and applied to measure dynamical masses in high-contrast binaries. In this work, we apply the HRCCS method to optical spectra of the high-contrast binary and circumbinary planet host Kepler-16AB, obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The secondary, which has a contrast ratio of ~ 6 x 10-3, is resolved with a detection significance of 9.5-sigma. We derive dynamical masses with a precision of 1.5% and 0.9% for the primary and secondary respectively. These are comparable, but slightly higher (within 2-7%) to previous mass-measurements, which has -- within the uncertainties -- no implication for the mass of the known circumbinary planet. This work demonstrates that dynamical mass measurements of high-contrast binaries can be done with 2-m class telescopes. We also investigate different analysis protocols to ensure we derive robust uncertainties for dynamical masses.</description>

      <title>Comparing Grid Model Fitting Methodologies for Low-Temperature Atmospheres: Markov Chain Monte Carlo versus Random Forest Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of low-temperature stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets are challenging to model due to strong molecular features and complex gas and condensate chemistry. Self-consistent atmosphere models are commonly used for spectral fitting, but computational limits restrict the production of finely-sampled multi-dimensional parameter grids, necessitating interpolation methods to infer precise parameters and uncertainties. Here, we compare two grid-model fitting approaches: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm interpolating across spectral fluxes, and a Random Forest Retrieval (RFR) algorithm trained on a grid model set. We test these with three low-temperature model grids -- Sonora Diamondback, Sonora Elf Owl, and Spectral ANalog of Dwarfs (SAND) -- and a sample of eleven L and T dwarf companions to FGKM stars with known distances, compositions, and ages. Diamondback models are optimal for early- and mid-type L dwarfs, Elf Owl for mid- and late T dwarfs, and SAND for young L dwarfs and L/T transition objects. The MCMC approach yields higher fit quality and more precise parameters, though best-fit parameters are generally consistent between approaches. RFR analysis is orders of magnitude faster after training. Both approaches yield mixed results when comparing fit parameters to expected values based on primary (metallicity and surface gravity) or evolutionary models (temperature and radius). We propose modeling low-temperature spectra efficiently by first fitting multiple model sets using RFR, followed by a more accurate MCMC assessment, to accelerate improved grid development.</description>

      <title>Cold Jupiters and small planets: friends, foes, or indifferent? A search for correlations with the largest exoplanet samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding out whether there is any correlation between the presence of short-period small planets (SPs) with $P\lesssim100~d$ ($a \lesssim0.4~AU$) and $1&lt;M_{p}&lt;20~M_\oplus$ and that of outer cold Jupiters (CJs) with $a=1-10~AU$ and $M_{p}=0.5-20~M_{Jup}$ around solar-type stars may provide crucial constraints on the models of formation and/or migration of SPs. However, somehow discrepant results about the occurrence rates of CJs in SP systems have been reported in the literature, with a few recent works claiming a strong SP-CJ correlation but only at super-solar metallicity and/or mass of the host stars. Here we homogeneously recomputed the occurrence rates of CJs at average, sub-solar ($[Fe/H]&lt;-0.1$), solar ($-0.1\le[Fe/H]\le0.1$), and super-solar ($[Fe/H]&gt;0.1$) metallicity as well as at average and sub-intervals of stellar mass, namely 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, and 1.0-1.2 $M_\odot$, with (i) a carefully-selected sample of 217 SP systems, and (ii) a large comparison sample of 1167 solar-type stars. We determined the integrated occurrence rate of CJs in SP systems to be $f_{CJ|SP}=11.1^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\%$; this is consistent with the estimated frequencies of CJs in both the comparison sample ($f_{CJ}=9.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\%$) and the HARPS-N survey of transiting SP systems. We found a possible correlation ($f_{CJ|SP}&gt;f_{CJ}$) only at super-solar mass and metallicity, though with a statistical confidence less than $3\sigma$. To test some theoretical predictions, we also searched for possible SP-CJ relations as a function of SP and CJ multiplicity as well as SP composition, and found none. We show that the architectures of SP systems are not indifferent to the presence of CJs as the multiplicity of SPs strongly depends on the CJ eccentricity, as expected from planetary dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the relation between SPs and CJs requires larger samples of SP systems. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>The Impact of Fiber Cross Contamination on Radial Velocity Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectrographs with precise radial velocity (PRV) capabilities require careful considerations in instrumental design and data processing in order to reach the 10 cm/s-level precision, which is needed for detecting Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate the impact of fiber cross contamination on the RV precision via simulations, as modern PRV spectrographs often have multiple fiber traces on their spectral images. We simulated extracted 1-D spectra under the preliminary design of CHORUS, short for the Canary Hybrid Optical high-Resolution Ultra-stable Spectrograph, a dual-arm PRV spectrograph under construction for the Gran Telescopio de Canarias. We considered two types of fiber cross contaminations: contamination from calibration traces to neighboring science traces (or cal-sci contamination) and between science traces (or sci-sci contamination). We present results in four different scenarios: photon noise only, cal-sci contamination only, sci-sci contamination only, and all effects combined. For the preliminary design of CHORUS, we estimated that the cal-sci contamination fraction is smaller than 0.0001% in flux across the whole CCD for either arm, resulting in a negligible impact on the RV precision. Assuming worst-case scenarios, we estimated the sci-sci contamination to be up to 0.1% in some traces, corresponding to an additional RV error of up to 10 cm/s. We demonstrate the importance of considering fiber-trace spacing and cross contamination in PRV spectrographs, and we recommend careful design, operation, and spectral extraction algorithms to minimize and mitigate cross contamination to achieve the best possible instrumental RV precision.</description>

      <title>DRAGyS -- A comprehensive tool to extract scattering phase functions in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stages of planet formation, involving dust grain growth and planetesimals formation, remain shrouded in mystery. The analysis of the Scattering Phase Function (SPF) measured in disks surrounding young stars holds great potential for revealing crucial information about dust grain properties. Given the increasing number of high-quality datasets available, an efficient method to extract the SPF is required. DRAGyS is a tool designed for the quick and comprehensive analysis of ring-shaped protoplanetary disks. It directly estimates the disk geometry and extracts the total and polarized SPF from scattered light images, without requiring any radiative transfer modeling, a limitation of previous efforts. Key disk parameters (inclination, position angle, aspect ratio) are obtained by fitting ellipses to the disk intensity peaks from the ring surface, assuming the disks are circular. We validated the method using simulated disk images and then applied it to archival polarized-intensity images of nine images for six protoplanetary disks. DRAGyS provides a method to correct for the effect of limb brightening on the SPF. DRAGyS recovers well the injected geometry and the SPF from synthetic images where the parameters are known. When compared to previously published results extracted from images without considering limb brightening, DRAGyS yields similar results for the inclination, position angle, and SPF. We show that the effect of limb brightening on the SPF is significant, with consequences for the inference of dust properties. DRAGyS takes advantage of a fast and purely geometrical approach to estimate ringed-disk geometries. It allows the efficient extraction of SPF either globally or by sectors, allowing it to deal with disk asymmetries. By bypassing the need for a full modeling of the disk geometry before SPF extraction, DRAGyS is well suited to study large samples of disk images.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb: A Sub-Neptune Beyond the Snow Line of an M-dwarf Confirmed by Keck AO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of high resolution follow-up observations of OGLE-2016-BLG-1195 using Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics with Keck, seven years after the event's peak. We resolve the lens, measuring its flux and the relative source-lens proper motion, thus finding the system to be a $M_{\rm p} = 10.08\pm 1.18\ M_{\rm \oplus}$ planet orbiting an M-dwarf, $M_{\rm L} = 0.62\pm 0.05\ M_{\odot}$, beyond the snow line, with a projected separation of $r_\perp=2.24\pm 0.21$ AU at $D_{\rm L} = 7.45\pm 0.55$ kpc. Our results are consistent with the discovery paper, which reports values with 1-sigma uncertainties based on a single mass-distance constraint from finite source effects. However, both the discovery paper and our follow-up results disagree with the analysis of a different group that also present the planetary signal detection. The latter utilizes \textit{Spitzer} photometry to measure a parallax signal claiming the system is an Earth-mass planet orbiting an ultracool dwarf. Their parallax signal though is improbable since it suggests a lens star in the disk moving perpendicular to Galactic rotation. Moreover, microlensing parallaxes can be impacted by systematic errors in the photometry. Therefore, we reanalyze the \textit{Spitzer} photometry using a Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) model to detrend detector systematics. We find that we can not confidently recover the same detrended light curve that is likely dominated by systematic errors in the photometric data. The results of this paper act as a cautionary tale that a careful understanding of detector systematics and how they influence astrophysical constraints is crucial.</description>

      <title>The Source of Hydrogen in Earth's Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being pivotal to the habitability of our planet, the process by which Earth gained its present-day hydrogen budget is unclear. Due to their isotopic similarity to terrestrial rocks across a range of elements, the meteorite group that is thought to best represent Earth's building blocks is the enstatite chondrites (ECs). Because of ECs' nominally anhydrous mineralogy, these building blocks have long been presumed to have supplied negligible hydrogen to the proto-Earth. However, recent bulk compositional measurements suggest that ECs may unexpectedly contain enough hydrogen to readily explain Earth's present-day water abundance. Together, these contradictory findings mean the contribution of ECs to Earth's hydrogen budget is currently unclear. As such, it is uncertain whether appreciable hydrogen is a systematic outcome of Earth's formation. Here, we explore the amount of hydrogen in ECs as well as the phase that may carry this element using sulfur X-ray absorption near edge structure (S-XANES) spectroscopy. We find that hydrogen bonded to sulfur is prevalent throughout the meteorite, with fine matrix containing on average almost 10 times more H-S than chondrule mesostasis. Moreover, the concentration of the H-S bond is linked to the abundance of micrometre-scale pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS, 0&lt;x&lt;0.125). This sulfide can sacrificially catalyse a reaction with H2 from the disk at high temperatures to create H2S, which could be dissolved in adjoining molten silicate-rich material. Upon rapid cooling, this assemblage would form pyrrhotite encased in submicron silicate-rich glass that carries trapped H2S. These findings indicate that hydrogen is present in ECs in higher concentrations than previously considered and could suggest that this element may have a systematic, rather than stochastic, origin on our planet.</description>

      <title>Forming Earth-like and Low-Mass Rocky Exoplanets Through Pebble and Planetesimal Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of planet formation through pebble accretion (PA) has gained in popularity over the past decade. Most PA studies start with planetary embryos much larger than those expected from the streaming instability. In this study, we analyse the formation of terrestrial planets around stars with masses ranging from 0.09 to 1.00 M$_\odot$ through pebble accretion, starting from small planetesimals with radii between 175 and 450 km. We performed numerical simulations using a modified version of the N-body simulator SyMBA, which includes pebble accretion, type I and II migration, and eccentricity and inclination damping. Two different prescriptions for the PA rate were analysed. We find that Earth-like planets are consistently formed around 0.49, 0.70, and 1.00 M$_\odot$ stars, irrespective of the pebble accretion model that is used. However, Earth-like planets seldom remain in the habitable zone, for they rapidly migrate to the inner edge of the disc. Furthermore, we find that pebble accretion onto small planetesimals cannot produce Earth-mass planets around 0.09 and 0.20 M$_\odot$ stars, challenging the proposed narrative of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Although our models can explain the formation of Earth-mass planets around Sun-like stars, we find a low likelihood of Earth-like planets remaining in the habitable zone. Further research is needed to determine if models with a lower pebble mass flux or with additional migration traps could produce more Solar System-like planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Leaky Dust Traps in Planet-Embedded Protoplanetary Disks</title>

Abstract: From the survival of dust disks for a few Myr to the establishment of chemical dichotomy, dust traps are expected to play a pivotal role in sculpting protoplanetary disks and the early planet formation process. These traps however may not be perfect as evidenced by the detection of gas and dust inside the gaps and cavities of structured disks. Using two-fluid hydrodynamic global simulations in both two-dimensions (2D) and three-dimensions (3D), we directly compute the dynamics of dust grains as they aerodynamically interact with the disk gas that is being perturbed by an embedded planet of varying mass. In both 2D and 3D, we find the dust trap to be more leaky for lower mass planet and for higher turbulent $\alpha$. More crucially, we find the fraction of the dust mass that remain trapped within the pressure bump can be up to an order of magnitude more reduced in 3D vs. 2D with all else equal. Our simulations show a complex behavior of dust radial motion that is both azimuthally and poloidally non-uniform, with the overall dynamics dominated by the dust coupling to the gas flow even for relatively high St = 0.1. The leaky traps we find suggest pebble isolation mass is likely not truly isolating and that gap-opening planets do not establish as an unconditional impermeable barrier. Our findings have implications for recent JWST MINDS results, which show that volatiles, including water, are present in the inner regions of disks hosting outer dust rings.</description>

      <title>Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10715</link>

Abstract: Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90% to 44%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.</description>

      <title>Milestones at the Origin of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and molecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they have homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and genetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions underlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human beings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of spontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a very long time. The evolution contains, however some "landmarks" and bottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the article tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates that a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in prebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The homochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which causes aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are established through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\approx$ 4 Gyr ago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs environment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (S)pins the Planet</title>

Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>
