      <title>QueryExplorer: An Interactive Query Generation Assistant for Search and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating effective search queries remains a challenging task, particularly when users lack expertise in a specific domain or are not proficient in the language of the content. Providing example documents of interest might be easier for a user. However, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and the retrieval effectiveness is highly sensitive to the query generation method, without a clear way to incorporate user feedback. To enable exploration and to support Human-In-The-Loop experiments we propose QueryExplorer -- an interactive query generation, reformulation, and retrieval interface with support for HuggingFace generation models and PyTerrier's retrieval pipelines and datasets, and extensive logging of human feedback. To allow users to create and modify effective queries, our demo supports complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting the user with edits and feedback at multiple stages of the query formulation process. With support for recording fine-grained interactions and user annotations, QueryExplorer can serve as a valuable experimental and research platform for annotation, qualitative evaluation, and conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries.</description>

      <title>User-Side Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users are dissatisfied with services. Since the service is not tailor-made for a user, it is natural for dissatisfaction to arise. The problem is, that even if users are dissatisfied, they often do not have the means to resolve their dissatisfaction. The user cannot alter the source code of the service, nor can they force the service provider to change. The user has no choice but to remain dissatisfied or quit the service. User-side realization offers proactive solutions to this problem by providing general algorithms to deal with common problems on the user's side. These algorithms run on the user's side and solve the problems without having the service provider change the service itself.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-aware Dual-side Attribute-enhanced Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{Knowledge-aware} recommendation methods (KGR) based on \textit{graph neural networks} (GNNs) and \textit{contrastive learning} (CL) have achieved promising performance. However, they fall short in modeling fine-grained user preferences and further fail to leverage the \textit{preference-attribute connection} to make predictions, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address the issue, we propose a method named \textit{\textbf{K}nowledge-aware \textbf{D}ual-side \textbf{A}ttribute-enhanced \textbf{R}ecommendation} (KDAR). Specifically, we build \textit{user preference representations} and \textit{attribute fusion representations} upon the attribute information in knowledge graphs, which are utilized to enhance \textit{collaborative filtering} (CF) based user and item representations, respectively. To discriminate the contribution of each attribute in these two types of attribute-based representations, a \textit{multi-level collaborative alignment contrasting} mechanism is proposed to align the importance of attributes with CF signals. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of KDAR over several state-of-the-art baselines. Further analyses verify the effectiveness of our method. The code of KDAR is released at: \href{https://github.com/TJTP/KDAR}{https://github.com/TJTP/KDAR}.</description>

      <title>RankingSHAP -- Listwise Feature Attribution Explanations for Ranking Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature attributions are a commonly used explanation type, when we want to posthoc explain the prediction of a trained model. Yet, they are not very well explored in IR. Importantly, feature attribution has rarely been rigorously defined, beyond attributing the most important feature the highest value. What it means for a feature to be more important than others is often left vague. Consequently, most approaches focus on just selecting the most important features and under utilize or even ignore the relative importance within features. In this work, we rigorously define the notion of feature attribution for ranking models, and list essential properties that a valid attribution should have. We then propose RankingSHAP as a concrete instantiation of a list-wise ranking attribution method. Contrary to current explanation evaluation schemes that focus on selections, we propose two novel evaluation paradigms for evaluating attributions over learning-to-rank models. We evaluate RankingSHAP for commonly used learning-to-rank datasets to showcase the more nuanced use of an attribution method while highlighting the limitations of selection-based explanations. In a simulated experiment we design an interpretable model to demonstrate how list-wise ranking attributes can be used to investigate model decisions and evaluate the explanations qualitatively. Because of the contrastive nature of the ranking task, our understanding of ranking model decisions can substantially benefit from feature attribution explanations like RankingSHAP.</description>

      <title>Complementary Recommendation in E-commerce: Definition, Approaches, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, complementary recommendation has received extensive attention in the e-commerce domain. In this paper, we comprehensively summarize and compare 34 representative studies conducted between 2009 and 2024. Firstly, we compare the data and methods used for modeling complementary relationships between products, including simple complementarity and more complex scenarios such as asymmetric complementarity, the coexistence of substitution and complementarity relationships between products, and varying degrees of complementarity between different pairs of products. Next, we classify and compare the models based on the research problems of complementary recommendation, such as diversity, personalization, and cold-start. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of experimental results from different studies conducted on the same dataset, which helps identify the strengths and weaknesses of the research. Compared to previous surveys, this paper provides a more updated and comprehensive summary of the research, discusses future research directions, and contributes to the advancement of this field.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Selective State Space Model's Capabilities in Lifelong Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommenders have been widely applied in various online services, aiming to model users' dynamic interests from their sequential interactions. With users increasingly engaging with online platforms, vast amounts of lifelong user behavioral sequences have been generated. However, existing sequential recommender models often struggle to handle such lifelong sequences. The primary challenges stem from computational complexity and the ability to capture long-range dependencies within the sequence. Recently, a state space model featuring a selective mechanism (i.e., Mamba) has emerged. In this work, we investigate the performance of Mamba for lifelong sequential recommendation (i.e., length&gt;=2k). More specifically, we leverage the Mamba block to model lifelong user sequences selectively. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of representative sequential recommendation models in the setting of lifelong sequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Mamba. We found that RecMamba achieves performance comparable to the representative model while significantly reducing training duration by approximately 70% and memory costs by 80%. Codes and data are available at \url{https://github.com/nancheng58/RecMamba}.</description>

      <title>Play to Your Strengths: Collaborative Intelligence of Conventional Recommender Models and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in Recommender Systems (RSs) by enhancing user behavior modeling and content understanding. However, current approaches that integrate LLMs into RSs solely utilize either LLM or conventional recommender model (CRM) to generate final recommendations, without considering which data segments LLM or CRM excel in. To fill in this gap, we conduct experiments on MovieLens-1M and Amazon-Books datasets, and compare the performance of a representative CRM (DCNv2) and an LLM (LLaMA2-7B) on various groups of data samples. Our findings reveal that LLMs excel in data segments where CRMs exhibit lower confidence and precision, while samples where CRM excels are relatively challenging for LLM, requiring substantial training data and a long training time for comparable performance. This suggests potential synergies in the combination between LLM and CRM. Motivated by these insights, we propose Collaborative Recommendation with conventional Recommender and Large Language Model (dubbed \textit{CoReLLa}). In this framework, we first jointly train LLM and CRM and address the issue of decision boundary shifts through alignment loss. Then, the resource-efficient CRM, with a shorter inference time, handles simple and moderate samples, while LLM processes the small subset of challenging samples for CRM. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoReLLa outperforms state-of-the-art CRM and LLM methods significantly, underscoring its effectiveness in recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>GloSIS: The Global Soil Information System Web Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Established in 2012 by members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) is a global network of stakeholders promoting sound land and soil management practices towards a sustainable world food system. However, soil survey largely remains a local or regional activity, bound to heterogeneous methods and conventions. Recognising the relevance of global and trans-national policies towards sustainable land management practices, the GSP elected data harmonisation and exchange as one of its key lines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work towards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually developed within the GSP [54], the basis for a Global Soil Information System (GloSIS). This work also identified the Semantic Web as a possible avenue to operationalise the domain model. This article presents the GloSIS web ontology, an implementation of the GloSIS domain model with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Thoroughly employing a host of Semantic Web standards (SOSA, SKOS, GeoSPARQL, QUDT), GloSIS lays out not only a soil data ontology but also an extensive set of ready-to-use code-lists for soil description and physio-chemical analysis. Various examples are provided on the provision and use of GloSIS-compliant linked data, showcasing the contribution of this ontology to the discovery, exploration, integration and access of soil data.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Tuning for Ad-hoc Document Retrieval Using Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning in information retrieval systems using pre-trained language models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning. This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation and query-document relations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Recommender Systems with Large Language Models for State Reward and Action Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based recommender systems have demonstrated promising performance in meeting user expectations by learning to make accurate next-item recommendations from historical user-item interactions. However, existing offline RL-based sequential recommendation methods face the challenge of obtaining effective user feedback from the environment. Effectively modeling the user state and shaping an appropriate reward for recommendation remains a challenge. In this paper, we leverage language understanding capabilities and adapt large language models (LLMs) as an environment (LE) to enhance RL-based recommenders. The LE is learned from a subset of user-item interaction data, thus reducing the need for large training data, and can synthesise user feedback for offline data by: (i) acting as a state model that produces high quality states that enrich the user representation, and (ii) functioning as a reward model to accurately capture nuanced user preferences on actions. Moreover, the LE allows to generate positive actions that augment the limited offline training data. We propose a LE Augmentation (LEA) method to further improve recommendation performance by optimising jointly the supervised component and the RL policy, using the augmented actions and historical user signals. We use LEA, the state and reward models in conjunction with state-of-the-art RL recommenders and report experimental results on two publicly available datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Loops On Retrieval Augmented Generation (LoRAG), a new framework designed to enhance the quality of retrieval-augmented text generation through the incorporation of an iterative loop mechanism. The architecture integrates a generative model, a retrieval mechanism, and a dynamic loop module, allowing for iterative refinement of the generated text through interactions with relevant information retrieved from the input context. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoRAG surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU score, ROUGE score, and perplexity, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving both coherence and relevance in generated text. The qualitative assessment further illustrates LoRAG's capability to produce contextually rich and coherent outputs. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of iterative loops in mitigating challenges in text generation, positioning LoRAG as a promising advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>GTC: GNN-Transformer Co-contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the most powerful weapon for various graph tasks due to the message-passing mechanism's great local information aggregation ability. However, over-smoothing has always hindered GNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs, Transformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via multi-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more immunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, can we propose a novel framework to combine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information aggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate the over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a collaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC architecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node information from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive learning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize self-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch, we propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with GNN to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As far as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation learning to utilize both GNN and Transformer to collaboratively capture different view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning. The experiments on real datasets show that GTC exhibits superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Codes can be available at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/GTC.</description>

      <title>Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional Phase Retrieval with Biased Spatial Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a spectral initialization method that plays a central role in contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models share the same threshold value.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Like Machine Comprehension: Few-Shot Relational Learning in Visually-Rich Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key-value relations are prevalent in Visually-Rich Documents (VRDs), often depicted in distinct spatial regions accompanied by specific color and font styles. These non-textual cues serve as important indicators that greatly enhance human comprehension and acquisition of such relation triplets. However, current document AI approaches often fail to consider this valuable prior information related to visual and spatial features, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly when dealing with limited examples. To address this limitation, our research focuses on few-shot relational learning, specifically targeting the extraction of key-value relation triplets in VRDs. Given the absence of a suitable dataset for this task, we introduce two new few-shot benchmarks built upon existing supervised benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose a variational approach that incorporates relational 2D-spatial priors and prototypical rectification techniques. This approach aims to generate relation representations that are more aware of the spatial context and unseen relation in a manner similar to human perception. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by showcasing its ability to outperform existing methods. This study also opens up new possibilities for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Model, Analyze, and Comprehend User Interactions and Various Attributes within a Social Media Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively model, analyze, and comprehend user interactions and various attributes within a social media platform based on post-comment relationship? In this study, we propose a novel graph-based approach to model and analyze user interactions within a social media platform based on post-comment relationship. We construct a user interaction graph from social media data and analyze it to gain insights into community dynamics, user behavior, and content preferences. Our investigation reveals that while 56.05% of the active users are strongly connected within the community, only 0.8% of them significantly contribute to its dynamics. Moreover, we observe temporal variations in community activity, with certain periods experiencing heightened engagement. Additionally, our findings highlight a correlation between user activity and popularity showing that more active users are generally more popular. Alongside these, a preference for positive and informative content is also observed where 82.41% users preferred positive and informative content. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing online communities, leveraging graph-based techniques to gain valuable insights into user behavior and community dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low-Cost Two-Stage Multimodal System for Non-Normative Behavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The online community has increasingly been inundated by a toxic wave of harmful comments. In response to this growing challenge, we introduce a two-stage ultra-low-cost multimodal harmful behavior detection method designed to identify harmful comments and images with high precision and recall rates. We first utilize the CLIP-ViT model to transform tweets and images into embeddings, effectively capturing the intricate interplay of semantic meaning and subtle contextual clues within texts and images. Then in the second stage, the system feeds these embeddings into a conventional machine learning classifier like SVM or logistic regression, enabling the system to be trained rapidly and to perform inference at an ultra-low cost. By converting tweets into rich multimodal embeddings through the CLIP-ViT model and utilizing them to train conventional machine learning classifiers, our system is not only capable of detecting harmful textual information with near-perfect performance, achieving precision and recall rates above 99\% but also demonstrates the ability to zero-shot harmful images without additional training, thanks to its multimodal embedding input. This capability empowers our system to identify unseen harmful images without requiring extensive and costly image datasets. Additionally, our system quickly adapts to new harmful content; if a new harmful content pattern is identified, we can fine-tune the classifier with the corresponding tweets' embeddings to promptly update the system. This makes it well suited to addressing the ever-evolving nature of online harmfulness, providing online communities with a robust, generalizable, and cost-effective tool to safeguard their communities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Facet Generation with LLM Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information retrieval, facet identification of a user query is an important task. If a search service can recognize the facets of a user's query, it has the potential to offer users a much broader range of search results. Previous studies can enhance facet prediction by leveraging retrieved documents and related queries obtained through a search engine. However, there are challenges in extending it to other applications when a search engine operates as part of the model. First, search engines are constantly updated. Therefore, additional information may change during training and test, which may reduce performance. The second challenge is that public search engines cannot search for internal documents. Therefore, a separate search system needs to be built to incorporate documents from private domains within the company. We propose two strategies that focus on a framework that can predict facets by taking only queries as input without a search engine. The first strategy is multi-task learning to predict SERP. By leveraging SERP as a target instead of a source, the proposed model deeply understands queries without relying on external modules. The second strategy is to enhance the facets by combining Large Language Model (LLM) and the small model. Overall performance improves when small model and LLM are combined rather than facet generation individually.</description>

      <title>An Experiment with the Use of ChatGPT for LCSH Subject Assignment on Electronic Theses and Dissertations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the potential use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). The authors employed ChatGPT to generate subject headings for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) based on their titles and summaries. The results revealed that although some generated subject headings were valid, there were issues regarding specificity and exhaustiveness. The study showcases that LLMs can serve as a strategic response to the backlog of items awaiting cataloging in academic libraries, while also offering a cost-effective approach for promptly generating LCSH. Nonetheless, human catalogers remain essential for verifying and enhancing the validity, exhaustiveness, and specificity of LCSH generated by LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces InstUPR, an unsupervised passage reranking method based on large language models (LLMs). Different from existing approaches that rely on extensive training with query-document pairs or retrieval-specific instructions, our method leverages the instruction-following capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs for passage reranking without any additional fine-tuning. To achieve this, we introduce a soft score aggregation technique and employ pairwise reranking for unsupervised passage reranking. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that InstUPR outperforms unsupervised baselines as well as an instruction-tuned reranker, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Source code to reproduce all experiments is open-sourced at https://github.com/MiuLab/InstUPR</description>

      <title>LARA: Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Multi-Turn Intent Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the significant achievements of large language models (LLMs), researchers have employed in-context learning for text classification tasks. However, these studies focused on monolingual, single-turn classification tasks. In this paper, we introduce LARA (Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Language Models), designed to enhance accuracy in multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating numerous intents in chatbot interactions. Multi-turn intent classification is notably challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational contexts. LARA tackles these issues by combining a fine-tuned smaller model with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of LLMs. This integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context. Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tune. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67% compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of embedding models for patent similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes two contributions to the field of text-based patent similarity. First, it compares the performance of different kinds of patent-specific pretrained embedding models, namely static word embeddings (such as word2vec and doc2vec models) and contextual word embeddings (such as transformers based models), on the task of patent similarity calculation. Second, it compares specifically the performance of Sentence Transformers (SBERT) architectures with different training phases on the patent similarity task. To assess the models' performance, we use information about patent interferences, a phenomenon in which two or more patent claims belonging to different patent applications are proven to be overlapping by patent examiners. Therefore, we use these interferences cases as a proxy for maximum similarity between two patents, treating them as ground-truth to evaluate the performance of the different embedding models. Our results point out that, first, Patent SBERT-adapt-ub, the domain adaptation of the pretrained Sentence Transformer architecture proposed in this research, outperforms the current state-of-the-art in patent similarity. Second, they show that, in some cases, large static models performances are still comparable to contextual ones when trained on extensive data; thus, we believe that the superiority in the performance of contextual embeddings may not be related to the actual architecture but rather to the way the training phase is performed.</description>

      <title>Graph Augmentation for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph augmentation with contrastive learning has gained significant attention in the field of recommendation systems due to its ability to learn expressive user representations, even when labeled data is limited. However, directly applying existing GCL models to real-world recommendation environments poses challenges. There are two primary issues to address. Firstly, the lack of consideration for data noise in contrastive learning can result in noisy self-supervised signals, leading to degraded performance. Secondly, many existing GCL approaches rely on graph neural network (GNN) architectures, which can suffer from over-smoothing problems due to non-adaptive message passing. To address these challenges, we propose a principled framework called GraphAug. This framework introduces a robust data augmentor that generates denoised self-supervised signals, enhancing recommender systems. The GraphAug framework incorporates a graph information bottleneck (GIB)-regularized augmentation paradigm, which automatically distills informative self-supervision information and adaptively adjusts contrastive view generation. Through rigorous experimentation on real-world datasets, we thoroughly assessed the performance of our novel GraphAug model. The outcomes consistently unveil its superiority over existing baseline methods. The source code for our model is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphAug.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-based code question answering seeks to match user queries in natural language to relevant code snippets. Previous approaches typically rely on pretraining models using crafted bi-modal and uni-modal datasets to align text and code representations. In this paper, we introduce ProCQA, a large-scale programming question answering dataset extracted from the StackOverflow community, offering naturally structured mixed-modal QA pairs. To validate its effectiveness, we propose a modality-agnostic contrastive pre-training approach to improve the alignment of text and code representations of current code language models. Compared to previous models that primarily employ bimodal and unimodal pairs extracted from CodeSearchNet for pre-training, our model exhibits significant performance improvements across a wide range of code retrieval benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: We present Spacerini, a tool that integrates the Pyserini toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with Hugging Face to enable the seamless construction and deployment of interactive search engines. Spacerini makes state-of-the-art sparse and dense retrieval models more accessible to non-IR practitioners while minimizing deployment effort. This is useful for NLP researchers who want to better understand and validate their research by performing qualitative analyses of training corpora, for IR researchers who want to demonstrate new retrieval models integrated into the growing Pyserini ecosystem, and for third parties reproducing the work of other researchers. Spacerini is open source and includes utilities for loading, preprocessing, indexing, and deploying search engines locally and remotely. We demonstrate a portfolio of 13 search engines created with Spacerini for different use cases.</description>

      <title>GNNUERS: Fairness Explanation in GNNs for Recommendation via Counterfactual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, research into personalization has been focusing on explainability and fairness. Several approaches proposed in recent works are able to explain individual recommendations in a post-hoc manner or by explanation paths. However, explainability techniques applied to unfairness in recommendation have been limited to finding user/item features mostly related to biased recommendations. In this paper, we devised a novel algorithm that leverages counterfactuality methods to discover user unfairness explanations in the form of user-item interactions. In our counterfactual framework, interactions are represented as edges in a bipartite graph, with users and items as nodes. Our bipartite graph explainer perturbs the topological structure to find an altered version that minimizes the disparity in utility between the protected and unprotected demographic groups. Experiments on four real-world graphs coming from various domains showed that our method can systematically explain user unfairness on three state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models. Moreover, an empirical evaluation of the perturbed network uncovered relevant patterns that justify the nature of the unfairness discovered by the generated explanations. The source code and the preprocessed data sets are available at https://github.com/jackmedda/RS-BGExplainer.</description>

      <title>On the resilience of Collaborative Learning-based Recommender Systems Against Community Detection Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems emerged following the success of collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL) and Gossip Learning (GL). In these systems, users participate in the training of a recommender system while maintaining their history of consumed items on their devices. While these solutions seemed appealing for preserving the privacy of the participants at first glance, recent studies have revealed that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this paper, we study the resilience of collaborative learning-based recommender systems against a novel privacy attack called Community Detection Attack (CDA). This attack enables an adversary to identify community members based on a chosen set of items (eg., identifying users interested in specific points-of-interest). Through experiments on three real recommendation datasets using two state-of-the-art recommendation models, we evaluate the sensitivity of an FL-based recommender system as well as two flavors of Gossip Learning-based recommender systems to CDA. The results show that across all models and datasets, the FL setting is more vulnerable to CDA compared to Gossip settings. Furthermore, we assess two off-the-shelf mitigation strategies, namely differential privacy (DP) and a \emph{Share less} policy, which consists of sharing a subset of less sensitive model parameters. The findings indicate a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off for the \emph{Share less} strategy, particularly in FedRecs.</description>

      <title>Our Model Achieves Excellent Performance on MovieLens: What Does it Mean?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical benchmark dataset for recommender system (RecSys) evaluation consists of user-item interactions generated on a platform within a time period. The interaction generation mechanism partially explains why a user interacts with (e.g., like, purchase, rate) an item, and the context of when a particular interaction happened. In this study, we conduct a meticulous analysis of the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact of using the dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal recommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive interaction process. We further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction generation mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of typical real-world recommendation scenarios. In summary, the MovieLens platform demonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to address cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation accuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in practice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the contexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user knowledge about the item collections. While results on MovieLens can be useful as a reference, they should not be solely relied upon as the primary justification for the effectiveness of a recommendation system model.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Generative Recommendation: A Survey and Visionary Discussions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) not only have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to reshape many other fields, e.g., recommender systems (RS). However, most of the related work treats an LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g., as a feature extractor), which may not be able to fully leverage the generative power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple stages, such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods, and future directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions: 1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for various RS tasks. We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance needed to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</description>

      <title>NoteLLM: A Retrievable Large Language Model for Note Recommendation</title>

Abstract: People enjoy sharing "notes" including their experiences within online communities. Therefore, recommending notes aligned with user interests has become a crucial task. Existing online methods only input notes into BERT-based models to generate note embeddings for assessing similarity. However, they may underutilize some important cues, e.g., hashtags or categories, which represent the key concepts of notes. Indeed, learning to generate hashtags/categories can potentially enhance note embeddings, both of which compress key note information into limited content. Besides, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly outperformed BERT in understanding natural languages. It is promising to introduce LLMs into note recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework called NoteLLM, which leverages LLMs to address the item-to-item (I2I) note recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Note Compression Prompt to compress a note into a single special token, and further learn the potentially related notes' embeddings via a contrastive learning approach. Moreover, we use NoteLLM to summarize the note and generate the hashtag/category automatically through instruction tuning. Extensive validations on real scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the online baseline and show major improvements in the recommendation system of Xiaohongshu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%. The code and ITCPR dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/Word4Per.</description>

      <title>In-context Learning with Retrieved Demonstrations for Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11624v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models, especially pre-trained large language models, have showcased remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward, leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training procedures, and inference algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of machine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries. However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should not be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda, a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort are saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization can be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods consistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those by the baselines.</description>
