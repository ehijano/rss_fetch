      <title>The behavior of higher proof theory I: Case $\Sigma^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current ordinal analysis provides the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory, which calibrates the robustness of the $\Pi^1_1$-consequences of the theory. We can ask whether there is an ordinal characteristic capturing more complex consequences, and it turns out that we can define the $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal capturing the robustness of the $\Sigma^1_2$-consequences of a theory. In this paper, we study the behavior of $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal, and it turns out that $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal also follows an analogue of Walsh's characterization of proof-theoretic ordinal.</description>

      <title>On the downward L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem for elementary submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new definition of a model for a formal mathematical system. The definition is based upon the substitution in the formal systems, which allows a purely algebraic approach to model theory. This is very suitable for applications due to a general syntax used in the formal systems. For our models we present a new proof of the downward L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem for elementary submodels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all \( d \geq 3 \) we show that the cardinality of \( \mathbb{R} \) is at most \( \aleph_n \) if and only if \( \R^d \) can be covered with \( ( n + 1 ) ( d - 1 ) + 1 \) sprays whose centers are in general position in a hyperplane. This extends previous results by Schmerl when \( d = 2 \).</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Foundations for conditional probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.03753v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result presented in this article is that probability can fundamentally be characterized as a subset of conditional expectation induced by a plausible preorder on random quantities. This is justified by the fact that probability is coherent as confirmed by its common formalizations, and by our result that a function is coherent if and only if it is a subset of conditional expectation induced by a plausible preorder on random quantities.
  In addition to offering a different perspective on conditional probability, our use of a plausible preorder in the role of a fundamental notion extends conditional probability to cases in which the calculation of conditional probability using the P(A|C)=\frac{P(A\wedge C)}{P(C)} rule fails: if P is a coherent function, then it can be extended so that for every event A and nonzero event C holds that P(A|C)=0 if A\wedge C=0 and P(A|C)=1 if A\wedge C=C, no matter whether the unconditional probability P(C) is zero or whether it is defined.</description>

      <title>Copies of Monomorphic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The poset of copies of a relational structure ${\mathbb X}$ is the partial order $\langle {\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X}) ,\subset \rangle$, where ${\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X})=\{ Y\subset X: {\mathbb Y} \cong {\mathbb X}\}$. Investigating the classification of structures related to isomorphism of the Boolean completions ${\mathbb B}_{\mathbb X} ={\mathop{\rm ro}\nolimits}({\mathop{\rm sq}\nolimits} ({\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X}) ))$ we extend the results concerning linear orders to the class of structures definable in linear orders by first-order $\Sigma _0$-formulas (monomorphic structures). So, ${\mathbb B}_{\mathbb X} \cong {\mathbb B}_{\mathbb L}$ holds for some linear order ${\mathbb L}$, if ${\mathbb X}$ is definable in a $\sigma$-scattered (in particular, countable) or additively indecomposable linear order. For example, ${\mathbb B}_{\mathbb X} \cong {\mathop{\rm ro}\nolimits}({\mathbb S} )$, where ${\mathbb S}$ is the Sacks forcing, whenever ${\mathbb X}$ is a non-constant structure chainable by a real order type containing a perfect set.</description>

      <title>Computable analysis on the space of marked groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01179v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate decision problems for finitely generated groups described by word problem algorithms. This is equivalent to studying groups described by computable labelled Cayley graphs. We relate these problems to the study of computable analysis on the space of marked groups, and point out several results of computable analysis that can be directly applied to obtain group theoretical results. Those results, used in conjunction with the version of Higman's Embedding Theorem that preserves solvability of the word problem, provide powerful tools to build finitely presented groups with solvable word problem but with various undecidable properties. Interestingly, the only results of computable analysis that can be applied together with Higman's Embedding Theorem are those of what is known as ``Markov's school of computable analysis''. We thus focus on articles which predate most of what is seen as the modern corpus of research in computable analysis. The presented results show that these older results are still very relevant. We also place group properties in the first levels of the arithmetical hierarchy for decision problems about groups given by word problem algorithms, and show that on many group properties usually considered, this effective hierarchy corresponds sharply to the Borel hierarchy. Finally, we prove that the space of marked groups is a Polish space that is not \emph{effectively Polish}. Because of this, many of the most important results of Markovian computable analysis cannot be applied to the space of marked groups. This includes the Kreisel-Lacombe-Schoenfield-Ceitin Theorem and a theorem of Moschovakis. The space of marked groups constitutes the first natural example of a Polish space that is not effectively Polish.</description>

      <title>Nested Sequents for Intermediate Logics: The Case of G\"odel-Dummett Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present nested sequent systems for propositional G\"odel-Dummett logic and its first-order extensions with non-constant and constant domains, built atop nested calculi for intuitionistic logics. To obtain nested systems for these G\"odel-Dummett logics, we introduce a new structural rule, called the "linearity rule," which (bottom-up) operates by linearizing branching structure in a given nested sequent. In addition, an interesting feature of our calculi is the inclusion of reachability rules, which are special logical rules that operate by propagating data and/or checking if data exists along certain paths within a nested sequent. Such rules require us to generalize our nested sequents to include signatures (i.e. finite collections of variables) in the first-order cases, thus giving rise to a generalization of the usual nested sequent formalism. Our calculi exhibit favorable properties, admitting the height-preserving invertibility of every logical rule and the (height-preserving) admissibility of a large collection of structural and reachability rules. We prove all of our systems sound and cut-free complete, and show that syntactic cut-elimination obtains for the intuitionistic systems. We conclude the paper by discussing possible extensions and modifications, putting forth an array of structural rules that could be used to provide a sizable class of intermediate logics with cut-free nested sequent systems.</description>

      <title>Varieties of MV-monoids and positive MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MV-monoids are algebras $\langle A,\vee,\wedge, \oplus,\odot, 0,1\rangle$ where $\langle A, \vee, \wedge, 0, 1\rangle$ is a bounded distributive lattice, both $\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle$ and $\langle A, \odot, 1\rangle$ are commutative monoids, and some further connecting axioms are satisfied. Every MV-algebra in the signature $\{\oplus,\neg,0\}$ is term equivalent to an algebra that has an MV-monoid as a reduct, by defining, as standard, $1:= \neg 0$, $x \odot y := \neg(\neg x \oplus\neg y)$, $x \vee y := (x \odot \neg y) \oplus y$ and $x \wedge y := \neg(\neg x \vee \neg y)$. Particular examples of MV-monoids are positive MV-algebras, i.e. the $\{\vee, \wedge, \oplus, \odot, 0, 1\}$-subreducts of MV-algebras. Positive MV-algebras form a peculiar quasivariety in the sense that, albeit having a logical motivation (being the quasivariety of subreducts of MV-algebras), it is not the equivalent quasivariety semantics of any logic. In this paper, we study the lattices of subvarieties of MV-monoids and of positive MV-algebras. In particular, we characterize and axiomatize all almost minimal varieties of MV-monoids, we characterize the finite subdirectly irreducible positive MV-algebras, and we characterize and axiomatize all varieties of positive MV-algebras.</description>
