      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Locally isotropic Steinberg groups I. Centrality of the $\mathrm K_2$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin to study Steinberg groups associated with a locally isotropic reductive group $G$ over a arbitrary ring. We propose a construction of such a Steinberg group functor as a group object in a certain completion of the category of presheaves. We also show that it is a crossed module over $G$ in a unique way, in particular, that the $\mathrm K_2$-functor is central. If $G$ is globally isotropic in a suitable sense, then the Steinberg group functor exists as an ordinary group-valued functor and all such abstract Steinberg groups are crossed modules over the groups of points of $G$.</description>

      <title>Character theory and Euler characteristic for orbispaces and infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a discrete group $G$ with a finite model for $\underline{E}G$, we study $K(n)^*(BG)$ and $E^*(BG)$, where $K(n)$ is the $n$-th Morava $K$-theory for a given prime and $E$ is the height $n$ Morava $E$-theory. In particular we generalize the character theory of Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel who studied these objects for finite groups. We give a formula for a localization of $E^*(BG)$ and the $K(n)$-theoretic Euler characteristic of $BG$ in terms of centralizers. In certain cases these calculations lead to a full computation of $E^*(BG)$, for example when $G$ is a right angled Coxeter group, and for $G=SL_3(\mathbb{Z})$. We apply our results to the mapping class group $\Gamma_\frac{p-1}{2}$ for an odd prime $p$ and to certain arithmetic groups, including the symplectic group $Sp_{p-1}(\mathbb{Z})$ for an odd prime $p$ and $SL_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$ for a totally real field $K$.</description>

      <title>A character approach to the ISR property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a character approach to study the invariant von Neumann subalgebras rigidity property (abbreviated as the ISR property) introduced in Amrutam-Jiang's work. First, we introduce the non-factorizable regular character property for groups and show that this implies the ISR property for any infinite ICC groups with trivial amenable radical.Various examples are shown to have this property. Second, we apply known classification results on indecomposable characters to show approximately finite groups have the ISR property. Based on this approach, we also construct non-amenable groups with the ISR property while having non-trivial amenable radical or without the non-factorizable regular character property.</description>

      <title>Finitude g\'eom\'etrique en g\'eom\'etrie de Hilbert + an erratum/addendum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5442</link>
      <description>arXiv:1202.5442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is divided in 2 parts. The first part is the original paper of the second and third authors arXiv:1202.5442v2. The second part is an erratum/addendum written in english and concatenated at the end of the former paper. In the erratum/addentum, we amend Theorems 1.3 and 1.11 of arXiv:1202.5442v2: Finitude g\'eom\'etrique en g\'eom\'etrie de Hilbert. We seize the opportunity to show that in round Hilbert geometry, geometrical finiteness (gf) is equivalent to cusp-uniform action and to fill some small gaps that appear in two other proofs of arXiv:1202.5442v2.</description>

      <title>Zero-sum partitions of Abelian groups and their applications to magic- and antimagic-type labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09395v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}. $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic- and antimagic-type labelings of graphs.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity for representations via self-joinings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group $G_1$. We discuss a rigidity problem for discrete faithful representations $\rho:\Gamma\to G_2$ and a surprising role played by higher rank conformal measures of the associated self-joining group. Our approach recovers rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia and Yue, as well as applies to Anosov representations, including Hitchin representations. More precisely, for a given representation $\rho$ with a boundary map $f$ defined on the limit set $\Lambda$, we ask whether the extendability of $\rho$ to $G$ can be detected by the property that $f$ pushes forward some $\Gamma$-conformal measure class $[\nu_\Gamma]$ to a $\rho(\Gamma)$-conformal measure class $[\nu_{\rho(\Gamma)}]$. When $\Gamma$ is of divergence type in a rank one group or when $\rho$ arises from an Anosov representation, we give an affirmative answer by showing that if the self-joining $\Gamma_\rho=(\text{id} \times \rho)(\Gamma)$ is Zariski dense in $G_1\times G_2$, then the push-forward measures $(\text{id}\times f)_*\nu_\Gamma$ and $(f^{-1}\times \text{id})_*\nu_{\rho(\Gamma)}$, which are higher rank $\Gamma_\rho$-conformal measures, cannot be in the same measure class.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable involutive set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation of size $p^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. Their combinatorial counterpart are set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, whose investigation is strongly driven by the study of algebraic objects called (skew) braces. In this article, we focus on indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. More specifically, through a thorough analysis of their associated braces, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$, for $p$ a prime.</description>

      <title>A Lazard correspondence for post-Lie rings and skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lazard correspondence between post-Lie rings and skew braces that satisfy a natural completeness condition. This is done through a thorough study of how the Lazard correspondence behaves on semi-direct sums of Lie rings. In particular, for a prime $p$ and $k&lt;p$, we obtain a correspondence between skew braces of order $p^k$ and left nilpotent post-Lie rings of order $p^k$ on a nilpotent Lie ring. This therefore extends results by Smoktunowicz.</description>
