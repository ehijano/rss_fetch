      <title>Leak Proof CMap; a framework for training and evaluation of cell line agnostic L1000 similarity methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Connectivity Map (CMap) is a large publicly available database of cellular transcriptomic responses to chemical and genetic perturbations built using a standardized acquisition protocol known as the L1000 technique. Databases such as CMap provide an exciting opportunity to enrich drug discovery efforts, providing a 'known' phenotypic landscape to explore and enabling the development of state of the art techniques for enhanced information extraction and better informed decisions. Whilst multiple methods for measuring phenotypic similarity and interrogating profiles have been developed, the field is severely lacking standardized benchmarks using appropriate data splitting for training and unbiased evaluation of machine learning methods. To address this, we have developed 'Leak Proof CMap' and exemplified its application to a set of common transcriptomic and generic phenotypic similarity methods along with an exemplar triplet loss-based method. Benchmarking in three critical performance areas (compactness, distinctness, and uniqueness) is conducted using carefully crafted data splits ensuring no similar cell lines or treatments with shared or closely matching responses or mechanisms of action are present in training, validation, or test sets. This enables testing of models with unseen samples akin to exploring treatments with novel modes of action in novel patient derived cell lines. With a carefully crafted benchmark and data splitting regime in place, the tooling now exists to create performant phenotypic similarity methods for use in personalized medicine (novel cell lines) and to better augment high throughput phenotypic screening technologies with the L1000 transcriptomic technology.</description>

      <title>Noise propagation and MP-PCA image denoising for high-resolution quantitative T2* and magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is a technique for measuring magnetic susceptibility of tissues, aiding in the detection of pathologies like traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis by analyzing variations in substances such as iron and calcium. Despite its clinical value, achieving high-resolution QSM (voxel sizes &lt; 1 mm3) reduces signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compromising diagnostic quality. To mitigate this, we applied the Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA) denoising technique on T2* weighted data, to enhance the quality of R2*, T2*, and QSM maps. Denoising was tested on a numerical phantom, healthy subjects, and patients with brain metastases and sickle cell disease, demonstrating effective and robust improvements across different scan settings. Further analysis examined noise propagation in R2* and T2* values, revealing lower noise-related variations in R2* values compared to T2* values which tended to be overestimated due to noise. Reduced variability was observed in QSM values post denoising, demonstrating MP-PCA's potential to improve the</description>

      <title>High-precision chemical quantum sensing in flowing monodisperse microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel flow-based method for high-precision chemical detection that integrates quantum sensing with droplet microfluidics. We deploy nanodiamond particles hosting fluorescent nitrogen vacancy defects as quantum sensors in flowing, monodisperse, picoliter-volume microdroplets containing analyte molecules. ND motion within these microcompartments facilitates close sensor-analyte interaction and mitigates particle heterogeneity. Microdroplet flow rates are rapid (upto 4cm/s) and with minimal drift. Pairing this controlled flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, we introduce a new noise-suppressed mode of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance that is sensitive to chemical analytes while resilient against experimental variations, achieving detection of analyte-induced signals at an unprecedented level of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. We demonstrate its application to detecting paramagnetic ions in droplets with simultaneously low limit-of-detection and low analyte volumes, in a manner significantly better than existing technologies. This is combined with exceptional measurement stability over &gt;103s and across hundreds of thousands of droplets, while utilizing minimal sensor volumes and incurring low ND costs (&lt;$0.70 for an hour of operation). Additionally, we demonstrate using these droplets as micro-confinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with analytes, including single cells. This versatility suggests wide-ranging applications, like single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements in bioreactors. Our work paves the way for portable, high-sensitivity, amplification-free, chemical assays with high throughput; introduces a new chemical imaging tool for probing chemical reactions in microenvironments; and establishes the foundation for developing movable, arrayed quantum sensors through droplet microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Spatial information allows inference of the prevalence of direct cell-to-cell viral infection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of direct cell-to-cell spread in viral infections - where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment - has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation-estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell-to-cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non-spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell-to-cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection in $\textit{in vitro}$ and $\textit{in vivo}$ contexts.</description>

      <title>nach0: Multimodal Natural and Chemical Languages Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially driven scientific progress in various domains, and many papers have demonstrated their ability to tackle complex problems with creative solutions. Our paper introduces a new foundation model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks: biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation, molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain and multi-task encoder-decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework, enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. Furthermore, it can generate high-quality outputs in molecular and textual formats, showcasing its effectiveness in multi-domain setups.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive and Fine-grained Anomaly Detection for Single-cell Sequencing Data and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fined-grained anomalous cell detection from affected tissues is critical for clinical diagnosis and pathological research. Single-cell sequencing data provide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly detection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample and multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous cells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth, a novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates the detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous cells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first theoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative models for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us to develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer in ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types of tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/ACsleuth.</description>
