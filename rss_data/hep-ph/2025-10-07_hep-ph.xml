      <title>First Demonstration that Quark-Gluon Plasma has a Nonzero Resolution Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our investigation in arXiv:2509.08881 of how recent jet substructure measurements constrain the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. $L_{\rm res}$ is defined such that high-energy partons within a jet shower are resolved by the medium if and only if they are separated by a distance greater than $L_{\rm res}$. Using the Hybrid Model, we reproduce ALICE data on the scaled Soft Drop angle $\theta_g$ for $R=0.2$ charged-particle jets and ATLAS data on the Hard Group angle $\Delta R_{12}$ for $R=1$ jets reclustered from skinny $R = 0.2$ inclusive subjets. We find that the narrowing of the $\theta_g$-distribution in PbPb collisions observed by ALICE and the suppression of $R=1$ jets with multiple skinny subjets in PbPb collisions observed by ATLAS rule out $L_{\rm res} = \infty$, where each entire parton shower loses energy to the plasma coherently as if it were a single colored object. We then compare Hybrid Model calculations to ATLAS measurements of $R_{\rm AA}$ of $R=1$ jets reclustered from $R=0.2$ subjets, as a function of the Soft Drop angle $dR_{12}$ obtained by grooming all charged-particle tracks associated with each $R=1$ jet. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the ATLAS data is inconsistent with $L_{\rm res} = 0$, where the plasma resolves every splitting in a parton shower. Our results agree best with the data when QGP possesses a finite, nonzero $L_{\rm res}\sim (1-2)/(\pi T)$.</description>

      <title>Colibri: A new tool for fast-flying PDF fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Colibri, an open-source Python code that provides a general and flexible tool for PDF fits. The code is built so that users can implement their own PDF model, and use the built-in functionalities of Colibri for a fast computation of observables. It grants easy access to experimental data, several error propagation methodologies, including the Hessian method, the Monte Carlo replica method, and an efficient numerical Bayesian sampling algorithm. To demonstrate the capabilities of Colibri, we consider its simplest application: a polynomial PDF parametrisation. We perform closure tests using a full set of DIS data and compare the results of Hessian and Monte Carlo fits with those from a Bayesian fit. We further discuss how the functionalities illustrated in this example can be extended to more complex PDF parametrisations. In particular, the Bayesian framework in Colibri provides a principled approach to model selection and model averaging, making it a valuable tool for benchmarking and combining different PDF parametrisations on solid statistical grounds.</description>

      <title>Foundation models for equation discovery in high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, large machine learning models trained on broad, multimodal datasets, have been gaining increasing attention in scientific applications due to their strong performance on diverse downstream tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent instance of foundation models, have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as text and image generation. In this work, we investigate their potential for equation discovery in high energy physics, focusing on symbolic regression. We apply the LLM-SR methodology both to benchmark problems of equation recovery in lepton angular distributions and to the discovery of functional forms for angular coefficients in electroweak boson production at the Large Hadron Collider, observables of high phenomenological relevance for which no closed-form expressions are known from first principles. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR can uncover compact, accurate, and interpretable equations across in-domain and out-of-domain kinematic regions, effectively incorporating embedded scientific knowledge and offering a promising new approach to equation discovery in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Flavour, Accidentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of flavour models in which the spurion which breaks Standard Model flavour symmetries transforms in a non-minimal representation. Hierarchies in fermion masses, which arise from multiple insertions of this spurion, may be generated in a technically natural, accidental manner, from a handful of untuned $\mathcal{O}(1)$ elements in the UV. This relies explicitly on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry, distinguishing it from standard Froggatt-Nielsen-like scenarios. The pattern of flavour violating operators at dimension-6 can radically differ from previously considered scenarios, and emphasises the need for a broad flavour programme across all generations.</description>

      <title>Effects of hadronic molecule $N(2080)3/2^-$ on $K^{*+}\Lambda$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 101}, 014003 (2020)], we have analyzed all available data on differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements for the $\gamma p \to K^{\ast +} \Lambda$ reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach. There, the $t$-channel $K$, $K^*$, and $\kappa$ exchanges, the $u$-channel $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and $\Sigma^*$ exchanges, the $s$-channel $N$, $N(2060)5/2^-$, and $N(2000)5/2^+$ exchanges, and the interaction current were taken into account in constructing the reaction amplitudes. It was found that, overall, the agreement of the theoretical results with the corresponding data is fairly good. However, noticeable discrepancies between the model results and the data on spin density matrix elements $\rho_{00}$ are still observed in the center-of-mass energy region around $W \approx 2.08$ GeV, indicating the need for additional reaction mechanisms. On the other hand, the hidden-strange pentaquark-like state $N(2080)3/2^-$, which is proposed to be a $K^*\Sigma$ molecular state as the strange partner of $P_c(4457)$ hadronic molecule, has been found to play quite active roles in reproducing the data for $K^{*+}\Sigma^0$, $K^{*0}\Sigma^+$, and $\phi p$ photoproduction reactions. Based on these observations, in the present work, we reanalyze the data for the $\gamma p \to K^{\ast +} \Lambda$ reaction by incorporating the pentaquark-like state $N(2080)3/2^-$ in our previously proposed model. The results show that with the inclusion of the contributions of $N(2080)3/2^-$, the quality of the theoretical description of the $\gamma p \to K^{*+}\Lambda$ data can be considerably improved.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Radiative Decays of $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ Baryons in a Quark-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the spectra and radiative decays of the triply heavy baryons $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ within a quark-diquark framework using a relativistic screened potential model. The analysis is carried out by solving a relativized Hamiltonian for a two-body bound system: the diquark masses are first determined, after which each baryon is treated as a composite of the diquark and the third quark. Employing the obtained wave functions, we calculate electromagnetic transitions using the E1 and M1 operators. We report complete $N_{d} L_{d} n_{q} l_{q}$ spectra together with E1/M1 decay widths for radially and orbitally excited states, and systematically compare our results with those from other theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics with the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an introduction to collider phenomenology, explaining how theoretical concepts are translated into experimental analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Beginning with the principles of collider operation and detector design, it outlines how collisions of protons are modelled through parton distribution functions, hard matrix elements, parton showers, and hadronisation. The discussion then turns to the reconstruction of physical objects and the definition of kinematic observables that expose the quantum numbers and dynamics of the underlying interactions. Special emphasis is placed on jet physics, including infrared- and collinear-safe algorithms, grooming and tagging techniques, and modern reconstruction approaches to jet substructure. The chapter introduces event selection strategies, object identification, and multivariate classification methods, before presenting the statistical framework underpinning modern collider analyses, from likelihood construction to hypothesis testing and uncertainty treatment. Three representative case studies, the Higgs discovery in the diphoton channel, high-mass dilepton resonance searches, and constraints on new physics through the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, demonstrate how these ingredients combine in end-to-end analyses. The chapter concludes with a perspective on future colliders and the growing role of open data and simplified likelihoods in enabling reinterpretation and global fits.</description>

      <title>Angular observables and branching ratio for $B_s\to \phi \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an analysis of the $B_s\to \phi \ell^+ \ell^-$ rare decay is presented within the framework of the covariant confined quark model. The $B_s\to \phi$ transition form factors are calculated and then used to compute the branching fractions and angular observables in various $q^2$ bins, including the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, the longitudinal polarization $F_L$, and the optimized observables $A_i$ and $S_i$. The results show agreement with the latest experimental data given by LHCb collaboration and compared with available theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A reassessment of the role of high $x$ data on the MSHT global PDF fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updates within the MSHT global PDF fit that focus on the high $x$ region, and on improving our understanding of the interplay of various theoretical contributions and experimental constraints here. We revisit the question of target mass and higher twist corrections, considering their impact for the first time at approximate N$^3$LO order in a global PDF analysis. Their inclusion is found to be moderate but not negligible on both the PDFs and preferred value of the strong coupling. Increased stability in these at aN$^3$LO is observed in comparison to lower orders. We also study the impact of an updated treatment of various fixed-target DIS data, the inclusion of Seaquest fixed-target Drell Yan data, and new ZEUS data that extends coverage into the high $x$ region. The Seaquest data have the largest effect of these, in particular on the light quark separation at high $x$, while the impact of the other updates is rather mild.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the transition form factors of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia and corresponding semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia $\psi_J$ ($J=1,2,3$) and $\eta_{c2}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the estimated vector and axial vector form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_c\to\psi_Jl\bar{\nu_l}$ and $B_c\to\eta_{c2}l\bar{\nu_l}$. Our results indicate that the semileptonic decay branching ratios of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia decreases as the total angler momentum of the final state $D$-wave charmonia increases. For decay processes $B_c\to \psi_1l\bar{\nu}_l$, $B_c\to \psi_2[\eta_{c2}]l\bar{\nu}_l$ and $B_c\to \psi_3l\bar{\nu}_l$, the branching ratios can reach the order $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively, which can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements for $B_c$ meson by LHCb collaboration. Furthermore, these results also can provide useful information to study the properties of $B_c$ meson and $D$-wave charmonia.</description>

      <title>Prospects for compact hexaquarks under the limitation imposed by quark confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitation of flavor constituents for compact multiquarks is crucial for understanding the strong interaction at the low energy scale. Utilizing the MIT bag model that incorporates perturbative interactions and confinement energy $E_{\rm CON}$, we derive a critical bag radius $R_c=5.61\,$GeV$^{-1}$ from the condition $E_{\rm CON} &lt; 0$ at zero temperature and zero baryon density, which aligns with the string-breaking distance of 1.2--1.4$\,$fm. Applying this framework to 6-, 7-, and 8-quark systems, we find the bag radii $R_0$ to be highly sensitive to relativistic effects from light quarks, leading to the exclusion of most heavy-light flavor configurations (e.g., $n^3\bar{c}^3$, $n^3\bar{n}\bar{c}^2$) due to positive $E_{\rm CON}$ and radii exceeding the critical radius. Color-spin wavefunctions are constructed using Young tableaux to evaluate interaction matrices and OZI-superallowed decays. Broad decay widths in fully heavy systems for OZI-superallowed modes could arise from wavefunction overlaps due to heavy flavor symmetry, suggesting possible narrow widths for $nnb\bar{b}\bar{b}\bar{b}$ and $nnn\bar{b}\bar{b}\bar{b}$ hexaquarks. This phenomenological approach provides insights into the limitations on multiquarks imposed by confinement. It recommends experimental searches at LHCb for these states.</description>

      <title>Revisit of the electromagnetic correction to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ and its implication for muon $g-2$ based on $\tau$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we focus on the evaluation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the $\pi\pi$ channel to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ by using the experimental $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ data. The isospin breaking corrections play the decisive role in this approach of computing $a_\mu$. One of such important isospin breaking sources is the long-distance electromagnetic correction factor $G_{\rm EM}$ of the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ process from the real photon radiation. The latter effect can be calculated from the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau\gamma$ amplitude, which is revised in this work within the resonance chiral theory by simultaneously including the even-intrinsic-parity and odd-intrinsic-parity resonance operators. We update the determination of the only unknown resonance coupling through the $\omega\to\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$ decay by including contributions from both the vector and scalar resonances. By taking other remaining contributions from the muon $g-2$ White Paper 2025, we further revise the complete value of $a_\mu$, which turns out to deviate from the newest world average result after Fermilab's measurement at the level of 2.7 $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Qubit entanglement from forward scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra of $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $qq\bar{s}\bar{s}$ Tetraquarks using Regge Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the mass spectra of $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $qq\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks by employing Regge phenomenology. We calculate the range for ground state masses of $qq\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks, and estimate the Regge parameters for their trajectories in $(J,M^2)$ plane. Using these Regge parameters we have calculated range for the excited state masses of $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $qq\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks in $(J,M^2)$ plane. Also, we have investigated the mass spectra of $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $qq\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks for their excited radial states in $(n,M^2)$ plane. We predict the potential quantum numbers of some newly observed experimental states, which necessitate additional validation, and assess the higher orbital and radial excited states that may be identified in the near future. The obtained mass relations and mass values of tetraquarks can be useful in future experimental searches and the spin-parity assignment of these states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the structure and properties of tetraquarks, contributing to the broader understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Subleading Twist-3 Gluon Generalized Parton Distributions in the Light-Front Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the twist-3 generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for gluons in the proton. Our analysis is performed within a light-front constituent model where the proton is treated as a two-body state of a spin-1 gluon and a spin-1/2 spectator system. The requisite light-front wave functions are derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD correspondence. We compute the complete set of twist-3 gluon GPDs over a broad kinematic range. The corresponding distributions in impact parameter space are obtained via Fourier transform, revealing the transverse spatial distribution of gluons. Furthermore, we evaluate the contribution of these GPDs to the gluon kinetic orbital angular momentum (OAM) and compare our findings with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Dirac neutrino and dark matter in left-right symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino mass generation and dark matter in a left-right symmetric model. The model is based on an $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory with a softly broken parity symmetry. Masses of the charged leptons and neutrinos are generated radiatively at one-loop and three-loop level respectively, through their interactions with newly introduced neutral fermion and scalar particles. A mass hierarchy of those new particles is required to reproduce the observed patterns of the charged lepton spectrum and neutrino oscillation data. The resulting light particles, whose mass can be as light as GeV, serve as good dark matter candidates. The phenomenology of such dark matter candidates is governed by their interactions to left- or right-handed neutrinos. We study physics of dark matter with several benchmark parameter sets that reproduce the realistic neutrino mass matrix structure, and identify viable parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Improving on the Pythia modelling of equal-scale multi-parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-parton distribution functions (mPDFs) are non-perturbative objects that are important in the prediction of multiple scattering rates at hadron colliders. In the case where the scales associated with all partons in the mPDF are the same, we have two theoretical constraints on the mPDF. These are symmetry in exchange of the parton indices, and the number and momentum sum rules. In a previous publication (arXiv:2208.08197) we found that the equal-scale mPDFs from the Pythia model could not satisfy both of these constraints simultaneously. In this paper we introduce an algorithm for constructing equal-scale mPDFs that is based on the Pythia procedure but has three additional modifications, such that it yields symmetric mPDFs that should satisfy the sum rules to an improved extent. We test the construction for the case of the double and triple parton distribution functions (dPDFs and tPDFs), finding that the sum rules are obeyed to within 10% over the vast majority of the phase space for the scales tested (and deviations only being mildly above this level). We use our dPDFs to compute rapidity asymmetries for same-sign WW and ZZ production via double parton scattering, and compare the results to predictions obtained using Pythia and the GS09 dPDFs of arXiv:0910.4347.</description>

      <title>On the threshold behaviour of heavy top production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of an excess of ttbar production in the threshold region, by CMS and ATLAS, has been interpreted as a toponium contribution, i.e. from below-threshold ttbar virtual states. The news here is the nontrivial experimental extraction of such a signal, not its existence as such. Indeed, already 35+ years ago an NRQCD Green's function approach was used to model the above- and below-threshold production of ttbar pairs in pp/ppbar collisions. The relevant cross section equations from that study are now (re-)implemented in the Pythia 8 event generator. While the above-threshold part is straightforward, the physical interpretation and modelling of below-threshold events is nontrivial, and a final prescription is cross-checked against two simpler ones. Cross sections and some event properties are presented.</description>

      <title>Mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majarano fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. Either $S$ or $\chi$ relic density can be generated via the "Freeze-out" mechanism. In contrast, the other DM candidate relic density is obtained by the "Freeze-in" mechanism, and we therefore have two different cases. In the case of $\chi$ as WIMP and $S$ as FIMP, we perform random scans to estimate the allowed parameter space consistent with the dark matter constraint. The results show that this case is viable over a wide range of dark matter masses with the Yukawa coupling of $S_0$ and $\chi$ should be larger than 1. Instead, for the case of $S$ as WIMP and $\chi$ as FIMP, the viable parameter space is more constrained by the direct detection experiements, and we have two regions with $m_S \approx 62.5$ GeV and $m_S&gt;400$ GeV under the constraints, which is consistent with the singlet scalar DM result but the scalar DM mass can be as low as a few hundred GeV for the heavy mass region in the model.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor particle production in p+p collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heavy-flavored baryon and meson production in proton-proton (pp) collisions provides crucial insight into the hadronization mechanisms of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work an attempt has been made to describe the existing ALICE and LHCb results on the $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential production cross-section of $\Lambda_c^+$, $D^0$, $\Lambda_b^0$ and $B^0$ ($\bar{B}^0$), and $p_\mathrm{T}$-dependent $\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ and $\Lambda_b^0/B^0(\bar{B}^0)$ ratios, in light of the color-string junction inspired PYTHIA-8.314 model. A comparison of the results obtained with various datasets generated with different tuning parameters and the existing experimental results of ALICE and LHCb at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and $13$ TeV underlines the relevance of string-junction dynamics in heavy-flavored particle production. The results of the present investigation reveal that while stopping the junction-antijunction reconfiguration in the non-perturbative PYTHIA-8.314 model successfully describes the considered ALICE experimental observables of the charm sector, on the other hand, allowing junction-antijunction reconfiguration, keeping other fragmentation parameters the same, better describes the LHCb experimental observables of both charm and bottom sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper description of the non-equilibrium matter preceding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions and its observable consequences remain a major theoretical challenge, while at the same time offering new opportunities for experimental exploration. In these proceedings, I provide an overview of studies presented in talks and posters at Quark Matter 2025 on this topic. We will focus on the latest developments regarding the features and the numerical description of the non-equilibrium pre-QGP matter, as well as the potential to use hard probes as a means to study the hydrodynamization dynamics of the QCD plasma.</description>

      <title>Resonant Singly Heavy Pentaquarks in the MIT Bag Model: Mass Spectra and Strong Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the limits of color interactions in multiquark states is an important topic. Based on the bag confinement picture of hadrons, we find that for singly heavy pentaquarks, the bag confinement radius precisely falls within the range of color interaction limits provided by lattice QCD, approximately 1.17--1.29$\,\text{fm}$. This leads us to believe that singly heavy pentaquark states have the potential to form resonant states. Inspired by singly heavy baryons, we consider the mirror pentaquarks of singly heavy baryons. Furthermore, we adopt the MIT bag model, taking into account chromomagnetic and color-electric interactions between heavy and strange quarks, to calculate the mass spectrum of singly heavy pentaquarks configured as $qqqQ\bar{q}$ and analyze the stability of their S-wave two-body strong decays. We show that for the singly heavy pentaquark system, the masses are generally about $500\, \text{MeV}$ higher than the corresponding mirror baryon ground state masses, which is consistent with conclusions drawn from chiral methods. We also provide a mass mapping relationship between singly heavy pentaquarks and singly heavy baryons based on light quark flavor symmetry. The analysis of strong decays indicates that these singly heavy pentaquarks are unstable with respect to strong decays, which is consistent with our initial hypothesis.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Effects in the Neutrino Matter Potential and Implications for Non-Standard Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we emphasize that it is necessary to take into account one-loop corrections of $2.0\%$ to the neutrino matter potential in the precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and in the experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. With the numerical simulation of the DUNE experiment, we study how radiative corrections to the matter potential affect neutrino oscillation probabilities, and thus, the event rates in the presence of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs). We find that neglecting one-loop corrections may lead to wrong conclusions for the discovery of NSIs. The implications for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and constraints on the NSI parameters in future long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments are explored in a quantitative way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle physics classification often assumes flat geometry, ignoring the curved statistical structure of collision data. We present a geometric framework for Vector Boson Fusion Higgs classification that combines physics-inspired observables with product manifold neural networks. The method unifies Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical representations to capture nonlinear correlations among kinematic features. Geometric embedding yields measurable improvements over flat baselines, demonstrating that curvature-aware architectures recover information lost in standard approaches. The study highlights how incorporating geometric structure enhances discrimination power in high-energy collision data.</description>

      <title>Internal multiplicity distributions of jets from nonlinear evolution within the jet function framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets selected with high internal charged-particle multiplicity exhibit markedly different substructure patterns compared to inclusive jet samples. Such correlations motivate a systematic study of jet observables as a function of the normalized multiplicity, $\nu = N_{\rm ch}/\langle N_{\rm ch}\rangle$. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the full charged-particle multiplicity distribution of exclusive and inclusive jets, formulated within the jet-function approach. The hard production and jet function are evaluated at NLO+LL$_R$ accuracy. The internal parton dynamics governing the multiplicity distribution are described by coupled nonlinear branching equations with angular ordering, supplemented by a nonperturbative modeling term that accounts for hadron-level effects. The resulting predictions are validated against \textsc{Pythia8} simulations and compared with CMS data. We examine the effects of both nonperturbative and perturbative components in shaping the multiplicity distribution, and show that Koba--Nielsen--Olesen (KNO) scaling is notably violated in the region $\nu &gt; 2$ in the full solution, with a trend consistent with Monte Carlo results. This framework that numerically solves the nonlinear multiplicity evolution goes beyond DLA-like approximations and reproduces key features seen in event generators, providing a solid foundation for future investigations of multiplicity -- conditioned jet substructure within the jet function formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of evolution equations which govern the high-energy behavior of power-suppressed scattering amplitudes. The equations can be viewed as a renormalization group flow with respect to the relevant effective field theory cutoff. A distinct feature of the method is in the use of a multidimensional cutoff to separate the relevant scales in problems characterized by a complex factorization structure. By adjusting the renormalization group variables to the geometry of the effective theory modes, our method naturally extends to a broad spectrum of physical problems including massive, massless, small, and wide angle scattering. We present applications to the benchmark processes of electron-positron forward annihilation and light quark mediated Higgs boson production/decays.</description>

      <title>Probing the Higgs potential at a Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\gamma\gamma$ collider, either in conjunction with an $e^+e^-$ linear collider or as a stand-alone facility, offers a very attractive Higgs physics programme at relatively low centre-of-mass (c.m.) energies. While the Higgs boson that has been discovered at the LHC can be studied in detail in resonant production at 125~GeV, a c.m.\ energy as low as 280~GeV can probe the Higgs potential via the Higgs pair production process providing access to the trilinear Higgs-boson self-coupling. High polarisation of the photon beams (produced via Compton back-scattering) can be achieved and adjusted by flipping the polarisation of the incident laser. The prospects for exploring the Higgs pair production process at a $\gamma\gamma$ collider are assessed by comparing different running scenarios utilising different types of the incident laser. The possibility to use photon polarisations for disentangling different kinds of contributions to the Higgs pair production process is emphasised.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charm baryon decays provide a complementary probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study the decay $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda (p \pi) \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$ in a model-independent effective field theory framework. This study covers both the left-handed and right-handed neutrino interactions in the $c \to s \mu \nu_{\mu}$ transition. For the left-handed neutrino operators, we incorporate the implications of the Standard Model effective field theory and do a global fit considering several observables sensitive to these operators. Based on the allowed parameter space of the new-physics operators, we analyze the differential rates, forward-backward asymmetries, polarization asymmetries of the final-state hadron and lepton in $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$, and the angular coefficients in 4-body angular distribution of $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda (\to p \pi) \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$. Our results highlight distinctive signatures of certain operators involving right-handed quark currents and provide predictions that can be tested at BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Barnett effect as a new source of magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barnett effect is a fundamental magnetomechanical phenomenon in which a ferromagnetic material becomes magnetized under rotation. Using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) model under rigid rotation, we compute the Barnett magnetization ($M_{\rm Barnett}$) and show that it produces a magnetic field ($B_{\text{ind}}$) comparable in magnitude to the well-known external field ($B_{\text{ext}}$) from spectator protons at low energy heavy-ion collisions. This finding establishes the Barnett effect as a previously overlooked but essential source of magnetization and magnetic field in the heavy-ion collisions, with profound implications for understanding spin dynamics and anomalous transport in quantum chromodynamics under extreme rotation.</description>

      <title>NeoPDF: A fast interpolation library for collinear and transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NeoPDF, an interpolation library that supports both collinear and transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions. NeoPDF is designed to be fast and reliable, with modern functionalities that target both current and future hadron collider experiments. It aims to address the shortcomings of existing interpolation libraries while providing additional features to support generic non-perturbative functions. Some of the features include a new interpolation based on Chebyshev polynomials, as well as the ability to interpolate along the nucleon number $A$, the reference strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$, and the parton's intrinsic transverse momentum $k_T$. NeoPDF implements its own file format using binary serialisation and lossless compression, prioritising speed and efficiency. A no-code migration design is provided for LHAPDF in order to remove the frictions associated with transitioning to NeoPDF. The library is written in Rust with interfaces for various programming languages such as Fortran, C, C++, Python, and Mathematica. We benchmark NeoPDF against LHAPDF and TMDlib for various sets and show that it is both fast and accurate.</description>

      <title>Rapid event extraction and tensorial event adaption: Libraries for efficient access and generic reweighting of parton-level events and their implementation in the MadtRex module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Rex and teaRex, C++17 libraries for efficient management of parton-level hard scattering event information and completely generic reweighting of such events, respectively. Rex is primarily an interfacing and I/O library for Les Houches Event format files and provides an internal event format designed with data parallelism in mind, and teaRex extends this format to provide full parton-level reweighting functionality with minimal code needing to be written by the end user. These libraries serve as the foundation for the MadtRex reweighting module for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, extending the functionality of the CUDACPP plugin to allow for data-parallel model-generic leading order parameter reweighting on SIMD-enabled CPUs and SIMT GPUs, speeding up reweighting by more than two orders of magnitude compared to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO running on the exact same hardware while providing trivial scalability to larger and distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric pion, kaon, and muon fluxes for sub-orbital experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays interacting with the Earth's atmosphere generate extensive air showers, which produce Cherenkov, fluorescence and radio emissions. These emissions are key signatures for detection by ground-based, sub-orbital, and satellite-based telescopes aiming to study high energy cosmic ray and neutrino events. However, detectors operating at ground and balloon altitudes are also exposed to a background of atmospheric charged particles, primarily pions, kaons, and muons, that can mimic or obscure the signals from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use coupled cascade equations to calculate the atmospheric pion, kaon and muon fluxes reaching detectors at various altitudes. Our analysis focuses on energies above 10 GeV, where the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on particle trajectories is minimal. We provide angular and energy-resolved flux estimates and discuss their relevance as background for extensive air shower detection. Our results are potentially relevant for interpreting data from current and future balloon-borne experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and for refining trigger and veto strategies in Cherenkov and fluorescence telescopes.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical treatment of bottomonium suppression and regeneration in $p+{\rm Pb}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bottomonium suppression in $p+ {\rm Pb}$ relative to $p+p$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 5.02$ and 8.16~TeV. Specifically, we combine cold nuclear matter effects (nuclear modifications of the parton densities, energy loss and momentum broadening) with those from hot nuclear matter (suppression and regeneration) by implementing the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in hydrodynamic simulations. Bottomonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma is evaluated semiclassically, employing two different reaction rates. The first includes quasi-free inelastic scattering and gluo-dissociation employing a perturbative coupling to the medium. The second is based on in-medium $T$-matrix calculations where the input potential is constrained by lattice quantum chromodynamics to extract the bottomonium masses and dissociation rates. These semiclassical results are compared to previous calculations in an open quantum systems approach and to the experimental data. Predictions for $\chi_b$ suppression at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$~TeV are also presented.</description>

      <title>Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in the holographic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma.</description>

      <title>The Role of Acoustic Instability in Cosmic-Ray Self-Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extra radiation injection after neutrino decoupling in the early Universe contributes to the effective number of neutrino species that can be constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.</description>

      <title>On the universal content of the proper time flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbative structure of the proper time renormalization group flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories. Although the PT flow does not belong to the class of exact functional renormalization group equations, we show that it correctly reproduces the universal coefficients of the $\beta$-functions at one and two loops. For the ${\rm O(N)}$ scalar theory, we derive the one- and two-loop contributions to the running quartic coupling and also confirm the expected anomalous dimension. For the ${\rm SU(N)}$ Yang-Mills theory, using the background field method, we compute the gauge coupling renormalization recovering the correct two-loop $\beta$-function without generating any gauge-symmetry-violating term. These results highlight that, despite its limitations for reconstructing the full effective action, the PT flow retains the essential universal content of renormalization, accounting for its reliability in diverse applications ranging from statistical models to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIb. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of non-orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic dark matter (or macro) provides a broad class of alternative candidates to particle dark matter. These candidates would transfer energy primarily through elastic scattering, and this linear energy deposition would produce observable signals if a macro were to traverse the atmosphere. We study the fluorescence emission produced by a macro passing through the atmosphere. We estimate the sensitivity of EUSO-SPB2 to constrain the two-dimensional parameter space ($\sigma$ vs. $M$), where $M$ is the macro mass and $\sigma$ its cross sectional area.</description>

      <title>Global Lepton Flavour Violating Constraints on New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating observables to new physics. We parametrize generic new physics through the Effective Field Theory formalism and perform global fits beyond the common one-operator-at-a-time analyses to investigate how much present data is able to constrain the full parameter space. We particularly focus on leptonic and semileptonic operators with light quarks, identifying unbounded flat directions, detailing how many are present and which operators are involved. The analysis is performed in the general LEFT formalism, which contains all possible low-energy effective operators relevant for lepton flavour violation, as well as in more restricted scenarios, when operators come from a SMEFT completion. We find that flat directions play no role in the fully leptonic four-fermion operators. Conversely, they significantly hinder the ability to derive global bounds on semileptonic operators, with several flat or at least very poorly constrained directions preventing to fully constrain the parameter space. These results are particularly affected by the proper inclusion of uncertainties in the parameters describing $\mu-e$ conversion, which decrease the number of well-constrained directions in operator space when treated as nuisance parameters in the fit. While present data is able to provide global constraints on all operators only in the more restricted scenarios we investigated, very strong correlations among the parameters must exist to avoid conflict with the different observables. We provide correlation matrices approximating our full results as a useful tool to compare present data with particular UV completions.</description>

Abstract: Recent multi-messenger observations suggest that high-energy neutrinos may be produced close to central black holes in active galaxies. These regions may host dark-matter (DM) spikes, where the concentration of DM particles is very high. Here we explore the contribution of the DM annihilation to the target photons for the neutrino production, proton-photon interactions, estimate the associated neutrino spectrum and figure out possible future tests of this scenario.</description>

      <title>$B_{(s)} \to S(a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430), f_0(1500))$ helicity form factors within QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the helicity form factors (HFFs) of the $B_{(s)}$-meson decay into a scalar meson with a mass larger than 1~GeV, {\it i.e.,} $B \to a_0(1450)$, $B_{(s)} \to K_0^*(1430)$ and $B_{s} \to f_0(1500)$ by using light-cone sum rules approach. We take the standard currents for correlation functions. To enhance the precision of our calculations, we incorporate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections and retain the scalar meson twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes. Furthermore, we extend the HFFs to the entire physical $q^2$ region employing a simplified $z$-series expansion. At the point of $q^2=1\rm{~GeV^2}$, all NLO contributions to the HFFs are negative, with the maximum contribution around $25\%$. Then, as applications of these HFFs, we analyze the differential decay widths, branching ratios, and lepton polarization asymmetries for the semi-leptonic $B_{(s)} \to S \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$, FCNC $B_{(s)} \to S \ell \bar{\ell}$ and rare $B_{(s)} \to S \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays. Our results are consistent with existing studies within uncertainties. The current data still suffer from large uncertainties and need to be measured more precisely, which can lead to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of light scalar mesons.</description>

      <title>String loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, focusing on their role in unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological epoch and their correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a detailed analysis is provided in which the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the scales of the integer fluxes and the quantum corrections. Furthermore, we compute the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher-order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low-scale and high-scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest-lived particle into the Standard Model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ remains below the respective bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to a dark matter candidate mass ranging from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{12}\; GeV$.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$ from Inclusive Semi-leptonic $B$ Meson Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of determining the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, from the inclusive semileptonic decay width of $B$ mesons. We express the semileptonic $B$ decay width as a function of $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, $b$- and $c$-quark masses in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme. We fit $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$ to current world averages of the $B^{\pm}$ and $B^{0}$ semileptonic decay widths. This yields $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV}) = 0.245 \pm 0.009$, corresponding to a 5-flavor extrapolation of $\alpha_s(m_{Z}) = 0.1266 \pm 0.0023$. The primary uncertainty contributions arise from the uncertainty on the perturbative expansion and the value of $|V_{cb}|$. Future advancements including higher-order perturbative calculations, and precise measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ and $B$ decay widths from upcoming $B$ and $Z$ factories, could enable this method to determine $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ with a competitive precision of $\Delta\alpha_s(m_{Z}) \sim 0.0018$. This precision is comparable to the current accuracy of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ measurements from $\tau$-lepton decays, which is regarded as the most precise experimental approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of precision spectroscopy of heavy exotic atoms where electrons are substituted by negative hadrons to detect new force carriers with hadronic couplings. The selected transitions are unaffected by nuclear contact terms, thus enabling highly accurate calculations using bound-state QED, provided that the nuclear polarization is under control. Alternatively, we demonstrate that the dipole polarizability, a fundamental property of nuclei, can be extracted from the spectroscopy of exotic atoms in a novel way by combining two transitions while maintaining high sensitivity to new physics. Based on existing data, we extracted world-leading bounds on mediator masses ranging from $0.1\,$MeV to $10\,$MeV for two benchmark models and show that forthcoming experiments could enhance the sensitivity to new physics by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Contributions of $\rho(770,1450)\to \omega\pi$ for the Cabibbo-favored $D \to h\omega\pi$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration has observed the three-body decays $D_s^+\to \eta \omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S\pi^+\omega$ and $D^0\to K^-\pi^+\omega$. In this work, we investigate the contributions of the subprocesses $\rho^+\to \omega\pi^+$ in these Cabibbo-favored decays $D \to h\omega\pi$, with $\rho^+= \{\rho(770)^+, \rho(1450)^+, \rho(770)^+\&amp;\rho(1450)^+\}$ and $h=\{ \eta, K^0_S, K^-\}$, by introducing these subprocesses into the decay amplitudes of relevant decay processes via the vector form factor $F_{\omega\pi}$ which has measured in the related $\tau$ and $e^+e^-$ processes; we provide the first theoretical predictions for the branching fractions of the quasi-two-body decays $D_s^+\to\eta[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$ and $D^0\to K^-[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$. Our findings reveal that the contributions from the subprocess $\rho(770)^+\to\omega\pi^+$ are significant in these observed three-body decays $D_s^+\to\eta \omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S \omega\pi^+$ and $D^0\to K^- \omega\pi^+$, notwithstanding the contributions originating from the Breit-Wigner tail effect of $\rho(770)^+$. The numerical results of this study suggest that the dominant resonance contributions for the three-body decays $D_s^+\to\eta \omega\pi^+$ and $D^+\to K^0_S \omega\pi^+$ are originated from the $P$-wave intermediate states $\rho(770)^+$, $\rho(1450)^+$ and their interference effects.</description>

      <title>Listening for ultra-heavy dark matter with underwater acoustic detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-heavy dark matter candidates evade traditional direct detection experiments due to their low particle flux. We explore the potential of large underwater acoustic arrays, originally developed for ultra-high energy neutrino detection, to detect ultra-heavy dark matter interactions. These particles deposit energy via nuclear scattering while traversing seawater, generating thermo-acoustic waves detectable by hydrophones. We present the first robust first-principles calculation of dark matter-induced acoustic waves, establishing a theoretical framework for signal modelling and sensitivity estimates. Our framework incorporates frequency-dependent attenuation effects, including viscous and chemical relaxation, not considered in previous calculations. A sensitivity analysis for a hypothetical 100 cubic kilometre hydrophone array in the Mediterranean Sea demonstrates that such an array could extend sensitivity to the previously unexplored mass range of $0.1$-$10\,\mu\mathrm{g}$ ($\sim10^{20}$-$10^{23}\,\mathrm{GeV}$), with sensitivity to both spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions. Our results establish acoustic detection as a complementary dark matter search method, enabling searches in existing hydrophone data and informing future detector designs.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that measurements of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at spallation sources are valuable probes of muon-decay physics. Using COHERENT data we derive the first direct constraint on the Michel parameters governing the $\bar\nu_\mu$ energy distribution. We also discuss future sensitivities, the implications for the Lorentz structure of the interactions mediating muon decay and the application to other neutrino-production mechanisms like pion decay.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological implications of a class of non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through well-motivated models in particle physics, we demonstrate the power of a general class of selection rules arising from non-invertible fusion algebras that are only exact at low orders in perturbation theory. Surprisingly, these non-invertible selection rules can even be applied to the minimal extension of the Standard Model, which is to add a gauge-singlet real scalar. In this model, we show that Fibonacci fusion rules lead to experimentally testable features for the scattering processes of the real scalar. We anticipate that this class of non-invertible selection rules can be applied to a wide range of models beyond the Standard Model. To further strengthen our methodology, we discuss a dark matter model based on the Ising fusion rules, where the dark matter is labeled by the non-invertible element in the algebra, hence its stability is preserved at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled inert scalar sector with radiative neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of a model with an extended scalar sector, incorporating strongly coupled inert Higgs doublets. The model introduces three Higgs doublets: one that interacts with the $SU(2)$ symmetry of the Standard Model, and two inert doublets belonging to a strongly interacting sector, embedded in the $SU(2)_2 \times SU(2)_1 \times U(1)_Y$ electroweak gauge symmetry. This symmetry structure is further supplemented by a spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and a preserved $\mathbb{Z}_2'$ discrete symmetry. Our approach harnesses the exotic scalar fields emerging from this sector to implement mass-generation mechanisms. In particular, a one-loop seesaw mechanism accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses, while a universal seesaw mechanism naturally explains the hierarchy of charged fermion masses below the top quark mass. The model is shown to be consistent with current experimental constraints, including those from charged lepton flavor violation, electroweak precision observables, the Higgs diphoton decay rate, and the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. Notably, it also provides a viable interpretation of the 95~GeV diphoton excess, offering a distinctive signature of new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Status of the $D_s^+\to\phi\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decay with a chiral-odd $\phi$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twist-2 distribution amplitude of the $\phi$-meson has attracted considerable interest due to its unique properties. In this work, we construct the transverse leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;\phi}^\bot(x,\mu_0)$ of the $\phi$-meson using the light-cone harmonic oscillator model, in which a parameter $B_{2;\phi}^\bot$ dominantly control its longitudinal distribution. To explicitly isolate different twist contributions, we employ the right-handed chiral correlator for the QCD light-cone sum rules calculation of $D_s^+\to\phi$ decays, and further, we get the branching fraction, $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \phi e^+\nu_e )= (2.271_{-0.243}^{+0.291})\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \phi \mu^+\nu_\mu )=(2.250_{-0.240}^{+0.287})\times 10^{-2}$, where errors are squared average of the mentioned error sources. Furthermore, we have extracted the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|=0.975_{-0.066}^{+0.067}$ with improved precision through the analysis. Finally, we calculated the polarization parameter and asymmetry parameter for the $D_s^+\to\phi$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to systematically study excited light meson operators and calculate their decay constants. These operators are constructed by explicitly adding one covariant derivative to the quark-antiquark pair. In total, twelve such operators are constructed, among which ten are subjected to detailed numerical analyses. The considered quark contents include $\bar{q}q$, $\bar{q}s$, and $\bar{s}s$ ($q = u/d$), allowing the formation of various $SU(3)$ flavor nonets. For instance, our results support the interpretation that the $a_2(1320)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ constitute a flavor nonet with quantum numbers $J^{P(C)} = 2^{+(+)}$. In addition, we predict several excited meson states, whose masses and decay constants are determined using the QCD sum rule method.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we take into account the intrinsic charm and gluonic contents into the $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing scheme and formulate the tetramixing $\eta-\eta^\prime-G-\eta_c$ to study the mixing properties of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ mesons. Using the newly derived mixing parameters, we calculate the transition form factors (TFFs) of $B^+/D^+/D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}$ within the QCD light-cone sum rules up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections and twist-4 contributions. Using the extrapolated TFFs, we then calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the semi-leptonic decays $B^+/D^+/D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$. Our results are consistent with the recent Belle and BES-III measurements within reasonable errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on the method of parametric annihilators for deriving integral relations. Parametric annihilators are differential operators that annihilate multivalued integration kernels appearing in suitable integral representations of special functions. We illustrate this approach in a way that applies to a broad variety of integral representations. We describe a method for computing parametric annihilators based on efficient linear solvers and use them to derive relations between a wide class of special functions related to important problems in high-energy physics. We also formulate a similar method for deriving differential equations satisfied by the independent integrals within an integral family. We show applications to several classes of special functions, including hypergeometric functions, loop integrals in various representations (including Baikov, loop-by-loop Baikov, Lee-Pomeransky and Schwinger representations) and duals of loop integrals. We finally present the public Mathematica package CALICO for computing parametric annihilators and its usage in several examples of high relevance in theoretical particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and the reheat temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm rh}$) in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe $T_{\rm rh} \sim O(10)$ GeV and FIMP DM with mass $m_{\rm DM} \sim O(1)$ TeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (SIDIS) provides important probes of parton distributions and fragmentation functions. We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) massless QCD corrections to the full set of SIDIS coefficient functions in analytical form, accounting for electroweak neutral current and charged current exchange. Focusing on the kinematical setting of SIDIS measurements at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we quantify the impact of these corrections on the phenomenological predictions and their associated uncertainties. We study the impact of electroweak interference in the neutral current SIDIS process and investigate lepton polarisation asymmetries designed to enhance the sensitivity on charged current SIDIS.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the four-top quark operator contributions to the two-loop renormalization constants of the fermion and gluon fields, necessary to obtain the renormalization group equations for the fermion masses and the strong coupling constant. The computation has been carried out in the na\"{\i}ve dimensional regularization scheme for the $\gamma_5$ matrix. We also discuss a strategy to translate the results into the Breitenlohner--Maison--'t~Hooft--Veltman scheme and present the corresponding beta functions in both schemes.</description>

      <title>Impact of new measurements of light quarks at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a series of new measurements with both the neutral and charge current Drell--Yan processes have been performed at hadron colliders, showing deviations from the predictions of the current parton distribution functions (PDFs). In this article, the impact of these new measurements is studied by using their results to update the PDFs. Although these new measurements correspond to different boson propagators and colliding energies, they are found to have a similar impact to the light quark parton distributions with the momentum fraction $x$ around 0.1. It manifests that the deviations are consistent with each other and favor a larger valence $d_v/u_v$ ratio than the modern PDF predictions. Further study indicates that such tension arises dominantly from the deep inelastic scattering measurements of NMC and the fixed target experiments of NuSea, both of which play pivotal roles in detecting the relative $u$ and $d$ type quark contributions for modern PDFs. According to the conclusions of the impact study, it would be essential to include these new measurements into the complete PDF global analysis in the future.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Right-Handed Neutrino as a Probe of Neutrino Mass Generation in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal left-right symmetric model (mLRSM) provides an elegant and testable framework for addressing the origin of neutrino masses. We examine the constraints on the sub-GeV right-handed (RH) neutrino in the type-II seesaw scenario of the mLRSM without left-right mixing, taking limits from collider searches, meson decays, supernovae, neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and cosmology. Specifically, we derive the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay constraints using the advanced effective field theory approach and up-to-date nuclear matrix element calculations. Besides, we update the SN1987A cooling bound with the state-of-the-art simulations, provide new constraints from the energy deposition in the supernova ejecta, and incorporate the stringent RH neutrino lifetime upper limit $\tau\lesssim 0.023\text{ s}$ from the big bang nucleosynthesis. Our results identify the parameter region compatible with all current experimental and observational constraints, where the RH neutrino mass lies between 700 MeV and 1 GeV and the RH $W$ boson mass is slightly below 20 TeV. This region is exclusively probed by the future tonne-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments, providing a unique window to test the mLRSM and the possible origin of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Polarized tau decay and CP violation in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of $\tau$-lepton polarization in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) as a novel application of the intense electromagnetic fields generated in such processes. In particular, we analyze the decay distributions of polarized $\tau$-leptons produced via photon-photon fusion, focusing on both leptonic and semi-leptonic channels. We show that the external magnetic field present in UPCs induces a preferred spin quantization axis, which modifies the angular and energy distributions of $\tau$ decay products relative to the standard helicity frame. By formulating the spin polarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified polarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can retain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging. Furthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay products, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects. This framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC and future colliders to exploit polarized $\tau$ decays in UPCs as an application of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Momentum correlation in pair production by spacetime dependent fields from scattered wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Sauter-Schwinger pair production by electric fields that depend on both time and space, $E(t,z)$ and $E(t,x,y)$. For space-independent fields, $E(t)$, momentum conservation, $\delta({\bf p}+{\bf p}')$, fixes the positron momentum, ${\bf p}'$, in terms of the electron momentum, ${\bf p}$. For $E(t,z)$, on the other hand, $p_z$ and $p'_z$ are independent. However, previous exact-numerical studies have considered only the probability as a function of a single momentum variable, $P(p_z)$, $P(p'_z)$ or $P(p'_z-p_z)$, but not the correlation $P(p_z,p'_z)$. In this paper, we show how to obtain $P(p_z,p'_z)$ by solving the Dirac equation numerically. To do so, we split the wave function into a background and a scattered wave, $\psi(t,{\bf x})=\psi_{\rm back.}(t,{\bf x})+\psi_{\rm scat.}(t,{\bf x})$, where $\psi_{\rm back.}\propto\exp(\pm ipx+\text{gauge term})$. $\psi_{\rm scat.}$ vanishes outside a past light cone and is obtained by solving $(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi_{\rm scat.}=-(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi_{\rm back.}$ backwards in time starting with $\psi_{\rm scat.}(t\to+\infty,{\bf x})=0$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from high-temperature vacuum decay in scale-invariant models: nanohertz vs. millihertz regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of high-temperature vacuum decay and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background within the framework of general scale-invariant models. The effective potential is constructed to include tree-level contributions, the Coleman-Weinberg correction, finite-temperature effects, and the Daisy resummation technique, culminating in a high-temperature form. We investigate the dynamics of the first-order phase transition, calculating the critical and nucleation temperatures, the supercooling parameter, and the key transition parameters $\alpha$ (transition strength) and $\beta$ (inverse duration). The vacuum decay is found to be dominated by sphaleron transitions rather than quantum tunneling. We compute the full GW spectrum arising from bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. An extensive numerical scan reveals two distinct phenomenological regimes: one produces nanohertz-frequency GW signals potentially detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), while the other yields millihertz-frequency signals that are prime targets for future space-based interferometers like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework.</description>

Abstract: Feynman diagrams (notably the triangle diagram) involving heavy enough particles contain branch cuts on the physical sheet - anomalous thresholds - which, unlike normal thresholds and bound-state poles, do not correspond to any asymptotic $n$-particle state. ``Who ordered that?" We show that anomalous thresholds arise as a consequence of established S-matrix principles and two reasonable assumptions: unitarity below the physical region and analyticity in the mass. We find explicit nonperturbative formulas for the anomalous threshold singularity and test them against the Coleman-Thun poles of the exactly solvable $E_8$ integrable model.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the lore establishing the allowed space of field redefinitions and show that there are essentially no restrictions. Our conclusions hold to all orders in perturbation theory and for any dispersion relation. Field redefinitions can be nonlocal, symmetry breaking, or in certain cases have explicit dependence on spacetime. We address field redefinitions that can be resummed into the propagator, which demonstrates how to perform perturbative calculations away from the minimum in field space. Field redefinitions are used to derive higher-order Schwinger-Dyson equations, which imply multiparticle soft theorems. Non-standard field redefinitions are showcased using both relativistic and nonrelativistic examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter models generically include the prompt creation of highly-concentrated dark matter cusps in the early Universe. Recent studies find that these cusps can survive to the present day, as long as they do not fall into extremely dense regions of baryonic structure. In this work, we build models of dark matter annihilation within the prompt cusps that reside in galaxy clusters, showing that they dominate the total $\gamma$-ray annihilation signal. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, we find no evidence for a $\gamma$-ray excess from these sources, and set strong constraints on annihilating dark matter. These constraints generically rule out the thermal annihilation cross-section to the $b\bar{b}$ channel for dark matter masses below $\sim$200~GeV.</description>

Abstract: High-energy colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, in the presence of strong and electroweak interactions, with systems that consist of qubits (fermions) and qutrits (massive spin-1 bosons). Quantum state tomography at colliders enables the witnessing of entanglement and Bell non-locality, two defining characteristics of quantum mechanics. We offer a comprehensive explanation of the underlying principles and the methods employed to achieve this remarkable feat.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results allow the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run to be refined, leading to a constraint that is an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported (corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio which is four orders of magnitude larger). This result represents the world-leading constraint on dark photons over a wide range of masses below $6\,\rm \mu eV$ and translates to the best laboratory-based limits on the photon mass $m_\gamma&lt;2.9\times 10^{-48}\,\rm g$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of a light beta-radioactive ion using a compact ion trap by adapting the "frozen-spin" method. The measurement will be done on ions stripped of their valence electrons, thereby bypassing the significant Schiff screening that hinders the application of successful contemporary EDM searches using heavy neutral atoms and molecules to light nuclei. We identified $^8$Li as the most promising candidate for a proof-of-concept EDM search and we estimate that the current indirect proton EDM limit of a few $10^{-25} e\cdot$cm set by $^{199}$Hg measurements can be surpassed with a week of measurement time at existing facilities.</description>

Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23156$\pm$0.00024, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fluid behavior in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$ with viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applicability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems remains controversial due to the small size and short lifetime of the system. In this letter, we employ viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH), which incorporates large pressure anisotropies, to study the collectivity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$.VAH provides a good description for $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ over a wide range of multiplicities and correctly reproduces the experimentally observed negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. Traditional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH), on the other hand, can describe the measurements, in particular the negative $c_{2}\{4\}$, only with model parameters for which the bulk of the evolution is characterized by large values of the shear Knudsen number. It also can not capture the large longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy during the early evolution. These demonstrate the failure of traditional viscous hydrodynamics in small collision systems and establish viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics as a more reliable framework to describe the bulk evolution and the observed anisotropic flow in p-p collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is
  $b_F$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume formalism for $N\pi\pi$ at maximal isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N \pi \pi$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the $\Delta$ resonance in the $N\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and $1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\pi$ states, and we do not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\pi$ states cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\pi$ scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering using the three-particle $DD\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\pi\pi \leftrightarrow N\pi$ systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\pi\pi$ amplitudes arising from $N\pi\pi\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory, irrep truncations, and state preparation methods for quantum simulations of SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</description>
