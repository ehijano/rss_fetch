      <title>Setting the Stage for Uranian Seismology from Rings and Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Uranus orbiter would be well positioned to detect the planet's free oscillation modes, whose frequencies can resolve questions about Uranus's weakly constrained interior. We calculate the spectra that may manifest in resonances with ring orbits or in Doppler imaging of Uranus's visible surface, using a wide range of interior models that satisfy the present constraints. Recent work has shown that Uranus's fundamental (f) and internal gravity (g) modes have appropriate frequencies to resonate with Uranus's narrow rings. We show that even a single $\ell=2$ f or g mode detected in ring imaging or occultations can constrain Uranus's core extent and density. Fully fluid models typically have $\ell=2-7$ f mode frequencies slightly too high to resonate among the narrow rings. If Uranus has a solid core that f modes cannot penetrate, their frequencies are reduced, rendering them more likely to be observed. A single $\ell\gtrsim7$ f mode detection would constrain Uranus's unknown rotation period. Meanwhile, the different technique of Doppler imaging seismology requires specialized instrumentation but could deliver many detections, with best sensitivity to acoustic (p) modes at mHz frequencies. Deviations from uniform frequency spacing can be used to locate density interfaces in Uranus's interior, such as a sharp core boundary. Shallower nonadiabaticity and condensation layers complicate this approach, but higher-order frequency differences can be analyzed to disentangle deep and near-surface effects. The detection of normal modes by a Uranus orbiter would help to discern among the degenerate solutions permitted by conventional measurements of the planet's static gravity field.</description>

      <title>A Time-Resolved High-Resolution Spectroscopic Analysis of Ionized Calcium and Dynamical Processes in the Ultra-Hot Jupiter HAT-P-70 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first transmission spectroscopy study of an exoplanet atmosphere with the high-resolution mode of the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) instrument at the Gemini South Observatory. We observed one transit of HAT-P-70 b - an ultra-hot Jupiter with an inflated radius - and made a new detection of the infrared Ca II triplet in its transmission spectrum. The depth of the strongest line implies that a substantial amount of Ca II extends to at least 47% above the bulk planetary radius. The triplet lines are blueshifted between ~ 3 to 5 km/s, indicative of strong dayside-to-nightside winds common on highly irradiated gas giants. Comparing the transmission spectrum with atmospheric models that incorporate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects suggests that the planetary mass is likely between 1 to 2 $M_{\rm J}$, much lighter than the upper limit previously derived from radial velocity measurements. Importantly, thanks to the the high signal-to-noise ratio achieved by GHOST/Gemini South, we are able to measure the temporal variation of these signals. Absorption depths and velocity offsets of the individual Ca II lines remain mostly consistent across the transit, except for the egress phases, where weaker absorption and stronger blueshifts are observed, highlighting the atmospheric processes within the trailing limb alone. Our study demonstrates the ability of GHOST to make time-resolved detections of individual spectral lines, providing valuable insights into the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres by probing different planetary longitudes as the tidally locked planet rotates during the transit.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cislunar Orbit Lifetimes from Initial Orbital Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cislunar space is the volume between Earth's geosynchronous orbit and beyond the Moon, including the lunar Lagrange points. Understanding the stability of orbits within this space is crucial for the successful planning and execution of space missions. Orbits in cislunar space are influenced by the gravitational forces of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other Solar System planets leading to typically unpredictable and chaotic behavior. It is therefore difficult to predict the stability of an orbit from a set of initial orbital elements. We simulate one million cislunar orbits and use a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster the orbits into families based on how long they remain stable within the cislunar regime. Utilizing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) High Performance Computers (HPC) we develop a highly adaptable SOM capable of efficiently characterizing observations from individual events. We are able to predict the lifetime from the initial three line element (TLE) to within 10 percent for 8 percent of the test dataset, within 50 percent for 43 percent of the dataset, and within 100 percent for 75 percent of the dataset. The fractional absolute deviation peaks at 1 for all lifetimes. Multi-modal clustering in the SOM suggests that a variety of orbital morphologies have similar lifetimes. The trained SOMs use an average of 2.73 milliseconds of computational time to produce an orbital stability prediction. The outcomes of this research enhance our understanding of cislunar orbital dynamics and also provide insights for mission planning, enabling the rapid identification of stable orbital regions and pathways for future space exploration. As demonstrated in this study, an SOM can generate orbital lifetime estimates from minimal observational data, such as a single TLE, making it essential for early warning systems and large-scale sensor network operations.</description>

      <title>HST Transmission Spectra of the Hot-Neptune HD 219666 b: Detection of Water and the Challenge of Constraining Both Water and Methane with HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Neptunian-sized (2 - 5 R$_{Earth}$) planets appear to be extremely common in the Galaxy, many mysteries remain about their overall nature. To date, only eleven Neptunian-sized planets have had their atmospheres spectroscopically characterized, and these observations hint at interesting diversity within this class of planets. Much of our understanding of these worlds and others derive from transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). One key outcome of HST/WFC3 observations has been the consistent detection of water but no methane in Neptunian atmospheres, though recent JWST observations are potentially starting to overturn this "missing methane" paradigm. In this work, we present the transmission spectrum of the hot Neptune HD 219666 b from 1.1 - 1.6 $\mu$m from two transit observations using HST/WFC3 G141. Our fiducial atmospheric retrieval detects water at ~3-$\sigma$ in HD 219666 b's atmosphere and prefers no contribution from methane, similar to these previous observations of other planets. Motivated by recent detections of methane in Neptunian atmospheres by JWST, we explore additional models and find that a methane-only scenario could adequately fit the data, though it is not preferred and likely unphysical. We discuss the impact of this methane detection challenge on our understanding of planetary atmospheres based on HST/WFC3 observations alone, and where JWST observations offer a solution.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance. In particular, Twotinos may hide evidence of Neptune's early migration. However, these populations vary in time, declining at a rate that has not been previously clearly established. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) closest to these resonances. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance. Still, despite its distance, Pluto also strongly influences the 2:1 resonance's evolution.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Reconnaissance Observations of 21 Exoplanet Atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most prolific methods of studying exoplanet atmospheres is transmission spectroscopy, which measures the difference between the depth of an exoplanet's transit signal at various wavelengths and attempts to correlate the depth changes to potential features in the exoplanet's atmosphere. Here we present reconnaissance observations of 21 exoplanet atmospheres measured with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI), a recently deployed spectro-photometer on the McDonald Observatory Otto Struve 2.1 m telescope. ETSI measurements are mostly free of systematics through the use of a novel observing technique called common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), which has been shown to achieve photometric color precision on-par with space-based observations (300ppm or 0.03%). This work also describes the various statistical tests performed on the data to evaluate the efficacy of the CMI method and the ETSI instrument in combination. We find that none of the 8 comparisons of exoplanet atmospheres measured with ETSI and other observatories (including the Hubble Space Telescope) provide evidence that the spectra are statistically dissimilar. These results suggest that ETSI can provide initial transmission spectroscopy observations for a fraction of the observational and monetary overhead previously required to detect an exoplanet's atmosphere. Ultimately these reconnaissance observations increase the number of planets with transmission spectroscopy measurements by ~10% and provide an immediate prioritization of 21 exoplanets for future follow-up with more precious observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. The reconnaissance spectra are available through the Filtergraph visualization portal at the URL: https://filtergraph.com/etsi/.</description>

      <title>Orbital and absolute magnitude distribution of Hilda population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilda population of asteroids is located in a large orbital zone of long-term stability associated with the Jupiter J3/2 mean motion resonance. They are a sister population of the Jupiter Trojans, since both of them are likely made up of objects captured from the primordial Kuiper belt early in the solar system history. Comparisons between the orbital and physical properties of the Hilda and Trojan populations thus represent a test of outer planet formation models. Here we use a decade of observations from the Catalina Sky Survey (G96 site) to determine the bias-corrected orbital and magnitude distributions of Hildas. We also identify collisional families and the background population by computing a new catalog of synthetic proper elements for Hildas. We model the cumulative magnitude distribution of the background population using a local power-law representation with slope $\gamma(H)$, where $H$ is the absolute magnitude. For the largest Hildas, we find $\gamma\simeq 0.5$ with large uncertainty due to the limited population. Beyond $H\simeq 11$, we find that $\gamma$ transitions to a mean value ${\bar \gamma}=0.32\pm 0.04$ with a slight dependence on $H$ (significantly smaller than Jupiter Trojans with ${\bar \gamma}=0.43\pm 0.02$). We find that members of identified collisional families represent more than $60$\% of the total population (both bias counts). The bias-corrected populations contain about the same number of Hildas within the families and the background for $H\leq 16$, but this number may increase to $60$\% families when their location in the orbital space is further improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared spectroscopic characterization of the Pallas family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pallas collisional family of asteroids, named after (2) Pallas, is notable for its high orbital inclination and the distinct blue color of Pallas and a few larger B-type family members. While Pallas itself, as one of the largest asteroids, has been studied in detail, most of its smaller family members still remain unexplored. This study aims to characterize the physical properties of medium- to small-sized Pallas family asteroids to investigate the origin of their unusual blueness. Additionally, we explore the relationship between the Pallas family and the near-Earth object (NEO) (3200) Phaethon. We conducted near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to collect reflectance spectra for 22 asteroids, including one from the IRTF Legacy Archive. Spectroscopic and dynamical analyses were carried out to identify outliers, while additional data from NEOWISE and Gaia were incorporated to examine potential correlations among their physical properties. Meteorite analogs were identified through chi-square matching using samples from the RELAB database. The observed Pallas family asteroids exhibit nearly identical spectral profiles, suggesting a homogeneous composition of ejected material. Small variations in spectral slopes are observed, which may result from different levels of alteration experienced by individual asteroids, with some influence from variations in grain size. Most of the observed spectra of the Pallas asteroids, from 0.8 to 2.2 micron, closely resemble those of the CY and CI meteorites. The blueness of asteroid surfaces is likely due to the presence of magnetite, troilite, or phyllosilicates, which are products of aqueous alteration. The striking spectral similarity between (3200) Phaethon and Pallas family members of comparable sizes suggests a potential common origin.</description>

      <title>MIRI-LRS spectrum of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf: water, ammonia, and methane measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD\,0806-661\,b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12~$\mu \rm{m}$, and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21\,$\mu$m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the \textsc{TauREx} retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$, $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ($1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{\,and\,} 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD\,0806-661\,b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.</description>

      <title>Parameter degeneracies associated with interpreting HST WFC3 transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope has provided an abundance of exoplanet spectra over the years. These spectra have enabled analysis studies using atmospheric retrievals to constrain the properties of these objects. However, follow-up observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have called into question some of the results from these older datasets, and highlighted the need to properly understand the degeneracies associated with retrievals of WFC3 spectra. In this study, we perform atmospheric retrievals of 38 transmission spectra from WFC3 and use model comparison to determine the complexity required to fit the data. We explore the effect of retrieving system parameters such as the stellar radius and planet's surface gravity, and thoroughly investigate the degeneracies between individual model parameters -- specifically the temperature, abundance of water, and cloud-top level. We focus on three case studies (HD 209458b, WASP-12b, and WASP-39b) in an attempt to diagnose some of the issues with these retrievals, in particular the low retrieved temperatures when compared to the equilibrium values. Our study advocates for the careful consideration of parameter degeneracies when interpreting retrieval results, as well as the importance of wider wavelength coverage to break these degeneracies, in agreement with previous studies. The combination of data from multiple instruments, as well as analysis from multiple data reductions and retrieval codes, will allow us to robustly characterise the atmosphere of these exoplanets.</description>

      <title>HD 163296 and its Giant Planets: Creation of Exo-comets, Interstellar Objects and Transport of Volatile Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The birth of giant planets in protoplanetary disks is known to alter the structure and evolution of the disk environment, but most of our knowledge focuses on its effects on the observable gas and dust. The impact on the evolution of the invisible planetesimal population is still limitedly studied, yet mounting evidence from the Solar System shows how the appearance of its giant planets played a key role in shaping the habitability of the terrestrial planets. We investigate the dynamical and collisional transport processes of volatile elements by planetesimals in protoplanetary disks that host young giant planets using the HD163296 system as our case study. HD163296 is one of the best characterised protoplanetary disks that has been proposed to host at least four giant planets on wide orbits as well as a massive planetesimal disk. The formation of giant planets in the HD163296 system creates a large population of dynamically excited planetesimals, the majority of which originate from beyond the CO snowline. The excited planetesimals are both transported to the inner disk regions and scattered outward beyond the protoplanetary disk and into interstellar space. Existing solid planets can be enriched in volatile elements to levels comparable or larger than those of the Earth, while giant planets can be enriched to the levels of Jupiter and Saturn. The formation of giant planets on wide orbits impacts the compositional evolution of protoplanetary disks and young planetary bodies on a global scale. The collisional enrichment of the atmospheres of giant planets can alter or mask the signatures of their formation environments, but can provide independent constraints on the disk mass. Protoplanetary disks with giant planets on wide orbits prove efficient factories of interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>Too fast to be single: Tidal evolution and photometric identification of stellar and planetary companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many stars exist in binary or multiple systems where tidal interactions modify rotational evolution. In single stars, magnetic braking slows rotation, but in close binaries, tidal forces synchronize rotation, leading to high spin rates. Thus, fast rotators are often synchronized binaries or planetary systems. We analyze stellar rotation in the Kepler field to identify non-single systems photometrically. By studying young clusters, we derive an initial rotation temperature relation for single stars, validated through magnitude excess and previous binarity studies, identifying 1219 candidate non-single systems with Prot smaller than 3 days. For ultra-fast rotators (Prot smaller than 3 days), we compile a catalog of 1296 candidate ultra short period binaries, often part of hierarchical triples, reinforcing the link between rapid spins and multiplicity. Applying our method to planet-host stars, we uncover two potential circumbinary systems (Kepler 1184, Kepler 1521) and two systems possibly synchronized by close-in planets (Kepler 493, Kepler 957), with five additional cases as potential false positives. Our analysis of known non-single stars reveals clear tidal features: period synchronization, orbit circularization, and a constraint on the minimal pericenter, where rp scales as (Porb/Prot)^0.77. These findings provide new insights into tidal evolution and offer a robust method for identifying stellar multiplicity, with implications for stellar evolution, binary formation, and exoplanet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing the Flux Rope Paradigm for Coronal Mass Ejections Using a Three Spacecraft Encounter Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 3-D morphological and field reconstruction of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2023 November 28, which hits three spacecraft near 1 au: Wind at Earth's L1 Lagrange point; STEREO-A with a longitudinal separation of $6.5^{\circ}$ west of Earth; and Solar Orbiter (SolO) at $10.7^{\circ}$ east of Earth. The reconstruction assumes a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure for the CME. With this event, we test whether field tracings observed by a spacecraft passing near the central axis of a CME MFR (STEREO-A) can be used to successfullly predict the field behavior seen by a spacecraft $17^{\circ}$ away (SolO), which has a more grazing encounter with the CME. We find that the MFR model does have significant success in simultaneously reproducing the field signs and rotations seen at STEREO-A, Wind, and SolO. This provides support for the MFR paradigm for CME structure. However, the SolO measurements, which are farthest from the central axis of the MFR, show less defined MFR signatures, presumably due to a greater degree of erosion and degradation of the MFR structure far from its central axis.</description>

      <title>Rapid characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI) amalgamates a low resolution slitless prism spectrometer with custom multi-band filters to simultaneously image 15 spectral bandpasses between 430 nm and 975 nm with an average spectral resolution of $R = \lambda/\delta\lambda \sim 20$. ETSI requires only moderate telescope apertures ($\sim2$ m) and is capable of characterizing an exoplanet atmosphere in as little as a single transit, enabling selection of the most interesting targets for further characterization with other ground and space-based observatories and is also well suited to multi-band observations of other variable and transient objects. This enables a new technique, common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), used to observe transmission spectra of exoplanets transiting bright (V$&lt;$14 magnitude) stars. ETSI is capable of near photon-limited observations, with a systematic noise floor on par with the Hubble Space Telescope and below the Earth's atmospheric amplitude scintillation noise limit. We report the as-built instrument optical and optomechanical design, detectors, control system, telescope hardware and software interfaces, and data reduction pipeline. A summary of ETSI's science capabilities and initial results are also included.</description>

      <title>Potential of Ka-band Range Rate Post-fit Residuals for High-frequency Mass Change Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first extensive analysis of K/Ka-band ranging post-fit residuals of an official Level-2 product, characterised as Line-of-Sight Gravity Differences (LGD), which exhibit and showcase interesting sub-monthly geophysical signals. These residuals, provided by CSR, were derived from the difference between spherical harmonic coefficient least-squares fits and reduced Level-1B range-rate observations. We classified the geophysical signals into four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid Earth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our examination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the Argentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent remnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit residuals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia during the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies that correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we investigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to September 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These findings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal correlations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions. Given that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change phenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a high-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced spatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of magnetic activity of M dwarfs. Possible impact on the surface brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. M dwarfs are an ideal laboratory for hunting Earth-like planets, and the study of chromospheric activity is an important part of this task. On the one hand, its short-term activity show high levels of magnetic activity that can affect habitability and make it difficult to detect exoplanets orbiting around them. But on the other hand, long-term activity studies can show whether these stars exhibit cyclical behavior or not in their activity, facilitating the detection of planets in those periods of low magnetic activity. Aims. The long-term cyclical behavior of magnetic activity can be detected studying several spectral lines and explained by different stellar dynamo models. In this work, we studied the Mount Wilson $S$-index to search for evidence of activity cycles possibly driven by a solar-type dynamo. Methods. We studied a sample of 35 dM with spectral classes ranging from dM0 to dM6. To perform this, we used 2965 spectra in the optical range to build time series with extensions of up to 21 years. We have analysed thesm with different time-domain techniques to detect cyclical patterns. In addition, we have also studied the potential impact of chromospheric activity on the surface brightness. Results. Using the color index (V-Ks), we have computed the chromospheric emission levels and we found that the majority of the stars in the sample have low emission levels. In this work, we have detected 13 potential activity cycles with a duration between 3 and 19 years and with false alarm probabilities (FAPs) less than 0.1%. For stars with non-cyclic behaviour, we have found that the mean value of the $S$-Index varies between 0.350 and 1.765 and its mean variability and chromospheric emission level are around 12% and -5.110 dex, respectively. We do not find any impact of chromospheric activity on the surface brightness in the domain of -5.6 &lt; log $R'_{HK}$ &lt; -4.5.</description>

      <title>Constraining atmospheric composition from the outflow: helium observations reveal the fundamental properties of two planets straddling the radius gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-836 is a ~2-3 Gyr K dwarf with an inner super Earth ($R=1.7 R_\oplus$, $P=3.8$ d) and an outer mini Neptune ($R=2.6 R_\oplus$, $P=8.6$ d). JWST/NIRSpec 2.8--5.2 $\mu$m transmission spectra are flat for both planets. We present Keck/NIRSPEC observations of escaping helium for super-Earth b, which shows no excess absorption in the 1083 nm triplet to deep limits (&lt;0.2%), and mini-Neptune c, which shows strong (0.7%) excess absorption in both visits. These results demonstrate that planet c retains at least some primordial atmosphere, while planet b is consistent with having lost its entire primordial envelope. Self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamic models of planet c reveal that the helium excess absorption signal is highly sensitive to metallicity: its equivalent width collapses by a factor of 13 as metallicity increases from 10x to 100x solar, and by a further factor of 12 as it increases to 200x solar. The observed equivalent width is 88% the model prediction for 100x metallicity, suggesting an atmospheric metallicity similar to K2-18b and TOI-270d, the first two mini-Neptunes with detected absorption features in JWST transmission spectra. We highlight the helium triplet as a potentially powerful probe of atmospheric composition, with complementary strengths and weaknesses to atmospheric retrievals. The main strength is its extreme sensitivity to metallicity in the scientifically significant range of 10--200x solar, and the main weakness is the enormous model uncertainties in outflow suppression and confinement mechanisms, such as magnetic fields and stellar winds, which can suppress the signal by at least a factor of ~several.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>
