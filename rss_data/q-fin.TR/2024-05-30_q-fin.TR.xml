      <title>A Novel Approach to Queue-Reactive Models: The Importance of Order Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we delve into the applications and extensions of the queue-reactive model for the simulation of limit order books. Our approach emphasizes the importance of order sizes, in conjunction with their type and arrival rate, by integrating the current state of the order book to determine, not only the intensity of order arrivals and their type, but also their sizes. These extensions generate simulated markets that are in line with numerous stylized facts of the market. Our empirical calibration, using futures on German bonds, reveals that the extended queue-reactive model significantly improves the description of order flow properties and the shape of queue distributions. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the extended model produces simulated markets with a volatility comparable to historical real data, utilizing only endogenous information from the limit order book. This research underscores the potential of the queue-reactive model and its extensions in accurately simulating market dynamics and providing valuable insights into the complex nature of limit order book modeling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Broker Performance Evaluation through Intraday Modeling of Execution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing execution costs for large orders is a fundamental challenge in finance. Firms often depend on brokers to manage their trades due to limited internal resources for optimizing trading strategies. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of broker execution algorithms using trading data. We focus on two primary cost components: a linear cost that quantifies short-term execution quality and a quadratic cost associated with the price impact of trades. Using a model with transient price impact, we derive analytical formulas for estimating these costs. Furthermore, we enhance estimation accuracy by introducing novel methods such as weighting price changes based on their expected impact content. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimating both linear and impact costs, providing a robust and efficient framework for selecting the most cost-effective brokers.</description>

      <title>HLOB -- Information Persistence and Structure in Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel large-scale deep learning model for Limit Order Book mid-price changes forecasting, and we name it `HLOB'. This architecture (i) exploits the information encoded by an Information Filtering Network, namely the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph, to unveil deeper and non-trivial dependency structures among volume levels; and (ii) guarantees deterministic design choices to handle the complexity of the underlying system by drawing inspiration from the groundbreaking class of Homological Convolutional Neural Networks. We test our model against 9 state-of-the-art deep learning alternatives on 3 real-world Limit Order Book datasets, each including 15 stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange, and we systematically characterize the scenarios where HLOB outperforms state-of-the-art architectures. Our approach sheds new light on the spatial distribution of information in Limit Order Books and on its degradation over increasing prediction horizons, narrowing the gap between microstructural modeling and deep learning-based forecasting in high-frequency financial markets.</description>
