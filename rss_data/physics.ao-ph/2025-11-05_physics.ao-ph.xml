      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at \qty{1.25}{\kilo\meter} grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of \num{8192} GPUs on Alps and \num{20480} GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Risks of Typhoon-Induced Multi-Hazards in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone-induced coastal hazards can significantly damage coastal infrastructure, and these risks may intensify under future climate change. As a result, there is increasing interest in conducting comprehensive assessments of coastal hazards-including storm surge, storm wind, storm rainfall, and their combined impacts-associated with tropical cyclone events. Risk assessments that overlook the compounding nature of these hazards may lead to ineffective or insufficient mitigation strategies. This study seeks to identify and evaluate the available data, models, and methodologies for assessing both individual and compound typhoon-induced hazards in South Korea. Particular effort is devoted to exploring how established approaches from the North Atlantic region can be adapted, integrated, and extended for application in the South Korean context. Multiple sites across South Korea are analyzed to illustrate the strengths and limitations of these methods.</description>

      <title>Intercomparison of a High-Resolution Regional Climate Model Ensemble for Catchment-Scale Water Cycle Processes under Human Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding regional hydroclimatic variability and its drivers is essential for anticipating the impacts of climate change on water resources and sustainability. Yet, considerable uncertainty remains in the simulation of the coupled land atmosphere water and energy cycles, largely due to structural model limitations, simplified process representations, and insufficient spatial resolution. Within the framework of the Collaborative Research Center 1502 DETECT, this study presents a coordinated intercomparison of regional climate model simulations designed for water cycle process analysis over Europe. We analyze the performance of simulations using the ICON and TSMP1 model systems and covering the period from 1990 to 2020, comparing against reference datasets (E-OBS, GPCC, and GLEAM). We focus on 2 m air temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration over four representative basins, the Ebro, Po, Rhine, and Tisa, within the EURO CORDEX domain.
  Our analysis reveals systematic cold biases across all basins and seasons, with ICON generally outperforming TSMP1. Precipitation biases exhibit substantial spread, particularly in summer, reflecting the persistent challenge of accurately simulating precipitation. ICON tends to underestimate evapotranspiration, while TSMP1 performs better some seasons. Sensitivity experiments further indicate that the inclusion of irrigation improves simulation performance in the Po basin, which is intensively irrigated, and that higher-resolution sea surface temperature forcing data improves the overall precipitation representation. This baseline evaluation provides a first assessment of the DETECT multimodel ensemble and highlights key structural differences influencing model skill across hydroclimatic regimes.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz decompositions of horizontal structure functions including components associated with cyclone-anticyclone symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several studies have been made in which atmospheric and oceanic data were used to decompose horizontal velocity statistics into a rotational component, associated with vertical vorticity, and a divergent component, associated with horizontal divergence. Making the assumption of statistical homogeneity in a horizontal plane, this can be accomplished by relating the rotational and divergent components of the difference between the velocities at two points to the corresponding longitudinal and transverse components, where the longitudinal and transverse directions are parallel respectively perpendicular to the line between the points. In previous studies, the decomposition has most often been made under the assumption of statistical isotropy. Some attempts have also been made to analyse the anisotropic problem. We derive the full anisotropic equations relating the rotational, divergent and the rotational-divergent components of the second order structure functions to the longitudinal, transverse and longitudinal-transverse components and solve the equations analytically. We also derive some results for third order structure functions, with special focus on the components associated with cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry. Based on the analysis of these components and results from previous analyses of aircraft data, it is concluded that there is an exclusively rotational flow component that is giving rise to strong dominance of cyclonic motions in the upper troposphere and a strong dominance of anticyclonic motions in the lower stratosphere in the range of scales from ten to one thousand km</description>

      <title>Understanding Ice Crystal Habit Diversity with Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Regional Thermodynamic Trends in an AI emulator, ACE2, and a hybrid model, NeuralGCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI models have emerged as potential complements to physics-based models, but their skill in capturing observed regional climate trends with important societal impacts has not been explored. Here, we benchmark satellite-era regional thermodynamic trends, including extremes, in an AI emulator (ACE2) and a hybrid model (NeuralGCM). We also compare the AI models' skill to physics-based land-atmosphere models. Both AI models show skill in capturing regional temperature trends such as Arctic Amplification. ACE2 outperforms other models in capturing vertical temperature trends in the midlatitudes. However, the AI models do not capture regional trends in heat extremes over the US Southwest. Furthermore, they do not capture drying trends in arid regions, even though they generally perform better than physics-based models. Our results also show that a data-driven AI emulator can perform comparably to, or better than, hybrid and physics-based models in capturing regional thermodynamic trends.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale currents on significant wave height statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Precipitation Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.</description>
