      <title>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</description>

      <title>Beyond MMD: Evaluating Graph Generative Models with Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.</description>

      <title>Informational Memory Shapes Collective Behavior in Intelligent Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of 2-D swarms in which collective behavior emerges from both direct local mechanical coupling between agents and from the exchange and processing of information between agents. Each agent, an air-table drone endowed with internal memory and a binary decision variable, updates its state by integrating a time series of memories of local past collisions. This internal computation transforms the drone swarm into a dynamical information network in which history-dependent feedback drives spontaneous complete spin polarization, pitchfork bifurcated spin collectives, and chaotic switching between collective states. By tuning the depth of memory and the decision algorithm, we uncover a memory-induced phase transition that breaks spin symmetry at the population level. A minimal theoretical model maps these dynamics onto an effective potential landscape sculpted by informational feedback, revealing how temporally correlated computation can replace instantaneous forces as the driver of collective organization, informed by experiments. These results position physically interacting drone swarms as a model system for exploring the physics of informational drone ensembles whose emergent behavior arises from the interplay between physical interaction and information processing.</description>

      <title>The microscale organization of directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world complex systems are characterized by non-pairwise -- higher-order -- interactions among system's units, and can be effectively modeled as hypergraphs. Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework on empirical datasets, including Bitcoin transactions, metabolic networks, and citation data, revealing structural principles behind the organization of real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multistability and Hysteresis in Urban Congestion Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the macroscopic functional states of urban road networks exhibit multistability and hysteresis, but microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that in real-world road networks, the recovery process of congested roads is not spontaneous, as assumed in existing models, but is hindered by connected congested roads, and such hindered recovery can lead to the emergence of multistability and hysteresis in urban traffic dynamics. By analyzing real-world urban traffic data, we observed that congestion propagation between individual roads is well described by a simple contagion process like an epidemic, but the recovery rate of a congested road decreases drastically by the congestion of the adjacent roads unlike an epidemic. Based on this microscopic observation, we proposed a simple model of congestion propagation and dissipation, and found that our model shows a discontinuous phase transition between macroscopic functional states of road networks when the recovery hindrance is strong enough through a mean-field approach and numerical simulations. Our findings shed light on an overlooked role of recovery processes in the collective dynamics of failures in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic Supply Chain Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.</description>
