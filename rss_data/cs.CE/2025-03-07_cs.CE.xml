      <title>A high-order augmented basis positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for a Linear Hyperbolic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper designs a high-order positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for a linear hyperbolic equation. The scheme relies on augmenting the standard polynomial DG spaces with additional basis functions. The purpose of these augmented basis functions is to ensure the preservation of a positive cell average for the unmodulated DG solution. As such, the simple Zhang and Shu limiter~\cite{zhang2010maximum} can be applied with no loss of accuracy for smooth solutions, and the cell average remains unaltered. A key feature of the proposed scheme is its implicit generation of suitable augmented basis functions. Nonlinear optimization facilitates the design of these augmented basis functions. Several benchmarks and computational studies demonstrate that the method works well in two and three dimensions. \keywords{discontinuous Galerkin \and High-order \and Positivity-preserving</description>

      <title>High order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for three-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical solution of time-dependent three-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media. The underlying algorithm is a semi-implicit operator splitting approach that relaxes the nonlinearity present in the governing equations. By treating the subsequent equations implicitly, we obtain solution that remain stable for large time steps. The hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method allows for static condensation, which significantly reduces the total number of degrees of freedom, especially when compared to classical discontinuous Galerkin methods. Several numerical tests are given, for example, we verify analytic convergence rates for the method, as well as examine its robustness in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media.</description>

      <title>TIMER: Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for assisting in medical tasks, yet processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents unique challenges due to their longitudinal nature. While LLMs' capabilities to perform medical tasks continue to improve, their ability to reason over temporal dependencies across multiple patient visits and time frames remains unexplored. We introduce TIMER (Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records), a framework that incorporate instruction-response pairs grounding to different parts of a patient's record as a critical dimension in both instruction evaluation and tuning for longitudinal clinical records. We develop TIMER-Bench, the first time-aware benchmark that evaluates temporal reasoning capabilities over longitudinal EHRs, as well as TIMER-Instruct, an instruction-tuning methodology for LLMs to learn reasoning over time. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned with TIMER-Instruct improve performance by 7.3% on human-generated benchmarks and 9.2% on TIMER-Bench, indicating that temporal instruction-tuning improves model performance for reasoning over EHR.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for On-Demand DNN Inference in the Edge-AI Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of edge computing and AI gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications and services at the network edge. One of the fundamental research issues in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy DNN inference services by leveraging the fine-grained offloading of partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would systematically explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We investigate the multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and analyse the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties, including competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness of our auction outcomes. The extensive simulation experiments based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that our AERIA mechanism significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization, demonstrating the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale-Multiphysics Framework for Modeling Organ-scale Liver Regrowth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for modeling liver regrowth on the organ scale that is based on three components: (1) a multiscale perfusion model that combines synthetic vascular tree generation with a multi-compartment homogenized flow model, including a homogenization procedure to obtain effective parameters; (2) a poroelastic finite growth model that acts on all compartments and the synthetic vascular tree structure; (3) an evolution equation for the local volumetric growth factor, driven by the homogenized flow rate into the microcirculation as a measure of local hyperperfusion and well-suited for calibration with available data. We apply our modeling framework to a prototypical benchmark and a full-scale patient-specific liver, for which we assume a common surgical cut. Our simulation results demonstrate that our model represents hyperperfusion as a consequence of partial resection and accounts for its reduction towards a homeostatic perfusion state, exhibiting overall regrowth dynamics that correspond well with clinical observations. In addition, our results show that our model also captures local hypoperfusion in the vicinity of orphan vessels, a key requirement for the prediction of ischemia or the preoperative identification of suitable cut patterns.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance. Our code and data are available under https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/htgnn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-specific large language models (Protein LLMs) are revolutionizing protein science by enabling more efficient protein structure prediction, function annotation, and design. While existing surveys focus on specific aspects or applications, this work provides the first comprehensive overview of Protein LLMs, covering their architectures, training datasets, evaluation metrics, and diverse applications. Through a systematic analysis of over 100 articles, we propose a structured taxonomy of state-of-the-art Protein LLMs, analyze how they leverage large-scale protein sequence data for improved accuracy, and explore their potential in advancing protein engineering and biomedical research. Additionally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, positioning Protein LLMs as essential tools for scientific discovery in protein science.

      <title>RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 89.1% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</description>
