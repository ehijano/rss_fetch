      <title>Parameterized Saga of First-Fit and Last-Fit Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic greedy coloring (first-fit) algorithm considers the vertices of an input graph $G$ in a given order and assigns the first available color to each vertex $v$ in $G$. In the {\sc Grundy Coloring} problem, the task is to find an ordering of the vertices that will force the greedy algorithm to use as many colors as possible. In the {\sc Partial Grundy Coloring}, the task is also to color the graph using as many colors as possible. This time, however, we may select both the ordering in which the vertices are considered and which color to assign the vertex. The only constraint is that the color assigned to a vertex $v$ is a color previously used for another vertex if such a color is available.
  Whether {\sc Grundy Coloring} and {\sc Partial Grundy Coloring} admit fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms, algorithms with running time $f(k)n^{\OO(1)}$, where $k$ is the number of colors, was posed as an open problem by Zaker and by Effantin et al., respectively. Recently, Aboulker et al. (STACS 2020 and Algorithmica 2022) resolved the question for \Grundycol\ in the negative by showing that the problem is W[1]-hard. For {\sc Partial Grundy Coloring}, they obtain an FPT algorithm on graphs that do not contain $K_{i,j}$ as a subgraph (a.k.a. $K_{i,j}$-free graphs). Aboulker et al.~re-iterate the question of whether there exists an FPT algorithm for {\sc Partial Grundy Coloring} on general graphs and also asks whether {\sc Grundy Coloring} admits an FPT algorithm on $K_{i,j}$-free graphs. We give FPT algorithms for {\sc Partial Grundy Coloring} on general graphs and for {\sc Grundy Coloring} on $K_{i,j}$-free graphs, resolving both the questions in the affirmative. We believe that our new structural theorems for partial Grundy coloring and ``representative-family'' like sets for $K_{i,j}$-free graphs that we use in obtaining our results may have wider algorithmic applications.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Goodness of paths and unbalanced graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is $H$-$good$ if the Ramsey number $R(G,H)$ equals the trivial lower bound $(|G| - 1)(\chi(H) - 1) + \sigma(H)$, where $\chi(H)$ denotes the usual chromatic number of $H$, and $\sigma(H)$ denotes the minimum size of a color class in a $\chi(H)$-coloring of $H$. Pokrovskiy and Sudakov [Ramsey goodness of paths. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 122:384-390, 2017.] proved that $P_n$ is $H$-good whenever $n\geq 4|H|$. In this paper, given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we show that if $H$ satisfy a special unbalance condition, then $P_n$ is $H$-good whenever $n \geq (2 + \varepsilon)|H|$. More specifically, we show that if $m_1,\ldots, m_k$ are such that $\varepsilon\cdot m_i \geq 2m_{i-1}^2$ for $2\leq i\leq k$, and $n \geq (2 + \varepsilon)(m_1 + \cdots + m_k)$, then $P_n$ is $K_{m_1,\ldots,m_k}$-good.</description>

      <title>Product Structure and Tree-Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the structure of graphs defined by an excluded minor or an excluded odd minor through the lens of graph products and tree-decompositions. We prove that every graph excluding a fixed odd minor is contained in the strong product of two graphs each with bounded treewidth. For graphs excluding a fixed minor, we strengthen the result by showing that every such graph is contained in the strong product of two digraphs with bounded indegree and with bounded treewidth. This result has the advantage that the product now has bounded degeneracy.
  In the setting of 3-term products, we show that every $K_t$-minor-free graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2 \boxtimes K_{c(t)}$ where $\text{tw}(H_i)\leq t-2$. This treewidth bound is close to tight: in any such result with $\text{tw}(H_i)$ bounded, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ can be forced to contain any graph of treewidth $t-5$, implying $\text{tw}(H_1)\geq t-5$ and $\text{tw}(H_2)\geq t-5$. Analogous lower and upper bounds are shown for any excluded minor, where the minimum possible bound on $\text{tw}(H_i)$ is tied to the treedepth of the excluded minor.
  Subgraphs of the product of two graphs with bounded treewidth have two tree-decompositions where any bag from the first decomposition intersects any bag from the second decomposition in a bounded number, $k$, of vertices, so called $k$-orthogonal tree-decompositions. We show that graphs excluding a fixed odd-minor have a tree-decomposition and a path-decomposition that are $O(1)$-orthogonal. This implies that such graphs have a tree-decomposition in which each bag has bounded pathwidth. This result is best possible in that `pathwidth' cannot be replaced by `bandwidth' or `treedepth'. Moreover, we characterize the minor-closed classes that have a tree-decomposition in which each bag has bounded bandwidth, or each bag has bounded treedepth.</description>

      <title>Three observations on the Colin de Verdi\`ere spectral graph parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this small note, we collect several observations pertaining to the famous spectral graph parameter $\mu$ introduced in 1990 by Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere. This parameter is defined as the maximum corank among certain matrices akin to weighted Laplacians; we call them CdV matrices.
  First, we answer negatively a question mentioned in passing in the influential 1996 survey on $\mu$ by van der Holst, Lov\'asz, and Schrijver concerning the Perron--Frobenious eigenvector of CdV matrices.
  Second, by definition, CdV matrices posses certain transversality property. In some cases, this property is known to be satisfied automatically. We add one such case to the list.
  Third, Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere conjectured an upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into a fixed closed surface. Following a recent computer-verified counterexample to a continuous version of the conjecture by Fortier Bourque, Gruda-Mediavilla, Petri, and Pineault [arXiv:2312.03504], we also check using computer that the analogous example shows the failure of the conjectured upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into 10-torus as well as to several other larger surfaces.</description>

      <title>High-level hybridization of heuristics and metaheuristics to solve symmetric TSP: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP is one of the most explored problems in the scientific literature to solve real problems regarding the economy, transportation, and logistics, to cite a few cases. Adapting TSP to solve different problems has originated several variants of the optimization problem with more complex objectives and different restrictions. Metaheuristics have been used to solve the problem in polynomial time. Several studies have tried hybridising metaheuristics with specialised heuristics to improve the quality of the solutions. However, we have found no study to evaluate whether the searching mechanism of a particular metaheuristic is more adequate for exploring hybridization. This paper focuses on the solution of the classical TSP using high-level hybridisations, experimenting with eight metaheuristics and heuristics derived from k-OPT, SISR, and segment intersection search, resulting in twenty-four combinations. Some combinations allow more than one set of searching parameters. Problems with 50 to 280 cities are solved. Parameter tuning of the metaheuristics is not carried out, exploiting the different searching patterns of the eight metaheuristics instead. The solutions' quality is compared to those presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of Multisets with Applications to Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the reconfiguration framework to analyze problems that involve the rearrangement of items among groups. In various applications, a group of items could correspond to the files or jobs assigned to a particular machine, and the goal of rearrangement could be improving efficiency or increasing locality.
  To cover problems arising in a wide range of application areas, we define the general Repacking problem as the rearrangement of multisets of multisets. We present hardness results for the general case and algorithms for various classes of instances that arise in real-life scenarios. By limiting the total size of items in each multiset, our results can be viewed as an offline approach to Bin Packing, in which each bin is represented as a multiset.
  In addition to providing the first results on reconfiguration of multisets, our contributions open up several research avenues: the interplay between reconfiguration and online algorithms and parallel algorithms; the use of the tools of linear programming in reconfiguration; and, in the longer term, a focus on extra resources in reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1716n^2$, for all sufficiently large $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most $100$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The palindromic length of the finite word $v$ is equal to the minimal number of palindromes whose concatenation is equal to $v$. It was conjectured in 2013 that for every infinite aperiodic word $x$, the palindromic length of its factors is not bounded. We prove this conjecture to be true.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Sumsets is NP-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sumsets are central objects in additive combinatorics. In 2007, Granville asked whether one can efficiently recognize whether a given set $S$ is a sumset, i.e. whether there is a set $A$ such that $A+A=S$. Granville suggested an algorithm that takes exponential time in the size of the given set, but can we do polynomial or even linear time? This basic computational question is indirectly asking a fundamental structural question: do the special characteristics of sumsets allow them to be efficiently recognizable? In this paper, we answer this question negatively by proving that the problem is NP-complete. Specifically, our results hold for integer sets and over any finite field. Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, our lower bound becomes $2^{\Omega(n^{1/4})}$.</description>
