      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Lung Cancer Survival Time Prediction Using Clinical and Radiomics Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET, and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from TCIA and BC Cancer Agency, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.54%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08.45 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperformed SL across PET, CT, and CF. Thereby, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.54% compared to the SL approach.</description>

      <title>Human fields and their impact on brain waves A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During brain function, groups of neurons fire synchronously. When these groups are large enough, the resulting electrical signals can be measured on the scalp using Electroencephalography (EEG). The amplitude of these signals can be significant depending on the size and synchronization of the neural activity. EEG waves exhibit distinct patterns based on the brain's state, such as whether it is asleep, awake, engaged in mental calculations, or performing other cognitive functions. Additionally, these patterns can be modified by external factors, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS involves bringing an antenna that generates variable electromagnetic fields close to specific areas of the skull to treat certain pathologies. Given that the human body naturally generates magnetic fields, a question arises: Can these fields influence the EEG by modulating neuronal function, causing a resonance effect, or through some unknown interaction? This study investigated whether approaching the palm of the hand to the top of the head (Intervention) could induce effects in the EEG. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was obtained for the 30 seconds preceding the intervention (PSD_pre) and the final 30 seconds of the intervention (PSD_last). The exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggests that the median of PSD_pre is greater than the median of PSD_last at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.004353). In contrast, in the control group, the test indicates that at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.7667), the median of PSD_pre is not greater than the median of PSD_last.</description>

      <title>An altruistic resource-sharing mechanism for synchronization: The energy-speed-accuracy tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization among a group of active agents is ubiquitous in nature. Although synchronization based on direct interactions between agents described by the Kuramoto model is well understood, the other general mechanism based on indirect interactions among agents sharing limited resources are less known. Here, we propose a minimal thermodynamically consistent model for the altruistic resource-sharing (ARS) mechanism wherein resources are needed for individual agent to advance but a more advanced agent has a lower competence to obtain resources. We show that while differential competence in ARS mechanism provides a negative feedback leading to synchronization it also breaks detailed balance and thus requires additional energy dissipation besides the cost of driving individual agents. By solving the model analytically, our study reveals a general tradeoff relation between the total energy dissipation rate and the two key performance measures of the system: average speed and synchronization accuracy. For a fixed dissipation rate, there is a distinct speed-accuracy Pareto front traversed by the scarcity of resources: scarcer resources lead to slower speed but more accurate synchronization. Increasing energy dissipation eases this tradeoff by pushing the speed-accuracy Pareto front outwards. The connections of our work to realistic biological systems such as the KaiABC system in cyanobacterial circadian clock and other theoretical results based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets is essential for structure-based drug design. However, most pocket-identification algorithms prioritize their geometric properties over downstream docking performance. To address this limitation, we developed RAPID-Net, a pocket-finding algorithm for seamless integration with docking workflows. When guiding AutoDock Vina, RAPID-Net outperforms DiffBindFR on the PoseBusters benchmark and enables blind docking on large proteins that AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole. Furthermore, RAPID-Net surpasses PUResNet and Kalasanty in docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates across diverse datasets, including PoseBusters, Astex Diverse Set, BU48, and Coach420. When accuracy is evaluated as ``at least one correct pose in the ensemble'', RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Hydroelastic scattering and trapping of microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable boundaries are omnipresent in the habitats of swimming microorganisms, leading to intricate hydroelastic couplings. Employing a perturbation theory, valid for small deformations, we study the swimming dynamics of pushers and pullers near instantaneously deforming boundaries, endowed with a bending rigidity and surface tension. Our results reveal that pushers can both reorient away from the boundary, leading to overall hydroelastic scattering, or become trapped by the boundary, akin to the enhanced trapping found for pullers. These findings demonstrate that the complex hydroelastic interactions can generate behaviors that are in striking contrast to swimming near planar walls.</description>

      <title>A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient $C_D$ and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but {experimental repeats do} not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.</description>

      <title>Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced alignment of nanoparticles and macromolecules for single-particle-imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced alignment of particles and molecules was long envisioned to support three-dimensional structure determination using "single-molecule diffraction" with x-ray free-electron lasers [PRL 92, 198102 (2004)]. However, the alignment of isolated macromolecules has not yet been demonstrated, also because quantitative modeling is very expensive. We computationally demonstrated that the alignment of nanorods and proteins is possible with standard laser technology. We performed a comprehensive analysis on the dependence of the degree of alignment on molecular properties and experimental details, e.g., particle temperature and laser-pulse energy. Considering the polarizability anisotropy of about 150,000 proteins, our analysis revealed that most of these proteins can be aligned using realistic experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>The SAP-1 Payload: A Technology Demonstration for Space-Based Microbiology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuron firing and beating of cilia. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, emsemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the time development of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>
