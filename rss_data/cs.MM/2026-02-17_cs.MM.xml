      <title>SRA: Semantic Relation-Aware Flowchart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flowchart Question Answering (FlowchartQA) is a multi-modal task that automatically answers questions conditioned on graphic flowcharts. Current studies convert flowcharts into interlanguages (e.g., Graphviz) for Question Answering (QA), which effectively bridge modal gaps between questions and flowcharts. More importantly, they reveal the link relations between nodes in the flowchart, facilitating a shallow relation reasoning during tracing answers. However, the existing interlanguages still lose sight of intricate semantic/logic relationships such as Conditional and Causal relations. This hinders the deep reasoning for complex questions. To address the issue, we propose a novel Semantic Relation-Aware (SRA) FlowchartQA approach. It leverages Large Language Model (LLM) to detect the discourse semantic relations between nodes, by which a link-based interlanguage is upgraded to the semantic relation based interlanguage. In addition, we conduct an interlanguage-controllable reasoning process. In this process, the question intention is analyzed with the aim to determine the depth of reasoning (Shallow or Deep reasoning), as well as the well-matched interlanguage. We experiment on the benchmark dataset FlowVQA. The test results show that SRA yields widespread improvements when upgrading different interlanguages like Graphviz, Mermaid and Plantuml</description>

      <title>InfoCIR: Multimedia Analysis for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) allows users to search for images by combining a reference image with a text prompt that describes desired modifications. While vision-language models like CLIP have popularized this task by embedding multiple modalities into a joint space, developers still lack tools that reveal how these multimodal prompts interact with embedding spaces and why small wording changes can dramatically alter the results. We present InfoCIR, a visual analytics system that closes this gap by coupling retrieval, explainability, and prompt engineering in a single, interactive dashboard. InfoCIR integrates a state-of-the-art CIR back-end (SEARLE arXiv:2303.15247) with a six-panel interface that (i) lets users compose image + text queries, (ii) projects the top-k results into a low-dimensional space using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for spatial reasoning, (iii) overlays similarity-based saliency maps and gradient-derived token-attribution bars for local explanation, and (iv) employs an LLM-powered prompt enhancer that generates counterfactual variants and visualizes how these changes affect the ranking of user-selected target images. A modular architecture built on Plotly-Dash allows new models, datasets, and attribution methods to be plugged in with minimal effort. We argue that InfoCIR helps diagnose retrieval failures, guides prompt enhancement, and accelerates insight generation during model development. All source code allowing for a reproducible demo is available at https://github.com/giannhskp/InfoCIR.</description>

      <title>The Interspeech 2026 Audio Reasoning Challenge: Evaluating Reasoning Process Quality for Audio Reasoning Models and Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) excel in understanding but often lack transparent reasoning. To address this "black-box" limitation, we organized the Audio Reasoning Challenge at Interspeech 2026, the first shared task dedicated to evaluating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) quality in the audio domain. The challenge introduced MMAR-Rubrics, a novel instance-level protocol assessing the factuality and logic of reasoning chains. Featured Single Model and Agent tracks, the competition attracting 156 teams from 18 countries and regions. Results show agent systems currently lead in reasoning quality, utilizing iterative tool orchestration and cross-modal analysis. Besides, single models are rapidly advancing via reinforcement learning and sophisticated data pipeline. We details the challenge design, methodology, and a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art systems, providing new insights for explainable audio intelligence.</description>

      <title>GOT-JEPA: Generic Object Tracking with Model Adaptation and Occlusion Handling using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</description>

      <title>AudioX: A Unified Framework for Anything-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio and music generation based on flexible multimodal control signals is a widely applicable topic, with the following key challenges: 1) a unified multimodal modeling framework, and 2) large-scale, high-quality training data. As such, we propose AudioX, a unified framework for anything-to-audio generation that integrates varied multimodal conditions (i.e., text, video, and audio signals) in this work. The core design in this framework is a Multimodal Adaptive Fusion module, which enables the effective fusion of diverse multimodal inputs, enhancing cross-modal alignment and improving overall generation quality. To train this unified model, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, IF-caps, comprising over 7 million samples curated through a structured data annotation pipeline. This dataset provides comprehensive supervision for multimodal-conditioned audio generation. We benchmark AudioX against state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of tasks, finding that our model achieves superior performance, especially in text-to-audio and text-to-music generation. These results demonstrate our method is capable of audio generation under multimodal control signals, showing powerful instruction-following potential. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/.</description>

      <title>TriniMark: A Robust Generative Speech Watermarking Method for Trinity-Level Traceability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech generation has achieved remarkable fidelity, increasing the risk of misuse and unauthorized redistribution. However, most existing generative speech watermarking methods are developed for GAN-based pipelines, and watermarking for diffusion-based speech generation remains comparatively underexplored. In addition, prior work often focuses on content-level provenance, while support for model-level and user-level attribution is less mature. We propose \textbf{TriniMark}, a diffusion-based generative speech watermarking framework that targets trinity-level traceability, i.e., the ability to associate a generated speech sample with (i) the embedded watermark message (content-level provenance), (ii) the source generative model (model-level attribution), and (iii) the end user who requested generation (user-level traceability). TriniMark uses a lightweight encoder to embed watermark bits into time-domain speech features and reconstruct the waveform, and a temporal-aware gated convolutional decoder for reliable bit recovery. We further introduce a waveform-guided fine-tuning strategy to transfer watermarking capability into a diffusion model. Finally, we incorporate variable-watermark training so that a single trained model can embed different watermark messages at inference time, enabling scalable user-level traceability. Experiments on speech datasets indicate that TriniMark maintains speech quality while improving robustness to common single and compound signal-processing attacks, and it supports high-capacity watermarking for large-scale traceability.</description>

      <title>RAG-VisualRec: An Open Resource for Vision- and Text-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of building multimodal recommender systems for the movie domain, where sparse item metadata (e.g., title and genres) can limit retrieval quality and downstream recommendations. We introduce RAG-VisualRec, an open resource and reproducible pipeline that combines (i) LLM-generated item-side plot descriptions and (ii) trailer-derived visual (and optional audio) embeddings, supporting both retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative-filtering style workflows. Our pipeline augments sparse metadata into richer textual signals and integrates modalities via configurable fusion strategies (e.g., PCA and CCA) before retrieval and optional LLM-based re-ranking. Beyond providing the resource, we provide a complementary analysis that increases transparency and reproducibility. In particular, we introduce LLMGenQC, a critic-based quality-control module (LLM-as-judge) that audits synthetic synopses for semantic alignment with metadata, consistency, safety, and basic sanity checks, releasing critic scores and pass/fail labels alongside the generated artifacts. We report ablation studies that quantify the impact of key design choices, including retrieval depth, fusion strategy, and user-embedding construction. Across experiments, CCA-based fusion consistently improves recall over unimodal baselines, while LLM-based re-ranking typically improves nDCG by refining top-K selection from the retrieved candidate pool, especially when textual evidence is limited. By releasing RAG-VisualRec, we enable further research on multimodal RAG recommenders, quality auditing of LLM-generated side information, and long-tail oriented evaluation protocols.

      <title>NeRV360: Neural Representation for 360-Degree Videos with a Viewport Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.</description>
