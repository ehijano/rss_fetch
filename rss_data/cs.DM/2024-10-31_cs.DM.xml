      <title>Cops &amp; Robber on Periodic Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cops and Robber pursuit-evasion game when the edge-set of the graph is allowed to change in time, possibly at every round. Specifically, the game is played on an infinite periodic sequence $\mathcal{G} = (G_0, \dots, G_{p-1})^*$ of graphs on the same set $V$ of $n$ vertices: in round $t$, the topology of $\mathcal{G}$ is $G_i=(V,E_i)$ where $i\equiv t \pmod{p}$.
  Concentrating on the case of a single cop, we provide a characterization of copwin periodic temporal graphs, establishing several basic properties on their nature, and extending to the temporal domain classical C&amp;R concepts such as covers and corners. Based on these results, we design an efficient algorithm for determining if a periodic temporal graph is copwin.
  We also consider the case of $k&gt;1$ cops. By shifting from a representation in terms of directed graphs to one in terms of directed multi-hypergraphs, we prove that all the fundamental properties established for $k=1$ continue to hold, providing a characterization of $k$-copwin periodic graphs, as well as a general strategy to determine if a periodic graph is $k$-copwin.
  Our results do not rely on any assumption on properties such as connectivity, symmetry, reflexivity held by the individual graphs in the sequence. They are established for a unified version of the game that includes the standard games studied in the literature, both for undirected and directed graphs, and both when the players are fully active and when they are not. They hold also for a variety of settings not considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>MILP-StuDio: MILP Instance Generation via Block Structure Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22806v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures -- which are closely related to the problem formulations -- in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.</description>

      <title>Deduction, Constrained Zero Forcing, and Constrained Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deduction is a recently introduced graph searching process in which searchers clear the vertex set of a graph with one move each, with each searcher's movement determined by which of its neighbors are protected by other searchers. In this paper, we show that the minimum number of searchers required to clear the graph is the same in deduction as in constrained versions of other previously studied graph processes, namely zero forcing and fast-mixed search. We give a structural characterization, new bounds and a spectrum result on the number of searchers required. We consider the complexity of computing this parameter, giving an NP-completeness result for arbitrary graphs, and exhibiting families of graphs for which the parameter can be computed in polynomial time. We also describe properties of the deduction process related to the timing of searcher movement and the success of terminal layouts.</description>

      <title>Beyond hypergraph acyclicity: limits of tractability for pseudo-Boolean optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing a polynomial function with literals over all binary points, often referred to as pseudo-Boolean optimization. We investigate the fundamental limits of computation for this problem by providing new necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for tractability. On one hand, we obtain the first intractability results for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems on signed hypergraphs with bounded rank, in terms of the treewidth of the intersection graph. On the other hand, we introduce the nest-set gap, a new hypergraph-theoretic notion that enables us to move beyond hypergraph acyclicity, and obtain a polynomial-size extended formulation for the pseudo-Boolean polytope of a class of signed hypergraphs whose underlying hypergraphs contain beta-cycles.</description>

      <title>The Days On Days Off Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personnel scheduling problems have received considerable academic attention due to their relevance in various real-world applications. These problems involve preparing feasible schedules for an organization's employees and often account for factors such as qualifications of workers and holiday requests, resulting in complex constraints. While certain versions of the personnel rostering problem are widely acknowledged as NP-hard, there is limited theoretical analysis specific to many of its variants. Many studies simply assert the NP-hardness of the general problem without investigating whether the specific cases they address inherit this computational complexity.
  In this paper, we examine a variant of the personnel scheduling problems, which involves scheduling a homogeneous workforce subject to constraints concerning both the total number and the number of consecutive work days and days off. This problem was claimed to be NP-complete by [Brunner+2013]. In this paper, we prove its NP-completeness and investigate how the combination of constraints contributes to this complexity. Furthermore, we analyze various special cases that arise from the omission of certain parameters, classifying them as either NP-complete or polynomial-time solvable. For the latter, we provide easy-to-implement and efficient algorithms to not only determine feasibility, but also compute a corresponding schedule.</description>

      <title>Deterministic counting from coupling independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spin systems with bounded degrees and coupling independence admit fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). We design a new recursive deterministic counting algorithm to achieve this. As applications, we give the first FPTASes for $q$-colourings on graphs of bounded maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$, when $q\ge (11/6-\varepsilon_0)\Delta$ for some small $\varepsilon_0\approx 10^{-5}$, or when $\Delta\ge 125$ and $q\ge 1.809\Delta$, and on graphs with sufficiently large (but constant) girth, when $q\geq\Delta+3$. These bounds match the current best randomised approximate counting algorithms by Chen, Delcourt, Moitra, Perarnau, and Postle (2019), Carlson and Vigoda (2024), and Chen, Liu, Mani, and Moitra (2023), respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we introduce an algorithm that produces what appears to be a new mathematical object as a consequence of projecting the \( n \)-dimensional \( Z \)-curve onto an \( n \)-dimensional sphere. The first part presents the algorithm that enables this transformation, and the second part focuses on studying its properties.</description>

      <title>Vertex-critical graphs in co-gem-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$ but $\chi(G-v)&lt;k$ for all $v\in V(G)$ and $(G,H)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or $H$. We show that there are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ when $H$ is any graph of order $4$ by showing finiteness in the three remaining open cases, those are the cases when $H$ is $2P_2$, $K_3+P_1$, and $K_4$. For the first two cases we actually prove the stronger results:
  $\bullet$ There are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, paw$+P_1$)-free graphs for all $k$ and that only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, paw$+P_1$)-free graphs for all $k\ge 1$.
  $\bullet$ There are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $P_5$, $P_3+cP_2$)-free graphs for all $k\ge 1$ and $c\ge 0$.
  To prove the latter result, we employ a novel application of Sperner's Theorem on the number of antichains in a partially ordered set. Our result for $K_4$ uses exhaustive computer search and is proved by showing the stronger result that every $(\text{co-gem, }K_4)$-free graph is $4$-colourable. Our results imply the existence of simple polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide the $k$-colourability of (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ and all $H$ of order $4$ by searching the vertex-critical graphs as induced subgraphs.</description>
