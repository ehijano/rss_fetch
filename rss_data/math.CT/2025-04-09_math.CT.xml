      <title>Categorical matrix factorizations and monomorphism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article generalizes the correspondence between matrix factorizations and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over hypersurface rings due to Eisenbud and Yoshino. We consider factorizations with several factors in a purely categorical context, extending results of Sun and Zhang for Gorenstein projective module factorizations. Our formulation relies on a notion of hypersurface category and replaces Gorenstein projectives by objects of general Frobenius exact subcategories. We show that factorizations over such categories form again a Frobenius category. Our main result is then a triangle equivalence between the stable category of factorizations and that of chains of monomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Day algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Day monoidal product generalises in a straightforward way to other algebraic constructions and partial algebraic constructions on categories. This generalisation was motivated by its applications in logic, for example in hybrid and separation logic. We use the description of the Day monoidal product using profunctors to show that the definition generalises to an extension of an arbitrary algebraic structure on a category to a pseudo-algebraic structure on a functor category. We provide two further extensions. First we consider the case where some of the operations on the category are partial, and second we show that the resulting operations on the functor category have adjoints (they are residuated).</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Double of Hopf Algebras Realized via Partial Dualization and the Tensor Category of Its Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the (generalized) quantum double $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ determined by a (skew) pairing between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}$ and $H$, especially the tensor category $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ of its finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we show that $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ is a left partially dualized (quasi-)Hopf algebra of $K^\mathrm{op}\otimes H$, and use this formulation to establish tensor equivalences from $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ to the categories ${}^K_K\mathcal{M}^K_H$ and ${}^{K^\ast}_{K^\ast}\mathcal{M}^{H^\ast}_{K^\ast}$ of two-sided two-cosided relative Hopf modules, as well as the category ${}_H\mathfrak{YD}^K$ of relative Yetter-Drinfeld modules.</description>

      <title>Homotopy coherent companionships and conjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that companionships and conjunctions in double $\infty$-categories -- and more generally, in double Segal spaces -- extend to functors out of the free-living companionship and conjunction respectively. Specifically, we prove that these extensions are (homotopically) unique: the corresponding spaces of extensions are contractible under suitable completeness assumptions. The developed theory is then put to use to give a characterization of companions and conjoints in functor double Segal spaces in terms of so-called companionable and conjointable 2-cells. We end with an application of our results to $(\infty,2)$-category theory.</description>

      <title>Towards the quantum exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs, the quantum exceptional relation, that specializes to a skein relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint representation). If a slight strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at least as a power series near $q=1$. The single quantum exceptional relation can be viewed as a deformation of the Jacobi relation, and implies a deformation of the Vogel relation that motivated the conjecture on the classical exceptional series.
  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 6$, with dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute the matrix of inner products, and the quantum dimensions of idempotents. We use the skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional polynomial for many knots. In particular we determine (unconditionally) the values of the quantum polynomials for the exceptional Lie algebras on these knots. We can perform these computations for all links of Conway width less than $6$, which includes all prime knots with 12 or fewer crossings. Finally, we prove several specialization results relating our conjectural family to certain quantum group categories, and conjecture a number of exceptional analogues of level-rank duality.</description>
