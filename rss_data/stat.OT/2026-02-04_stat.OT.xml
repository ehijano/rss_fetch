      <title>Ten simple rules for teaching data science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teaching data science presents unique challenges and opportunities that cannot be fully addressed by simply borrowing pedagogical strategies from its parent disciplines of statistics and computer science. Here, we present ten simple rules for teaching data science, developed and refined by leading educators in the community and successfully applied in our own data science classrooms.</description>

      <title>Six-Minute Man Sander Eitrem 5:58.52 -- first man below the 6:00.00 barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Calgary, November 2005, Chad Hedrick was the first to skate the 5,000 m below 6:10. His world record time 6:09.68 was then beaten a week later, in Salt Lake City, by Sven Kramer's 6:08.78. Further top races and world records followed over the ensuing seasons; up to and including the 2024-2025 season, a total of 126 races have been below 6:10, with Nils van der Poel's 2021 world record being 6:01.56. The appropriately hyped-up canonical question for the friends and followers and aficionados of speedskating has then been when (and by whom  we for the first time would witness a below 6:00.00 race. In this note I first use extreme value statistics modelling to assess the state of affairs, as per the end of the 2024-2025 season, with predictions and probabilities for the 2025-2026 season. Under natural modelling assumptions the probability of seeing a new world record during this new season is shown to be about ten percent. We were indeed excited but in reality merely modestly surprised that a race better than van der Poel's record was clocked, by Timothy Loubineaud, in Salt Lake City, November 14, 2025. But Six-Minute Man Sander Eitrem's outstanding 5:58.52 in Inzell, on January 24, 2026, is truly beamonesquely shocking. I also use the modelling machinery to analyse the post-Eitrem situation, and suggest answers to the question of how fast the 5,000 m ever can be skated.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Causal Effects Using Proxies of a Latent Interference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network interference occurs when treatments assigned to some units affect the outcomes of others. Traditional approaches often assume that the observed network correctly specifies the interference structure. However, in practice, researchers frequently only have access to proxy measurements of the interference network due to limitations in data collection or potential mismatches between measured networks and actual interference pathways. In this paper, we introduce a framework for estimating causal effects when only proxy networks are available. Our approach leverages a structural causal model that accommodates diverse proxy types, including noisy measurements, multiple data sources, and multilayer networks, and defines causal effects as interventions on population-level treatments. The latent nature of the true interference network poses significant challenges. To overcome them, we develop a Bayesian inference framework. We propose a Block Gibbs sampler with Locally Informed Proposals to update the latent network, thereby efficiently exploring the high-dimensional posterior space composed of both discrete and continuous parameters. The latent network updates are driven by information from the proxy networks, treatments, and outcomes. We illustrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering causal effects even when only proxies of the interference network are available.</description>
