      <title>Improved Patch Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a time-efficient approach to quantitative MRI, enabling the mapping of multiple tissue properties from a single, accelerated scan. However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Resolution: A Simulation Study and Sensitivity Analysis of System Parameters for Resourcesat-3S/3SA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resourcesat-3S/3SA, an upcoming Indian satellite, is designed with Aft and Fore payloads capturing stereo images at look angles of -5deg and 26deg, respectively. Operating at 632.6 km altitude, it features a panchromatic (PAN) band offering a Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 1.25 meters and a 60 km swath. To balance swath width and resolution, an Instantaneous Geometric Field of View (IGFOV) of 2.5 meters is maintained while ensuring a 1.25-meter GSD both along and across track. Along-track sampling is achieved through precise timing, while across-track accuracy is ensured by using two staggered pixel arrays. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is enhanced through Time Delay and Integration (TDI), employing two five-stage subarrays spaced 80 {\mu}m apart along the track, with a 4 {\mu}m (0.5 pixel) stagger in the across-track direction to achieve 1.25-meter resolution. To further boost resolution, the satellite employs super-resolution (SR), combining multiple low-resolution captures using sub-pixel shifts to produce high-resolution images. This technique, effective when images contain aliased high-frequency details, reconstructs full-resolution imagery using phase information from multiple observations, and has been successfully applied in remote sensing missions like SPOT-5, SkySat, and DubaiSat-1. A Monte Carlo simulation explores the factors influencing the resolution in Resourcesat-3S/3SA, with sensitivity analysis highlighting key impacts. The simulation methodology is broadly applicable to other remote sensing missions, optimizing SR for enhanced image clarity and resolution in future satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Variable Resolution Sampling and Deep Learning Image Recovery for Accelerated Multi-Spectral MRI Near Metal Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a variable resolution (VR) sampling and deep learning reconstruction approach for multi-spectral MRI near metal implants, aiming to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality. Background: The rising use of metal implants has increased MRI scans affected by metal artifacts. Multi-spectral imaging (MSI) reduces these artifacts but sacrifices acquisition efficiency. Methods: This retrospective study on 1.5T MSI knee and hip data from patients with metal hardware used a novel spectral undersampling scheme to improve acquisition efficiency by ~40%. U-Net-based deep learning models were trained for reconstruction. Image quality was evaluated using SSIM, PSNR, and RESI metrics. Results: Deep learning reconstructions of undersampled VR data (DL-VR) showed significantly higher SSIM and PSNR values (p&lt;0.001) compared to conventional reconstruction (CR-VR), with improved edge sharpness. Edge sharpness in DL-reconstructed images matched fully sampled references (p=0.5). Conclusion: This approach can potentially enhance MRI examinations near metal implants by reducing scan times or enabling higher resolution. Further prospective studies are needed to assess clinical value.</description>

      <title>NCAdapt: Dynamic adaptation with domain-specific Neural Cellular Automata for continual hippocampus segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in medical imaging presents a unique challenge, requiring models to adapt to new domains while retaining previously acquired knowledge. We introduce NCAdapt, a Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) based method designed to address this challenge. NCAdapt features a domain-specific multi-head structure, integrating adaptable convolutional layers into the NCA backbone for each new domain encountered. After initial training, the NCA backbone is frozen, and only the newly added adaptable convolutional layers, consisting of 384 parameters, are trained along with domain-specific NCA convolutions. We evaluate NCAdapt on hippocampus segmentation tasks, benchmarking its performance against Lifelong nnU-Net and U-Net models with state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods. Our lightweight approach achieves SOTA performance, underscoring its effectiveness in addressing CL challenges in medical imaging. Upon acceptance, we will make our code base publicly accessible to support reproducibility and foster further advancements in medical CL.</description>

      <title>MS-Glance: Non-semantic context vectors and the applications in supervising image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-semantic context information is crucial for visual recognition, as the human visual perception system first uses global statistics to process scenes rapidly before identifying specific objects. However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Z7Gao/MSGlance}.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network for PET Image Denoising: Multi-Dimensional Validation on Large Datasets with Reader Study and Real Low-Dose Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical tool for diagnosing tumors and neurological disorders but poses radiation risks to patients, particularly to sensitive populations. While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Novel Clinical-Grade Prostate Cancer Detection and Grading Model: Development and Prospective Validation Using Real World Data, with Performance Assessment on IHC Requested Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence may assist healthcare systems in meeting increasing demand for pathology services while maintaining diagnostic quality and reducing turnaround time and costs. We aimed to investigate the performance of an institutionally developed system for prostate cancer detection, grading, and workflow optimization and to contrast this with commercial alternatives. From August 2021 to March 2023, we scanned 21,396 slides from 1,147 patients with positive biopsies. We developed models for cancer detection, grading, and screening of equivocal cases for IHC ordering. We compared a task-specific model trained using the PANDA dataset of prostate cancer biopsies with one built using features extracted by the general-purpose histology foundation model, UNI and compare their performance in an unfiltered prospectively collected dataset that reflects our patient population (1737 slides,95 patients). We evaluated the contributions of a bespoke model designed to improve sensitivity in detecting small cancer foci and scoring of broader patterns observed at lower resolution. We found high concordance between the developed systems and pathologist reference in detection (AUC 98.5, sensitivity 95.0, and specificity 97.8), ISUP grading (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0.869), grade group 3 or higher (AUC 97.5, sensitivity 94.9, specificity 96.6) and comparable to published data from commercial systems. Screening could reduce IHC ordering for equivocal cases by 44.5% with an overall error rate of 1.8% (1.4% false positive, 0.4% false negative rates). Institutions like academic medical centers that have high scanning volumes and report abstraction capabilities can develop accurate computational pathology models for internal use. These models have the potential to aid in quality control role and to improve workflow in the pathology lab to help meet future challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>MLLA-UNet: Mamba-like Linear Attention in an Efficient U-Shape Model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in medical imaging have resulted in more complex and diverse images, with challenges such as high anatomical variability, blurred tissue boundaries, low organ contrast, and noise. Traditional segmentation methods struggle to address these challenges, making deep learning approaches, particularly U-shaped architectures, increasingly prominent. However, the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention makes Transformers computationally prohibitive for high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose MLLA-UNet (Mamba-Like Linear Attention UNet), a novel architecture that achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining high segmentation accuracy through its innovative combination of linear attention and Mamba-inspired adaptive mechanisms, complemented by an efficient symmetric sampling structure for enhanced feature processing. Our architecture effectively preserves essential spatial features while capturing long-range dependencies at reduced computational complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for multi-scale feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate that MLLA-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on six challenging datasets with 24 different segmentation tasks, including but not limited to FLARE22, AMOS CT, and ACDC, with an average DSC of 88.32%. These results underscore the superiority of MLLA-UNet over existing methods. Our contributions include the novel 2D segmentation architecture and its empirical validation.

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Models for Anomaly Localization in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores anomaly localization in medical images using denoising diffusion models. After providing a brief methodological background of these models, including their application to image reconstruction and their conditioning using guidance mechanisms, we provide an overview of available datasets and evaluation metrics suitable for their application to anomaly localization in medical images. In this context, we discuss supervision schemes ranging from fully supervised segmentation to semi-supervised, weakly supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised methods, and provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of these approaches. Furthermore, we highlight open challenges in anomaly localization, including detection bias, domain shift, computational cost, and model interpretability. Our goal is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in the field, outline research gaps, and highlight the potential of diffusion models for robust anomaly localization in medical images.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual MRI Data Augmentation using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models in medical imaging face challenges in generalizability and robustness due to variations in image acquisition parameters (IAP). In this work, we introduce a novel method using conditional denoising diffusion generative models (cDDGMs) to generate counterfactual magnetic resonance (MR) images that simulate different IAP without altering patient anatomy. We demonstrate that using these counterfactual images for data augmentation can improve segmentation accuracy, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, enhancing the overall generalizability and robustness of DL models across diverse imaging conditions. Our approach shows promise in addressing domain and covariate shifts in medical imaging. The code is publicly available at https: //github.com/pedromorao/Counterfactual-MRI-Data-Augmentation</description>

      <title>Temporal and Spatial Super Resolution with Latent Diffusion Model in Medical MRI images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Code link is also shared.</description>

      <title>UAV-based detection of landmines using infrared thermography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landmines remain a pervasive threat in conflict-affected regions worldwide, exacting a toll on innocent lives. Shockingly, every 95 minutes, another individual becomes a victim of these lethal explosive devices (Landmines Monitor 2022 2022), with a significant proportion being innocent civilians. Current methods for landmine detection suffer from inefficiency, high costs, and risks to the operator and system integrity. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, safe, and cost-effective approach to unearth these hidden dangers. Our proposed method integrates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a thermal camera to capture high-resolution images of minefields. These images are subsequently transmitted to a base computer, where a state-of-the-art image processing algorithm is applied to identify the presence of landmines. Notably, our solution performs exceptionally well, particularly during evening hours, achieving an impressive detection accuracy of nearly 88%. These results exhibit great promise when compared to existing methods constrained by their design limitations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Efficacy of Classical and Deep Neuroimaging Biomarkers in Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and its early detection is crucial for effective intervention, yet current diagnostic methods often fall short in sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to detect significant indicators of early AD by extracting and integrating various imaging biomarkers, including radiomics, hippocampal texture descriptors, cortical thickness measurements, and deep learning features. We analyze structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts, utilizing comprehensive image analysis and machine learning techniques. Our results show that combining multiple biomarkers significantly improves detection accuracy. Radiomics and texture features emerged as the most effective predictors for early AD, achieving AUCs of 0.88 and 0.72 for AD and MCI detection, respectively. Although deep learning features proved to be less effective than traditional approaches, incorporating age with other biomarkers notably enhanced MCI detection performance. Additionally, our findings emphasize the continued importance of classical imaging biomarkers in the face of modern deep-learning approaches, providing a robust framework for early AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning with HM-VGG: AI Strategies for Multi-modal Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Hybrid Multi-modal VGG (HM-VGG) model, a cutting-edge deep learning approach for the early diagnosis of glaucoma. The HM-VGG model utilizes an attention mechanism to process Visual Field (VF) data, enabling the extraction of key features that are vital for identifying early signs of glaucoma. Despite the common reliance on large annotated datasets, the HM-VGG model excels in scenarios with limited data, achieving remarkable results with small sample sizes. The model's performance is underscored by its high metrics in Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score, indicating its potential for real-world application in glaucoma detection. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with ophthalmic image analysis, particularly the difficulty of obtaining large volumes of annotated data. It highlights the importance of moving beyond single-modality data, such as VF or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images alone, to a multimodal approach that can provide a richer, more comprehensive dataset. This integration of different data types is shown to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. The HM- VGG model offers a promising tool for doctors, streamlining the diagnostic process and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, its applicability extends to telemedicine and mobile healthcare, making diagnostic services more accessible. The research presented in this paper is a significant step forward in the field of medical image processing and has profound implications for clinical ophthalmology.</description>

      <title>Parameter choices in HaarPSI for IQA with medical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When developing machine learning models, image quality assessment (IQA) measures are a crucial component for evaluation. However, commonly used IQA measures have been primarily developed and optimized for natural images. In many specialized settings, such as medical images, this poses an often-overlooked problem regarding suitability. In previous studies, the IQA measure HaarPSI showed promising behavior for natural and medical images. HaarPSI is based on Haar wavelet representations and the framework allows optimization of two parameters. So far, these parameters have been aligned for natural images. Here, we optimize these parameters for two annotated medical data sets, a photoacoustic and a chest X-Ray data set. We observe that they are more sensitive to the parameter choices than the employed natural images, and on the other hand both medical data sets lead to similar parameter values when optimized. We denote the optimized setting, which improves the performance for the medical images notably, by HaarPSI$_{MED}$. The results suggest that adapting common IQA measures within their frameworks for medical images can provide a valuable, generalizable addition to the employment of more specific task-based measures.</description>

      <title>Ensemble learning of the atrial fiber orientation with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic structure of the myocardium is a key determinant of the cardiac function. To date, there is no imaging modality to assess in-vivo the cardiac fiber structure. We recently proposed Fibernet, a method for the automatic identification of the anisotropic conduction -- and thus fibers -- in the atria from local electrical recordings. Fibernet uses cardiac activation as recorded during electroanatomical mappings to infer local conduction properties using physics-informed neural networks. In this work, we extend Fibernet to cope with the uncertainty in the estimated fiber field. Specifically, we use an ensemble of neural networks to produce multiple samples, all fitting the observed data, and compute posterior statistics. We also introduce a methodology to select the best fiber orientation members and define the input of the neural networks directly on the atrial surface. With these improvements, we outperform the previous methodology in terms of fiber orientation error in 8 different atrial anatomies. Currently, our approach can estimate the fiber orientation and conduction velocities in under 7 minutes with quantified uncertainty, which opens the door to its application in clinical practice. We hope the proposed methodology will enable further personalization of cardiac digital twins for precision medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently developed new approach, called ``Empirical Wavelet Transform'', aims to build 1D adaptive wavelet frames accordingly to the analyzed signal. In this paper, we present several extensions of this approach to 2D signals (images). We revisit some well-known transforms (tensor wavelets, Littlewood-Paley wavelets, ridgelets and curvelets) and show that it is possible to build their empirical counterpart. We prove that such constructions lead to different adaptive frames which show some promising properties for image analysis and processing.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>HoloChrome: Polychromatic Illumination for Speckle Reduction in Holographic Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic displays hold the promise of providing authentic depth cues, resulting in enhanced immersive visual experiences for near-eye applications. However, current holographic displays are hindered by speckle noise, which limits accurate reproduction of color and texture in displayed images. We present HoloChrome, a polychromatic holographic display framework designed to mitigate these limitations. HoloChrome utilizes an ultrafast, wavelength-adjustable laser and a dual-Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) architecture, enabling the multiplexing of a large set of discrete wavelengths across the visible spectrum. By leveraging spatial separation in our dual-SLM setup, we independently manipulate speckle patterns across multiple wavelengths. This novel approach effectively reduces speckle noise through incoherent averaging achieved by wavelength multiplexing. Our method is complementary to existing speckle reduction techniques, offering a new pathway to address this challenge. Furthermore, the use of polychromatic illumination broadens the achievable color gamut compared to traditional three-color primary holographic displays.
  Our simulations and tabletop experiments validate that HoloChrome significantly reduces speckle noise and expands the color gamut. These advancements enhance the performance of holographic near-eye displays, moving us closer to practical, immersive next-generation visual experiences.</description>

      <title>Subjective performance evaluation of bitrate allocation strategies for MPEG and JPEG Pleno point cloud compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rise in interest in point clouds as an imaging modality has motivated standardization groups such as MPEG and JPEG Pleno to launch activities aiming at developing compression standards for point clouds. Lossy compression usually introduces visual artifacts that negatively impact the perceived quality of media, which can only be reliably measured through subjective visual quality assessment experiments. While MPEG standards have been subjectively evaluated in previous studies on multiple occasions, no work has yet assessed the performance of the recent JPEG Pleno standard in comparison to them. In this study, a comprehensive performance evaluation of MPEG and JPEG Pleno standards for point cloud compression is conducted. The impact of different configuration parameters on the performance of the codecs is first analyzed with the help of objective quality metrics. The results from this analysis are used to define three rate allocation strategies for each codec, which are employed to compress a set of point clouds at four target rates. The set of distorted point clouds is then subjectively evaluated following two subjective quality assessment protocols. Finally, the obtained results are used to compare the performance of these compression standards and draw insights about best coding practices.</description>

      <title>Assessing objective quality metrics for JPEG and MPEG point cloud coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As applications using immersive media gained increased attention from both academia and industry, research in the field of point cloud compression has greatly intensified in recent years, leading to the development of the MPEG compression standards V-PCC and G-PCC, as well as the more recent JPEG Pleno learning-based point cloud coding. Each of the standards mentioned above is based on a different algorithm, introducing distinct types of degradation that may impair the quality of experience when lossy compression is applied. Although the impact on perceptual quality can be accurately evaluated during subjective quality assessment experiments, objective quality metrics also predict the visually perceived quality and provide similarity scores without human intervention. Nevertheless, their accuracy can be susceptible to the characteristics of the evaluated media as well as to the type and intensity of the added distortion. While the performance of multiple state-of-the-art objective quality metrics has already been evaluated through their correlation with subjective scores obtained in the presence of artifacts produced by the MPEG standards, no study has evaluated how metrics perform with the more recent JPEG Pleno point cloud coding. In this paper, a study is conducted to benchmark the performance of a large set of objective quality metrics in a subjective dataset including distortions produced by JPEG and MPEG codecs. The dataset also contains three different trade-offs between color and geometry compression for each codec, adding another dimension to the analysis. Performance indexes are computed over the entire dataset but also after splitting according to the codec and to the original model, resulting in detailed insights about the overall performance of each visual quality predictor as well as their cross-content and cross-codec generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Eddeep: Fast eddy-current distortion correction for diffusion MRI with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.</description>

      <title>SR-CACO-2: A Dataset for Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confocal fluorescence microscopy is one of the most accessible and widely used imaging techniques for the study of biological processes at the cellular and subcellular levels. Scanning confocal microscopy allows the capture of high-quality images from thick three-dimensional (3D) samples, yet suffers from well-known limitations such as photobleaching and phototoxicity of specimens caused by intense light exposure, limiting its applications. Cellular damage can be alleviated by changing imaging parameters to reduce light exposure, often at the expense of image quality. Machine/deep learning methods for single-image super-resolution (SISR) can be applied to restore image quality by upscaling lower-resolution (LR) images to yield high-resolution images (HR). These SISR methods have been successfully applied to photo-realistic images due partly to the abundance of publicly available data. In contrast, the lack of publicly available data partly limits their application and success in scanning confocal microscopy. In this paper, we introduce a large scanning confocal microscopy dataset named SR-CACO-2 that is comprised of low- and high-resolution image pairs marked for three different fluorescent markers. It allows the evaluation of performance of SISR methods on three different upscaling levels (X2, X4, X8). SR-CACO-2 contains the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), and it is composed of 2,200 unique images, captured with four resolutions and three markers, forming 9,937 image patches for SISR methods. We provide benchmarking results for 16 state-of-the-art methods of the main SISR families. Results show that these methods have limited success in producing high-resolution textures. The dataset is freely accessible under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). Our dataset, code and pretrained weights for SISR methods are available: https://github.com/sbelharbi/sr-caco-2.</description>

Abstract: Medical imaging analysis faces challenges such as data scarcity, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. This paper introduces the Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging (MAISI), an innovative approach using the diffusion model to generate synthetic 3D computed tomography (CT) images to address those challenges. MAISI leverages the foundation volume compression network and the latent diffusion model to produce high-resolution CT images (up to a landmark volume dimension of 512 x 512 x 768 ) with flexible volume dimensions and voxel spacing. By incorporating ControlNet, MAISI can process organ segmentation, including 127 anatomical structures, as additional conditions and enables the generation of accurately annotated synthetic images that can be used for various downstream tasks. Our experiment results show that MAISI's capabilities in generating realistic, anatomically accurate images for diverse regions and conditions reveal its promising potential to mitigate challenges using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>MambaEviScrib: Mamba and Evidence-Guided Consistency Enhance CNN Robustness for Scribble-Based Weakly Supervised Ultrasound Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures and lesions from ultrasound images contributes to disease assessment. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on sparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the potential to reduce annotation costs. This study attempts to introduce scribble-based WSL into ultrasound image segmentation tasks. However, ultrasound images often suffer from poor contrast and unclear edges, coupled with insufficient supervison signals for edges, posing challenges to edge prediction. Uncertainty modeling has been proven to facilitate models in dealing with these issues. Nevertheless, existing uncertainty estimation paradigms are not robust enough and often filter out predictions near decision boundaries, resulting in unstable edge predictions. Therefore, we propose leveraging predictions near decision boundaries effectively. Specifically, we introduce Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence to design an Evidence-Guided Consistency strategy. This strategy utilizes high-evidence predictions, which are more likely to occur near high-density regions, to guide the optimization of low-evidence predictions that may appear near decision boundaries. Furthermore, the diverse sizes and locations of lesions in ultrasound images pose a challenge for CNNs with local receptive fields, as they struggle to model global information. Therefore, we introduce Visual Mamba based on structured state space sequence models, which achieves long-range dependency with linear computational complexity, and we construct a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba framework. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the Mamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based on the EGC strategy. Experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. Dataset and code will be available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/MambaEviScrib.</description>

      <title>Mind the Context: Attention-Guided Weak-to-Strong Consistency for Enhanced Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal step in diagnostic and therapeutic processes, relying on high-quality annotated data that is often challenging and costly to obtain. Semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to enhance model performance by leveraging unlabeled data. Although weak-to-strong consistency is a prevalent method in semi-supervised image segmentation, there is a scarcity of research on perturbation strategies specifically tailored for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a simple yet efficient semi-supervised learning framework named Attention-Guided weak-to-strong Consistency Match (AIGCMatch). The AIGCMatch framework incorporates attention-guided perturbation strategies at both the image and feature levels to achieve weak-to-strong consistency regularization. This method not only preserves the structural information of medical images but also enhances the model's ability to process complex semantic information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ACDC and ISIC-2017 datasets have validated the effectiveness of AIGCMatch. Our method achieved a 90.4\% Dice score in the 7-case scenario on the ACDC dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its potential and efficacy in clinical settings. Additionally, on the ISIC-2017 dataset, we significantly outperformed our baseline, indicating the robustness and generalizability of AIGCMatch across different medical image segmentation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Medical images often incorporate doctor-added markers that can hinder AI-based diagnosis. This issue highlights the need of inpainting techniques to restore the corrupted visual contents. However, existing methods require manual mask annotation as input, limiting the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel blind inpainting method that automatically reconstructs visual contents within the corrupted regions without mask input as guidance. Our model includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for adversarial training. The reconstruction network contains two branches that predict corrupted regions in images and simultaneously restore the missing visual contents. Leveraging the potent recognition capability of a dense object detector, the object-aware discriminator ensures markers undetectable after inpainting. Thus, the restored images closely resemble the clean ones. We evaluate our method on three datasets of various medical imaging modalities, confirming better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: To enable safe and effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) in smart manufacturing, seamless integration of sensing, cognition, and prediction into the robot controller is critical for real-time awareness, response, and communication inside a heterogeneous environment (robots, humans, and equipment). The proposed approach takes advantage of the prediction capabilities of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to execute a safe path planning based on feedback from a vision system. In order to satisfy the requirement of real-time path planning, an embedded solver based on a penalty method is applied. However, due to tight sampling times NMPC solutions are approximate, and hence the safety of the system cannot be guaranteed. To address this we formulate a novel safety-critical paradigm with an exponential control barrier function (ECBF) used as a safety filter. We also design a simple human-robot collaboration scenario using V-REP to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller and investigate whether integrating human pose prediction can help with safe and efficient collaboration. The robot uses OptiTrack cameras for perception and dynamically generates collision-free trajectories to the predicted target interactive position. Results for a number of different configurations confirm the efficiency of the proposed motion planning and execution framework. It yields a 19.8% reduction in execution time for the HRC task considered.</description>

      <title>NM-FlowGAN: Modeling sRGB Noise without Paired Images using a Hybrid Approach of Normalizing Flows and GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10112</link>

Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise modeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network leverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise characteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial correlation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships. In particular, unlike recent methods that rely on paired noisy images, our method synthesizes noise using clean images and factors that affect noise characteristics, such as easily obtainable parameters like camera type and ISO settings, making it applicable to various fields where obtaining noisy-clean image pairs is not feasible. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines in the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network trained with synthesized image pairs from our model shows superior performance compared to other baselines.
