      <title>From Chaos to Coherence: Effects of High-Order Synaptic Correlations on Neural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics, and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. The change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.</description>

      <title>More variable circadian rhythms in epilepsy captured by long-term heart rate recordings from wearable sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: The circadian rhythm synchronizes physiological and behavioural patterns with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. Disruption to the circadian rhythm is linked to various health conditions, though optimal methods to describe these disruptions remain unclear. An emerging approach is to examine the intra-individual variability in measurable properties of the circadian rhythm over extended periods. Epileptic seizures are modulated by circadian rhythms, but the relevance of circadian rhythm disruption in epilepsy remains unexplored. Our study investigates intra-individual circadian variability in epilepsy and its relationship with seizures.
  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed over 70,000 hours of wearable smartwatch data (Fitbit) from 143 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 31 healthy controls. Circadian oscillations in heart rate time series were extracted, daily estimates of circadian period, acrophase, and amplitude properties were produced, and estimates of the intra-individual variability of these properties over an entire recording were calculated.
  Results: PWE exhibited greater intra-individual variability in period (76 min vs. 57 min, d=0.66, p&lt;0.001) and acrophase (64 min vs. 48 min, d=0.49, p=0.004) compared to controls, but not in amplitude (2 bpm, d=-0.15, p=0.49). Variability in circadian properties showed no correlation with seizure frequency, nor any differences between weeks with and without seizures.
  Significance: For the first time, we show that heart rate circadian rhythms are more variable in PWE, detectable via consumer wearable devices. However, no association with seizure frequency or occurrence was found, suggesting that this variability might be underpinned by the epilepsy aetiology rather than being a seizure-driven effect.</description>

      <title>GyralNet Subnetwork Partitioning via Differentiable Spectral Modularity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain requires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark. GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.</description>

      <title>Orientation selectivity properties for integrated affine quasi quadrature models of complex cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the orientation selectivity properties of idealized models of complex cells in terms of affine quasi quadrature measures, which combine the responses of idealized models of simple cells in terms of affine Gaussian derivatives by (i) pointwise squaring, (ii) summation of responses for different orders of spatial derivation and (iii) spatial integration. Specifically, this paper explores the consequences of assuming that the family of spatial receptive fields should be covariant under spatial affine transformations, thereby implying that the receptive fields ought to span a variability over the degree of elongation.
  We investigate the theoretical properties of three main ways of defining idealized models of complex cells and compare the predictions from these models to neurophysiologically obtained receptive field histograms over the resultant of biological orientation selectivity curves. It is shown that the extended modelling mechanism lead to more uniform behaviour and a wider span over the values of the resultat that are covered, compared to earlier presented idealized models of complex cells without spatial integration. More generally, we propose that the presented methodology could be used as a new tool to evaluate other computational models of complex cells in relation to biological measurements.</description>

      <title>How to set up a psychedelic study: Unique considerations for research involving human participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Setting up a psychedelic study can be a long, arduous, and kafkaesque process. This rapidly-developing field poses several unique challenges for researchers, necessitating a range of considerations that have not yet been standardised. Many of the complexities inherent to psychedelic research also challenge existing assumptions around, for example, approaches to psychiatric prescribing, the conceptual framing of the placebo effect, and definitions of selfhood. This review paper brings together several of the major psychedelic research teams across the United Kingdom to formalise these unique considerations, identify continuing areas of debate, and provide a practical, experience-based guide, with recommendations for policymakers and future researchers intending to set up a psychedelic research study or clinical trial. We approach this such that the paper can either be read end to end, or treated as a manual: readers can dip into relevant sections as needed.</description>

      <title>Dense networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: Spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit. While this is known, a general question has remained unanswered: does synaptic weight scaling suffices, by itself, to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be homogeneous or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits, or graphons, we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to reinterpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries for mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons. Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable, remain fixed-parameter intractable relative to model/circuit features, and inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability or fixed-parameter tractability of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands on existing and future architectures.</description>
