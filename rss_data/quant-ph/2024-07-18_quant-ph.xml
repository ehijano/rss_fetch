      <title>Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian States and How to Measure It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of non-classicality of continuous variable states using moments of Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: States with negative Wigner function, a significant subclass of non-classical states, serve as a valuable resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Here, we provide a criterion for detecting such quantum states exhibiting negative Wigner function. Our method relies on evaluating moments of the Wigner function which involves computing simple functionals and can be implemented in a real experiment without the need for full state tomography or Wigner function reconstruction. We then provide explicit examples to support our detection scheme. Further, we propose an experimental method utilizing the continuous variable SWAP operator to realize these moments in a real experiment.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to light-matter interaction: Bridging quantum and semiclassical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent variational approach with the multiple Davydov $D_2$ trial state to simulate the dynamics of light-matter systems when the field is in a coherent state with an arbitrary finite mean photon number. The variational approach captures not only the system dynamics but also the field dynamics and is applicable to a variety of quantum models of light-matter interaction such as the Jaynes-Cummings model, Rabi model, and Dicke model, and is feasible to tackle the multimode quantized fields. By comparison of the variational and semiclassical dynamics of both the system and field, we illustrate that the variational dynamics from the quantum models agrees with those from the corresponding semiclassical models as long as the mean number of photons is sufficiently large. Moreover, we illustrate that in the crossover between the quantum and semiclassical limits, the quantum corrections lead to the collapse of the oscillations in dynamics, which is absent in the semiclassical models. The variational approach provides a unified treatment of light-matter interaction from the quantum to the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Parameter Generation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12242v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a compelling prospect for revolutionizing the field of combinatorial optimization, in virtue of the unique attributes of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, stands out as leading proposals to efficiently solve the Max-Cut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its promised advantages strongly rely on parameters initialization strategy, a critical aspect due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by low-quality local minima issues. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task in which the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to generate high-performing initial parameters for QAOA. The diffusion model is capable of learning the distribution of high-performing parameters and then synthesizing new parameters closer to optimal ones. Experiments with various sized Max-Cut problem instances demonstrate that our diffusion process consistently enhances QAOA effectiveness compared to random parameters initialization. Moreover, our framework indicates the capacity of training on small, classically simulatable problem instances, aiming at extrapolating to larger instances to reduce quantum computational resource overhead.</description>

      <title>Strong cubic phase shifts on the photonic vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addition of photons to coherent states is shown to produce effects that display remarkable similarities with cubic phase shifts acting on the vacuum state, with recorded fidelities in excess of 90 percent. The strength of the cubic interaction is found to vary inversely with the displacement of the coherent state and the strongest interactions were one order of magnitude greater than previous observations. The interaction is non-perturbative.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping through the Liouvillian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect describes the boundary affinity of Liouvillian eignemodes that originates from the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of the Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamically, it manifests as directional flow in the transient dynamics, and the accumulation of population near open boundaries at long times. Intriguingly, similar dynamic phenomena exist in the well-known process of optical pumping, where the system is driven into a desired state (or a dark-state subspace) through the interplay of dissipation and optical drive. In this work, we show that typical optical pumping processes can indeed be understood in terms of the Liouvillian skin effect. By studying the Liouvillian spectra under different boundary conditions, we reveal that the Liouvillian spectra of the driven-dissipative pumping process sensitively depend on the boundary conditions in the state space, a signature that lies at the origin of the Liouvillian skin effect. Such a connection provides insights and practical means for designing efficient optical-pumping schemes through engineering Liouvillian gaps under the open-boundary condition. Based on these understandings, we show that the efficiency of a typical side-band cooling scheme for trapped ions can be dramatically enhanced by introducing counterintuitive dissipative channels. Our results provide a useful perspective for optical pumping, with interesting implications for state preparation and cooling.</description>

      <title>SHARC-VQE: Simplified Hamiltonian Approach with Refinement and Correction enabled Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the Partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from $O(\frac{N^4}{\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ for a system of $N$ qubits and accuracy $\epsilon$, while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from $O(\frac{N^7}{\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\frac{N^3}{\epsilon^2})$. Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20-40% to 5-10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. Additionally, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking adiabatic transformation by alternating unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic transformation can be approximated as alternating unitary operators of a Hamiltonian and its parameter derivative as proposed in a gate-based approach to counterdiabatic driving (van Vreumingen, arXiv:2406.08064). In this paper, we conduct numerical benchmarking of this alternating unitary method in a finite-parameter range against adiabatic driving in nonadiabatic timescale. We find that the alternating unitary method results in broader distribution on energy eigenstates than that obtained by adiabatic driving, but it has ability to sample low-energy eigenstates when an energy gap of a given Hamiltonian is small. It indicates that the alternating unitary method may be able to find good approximate solutions in quantum annealing applied to hard instances.</description>

      <title>Improved Nonlocality Certification via Bouncing between Bell Operators and Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is an intrinsic feature of quantum mechanics, which can be certified via the violation of Bell inequalities. It is therefore a fundamental question to certify Bell nonlocality from experimental data. Here, we present an optimization scheme to improve nonlocality certification by exploring flexible mappings between Bell inequalities and Hamiltonians corresponding to the Bell operators. We show that several Hamiltonian models can be mapped to new inequalities with improved classical bounds than the original one, enabling a more robust detection of nonlocality. From the other direction, we investigate the mapping from fixed Bell inequalities to Hamiltonians, aiming to maximize quantum violations while considering experimental imperfections. As a practical demonstration, we apply this method to an XXZ-like honeycomb-lattice model utilizing over 70 superconducting qubits. The successful application of this technique, as well as combining the two directions to form an optimization loop, may open new avenues for developing more practical and noise-resilient nonlocality certification techniques and enable broader experimental explorations.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability function, defined as the optimal error exponent describing the exponential decay of decoding error probability when the communicating rate is below the capacity of the channel, is one of the fundamental problems in information theory. In this work, we determine the reliability function for a general cq channel. The main contribution is a lower bound for the error exponent which is characterised by the Renyi divergence in Petz's form. It turns out that the lower bound matches the upper bound given by Dalai (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 46, 2256 (2000)) when the rate is not very low. Thus the reliability function is obtained by combining these two bounds in a proper range of communicating rate. The approach to derive the lower bound makes use of tricks on types and an observation by Renes (arXiv: 2207.08899) that channel code can be constructed from data compression scheme for uniform distribution relative to side information, whose solution to the error exponent problem is in turn determined by its dual problem -- privacy amplification, for which the exact error exponent is known.</description>

      <title>Comparison of estimation limits for quantum two-parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement estimation bounds for local quantum multiparameter estimation, which provide lower bounds on possible measurement uncertainties, have so far been formulated in two ways: by extending the classical Cram\'er--Rao bound (e.g., the quantum Cram\'er--Rao bound and the Nagaoka Cram'er--Rao bound) and by incorporating the parameter estimation framework with the uncertainty principle, as in the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation. In this work, we present a general framework that allows a direct comparison between these different types of estimation limits. Specifically, we compare the attainability of the Nagaoka Cram\'er--Rao bound and the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation, using analytical and numerical techniques. We show that these two limits can provide different information about the physically attainable precision. We present an example where both limits provide the same attainable precision and an example where the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation is not attainable even for pure states. We further demonstrate that the unattainability in the latter case arises because the figure of merit underpinning the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation (the difference between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices) does not necessarily agree with the conventionally used figure of merit (mean squared error). The results offer insights into the general attainability and applicability of the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation. Furthermore, our proposed framework for comparing bounds of different types may prove useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Classification and reconstruction of images in the problem single-pixel imaging using classical and quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pixel cameras can be an excellent solution for light ranges outside the visible spectrum, combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. In the future of the development of quantum technologies, quantum computers can further speed up the solution of such problems. In this work we simulated a single-pixel detection experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6\% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images based on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed accuracies of 96\% and 95\% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite competitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity index values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

      <title>Emergence of second-order coherence in superfluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the second-order quantum coherence function of a superradiant burst in a cascaded quantum system. We chirally (i.e. direction-dependently) couple roughly 900 cesium atoms to the forward propagating mode of an optical nanofiber. We then prepare the ensemble in the maximally inverted state, where the subsequent collective emission of a burst is known as superfluorescence. Here, we observe that second-order coherence emerges in the course of the decay. This is a clear feature of the underlying collective dynamics that is also at the origin of the superradiant burst itself. We furthermore study the dynamics of the second-order coherence function of the emission in dependence on the initial average dipole moment of the ensemble. In addition, by correlating the detection of early and late photon emission events, we obtain evidence for fundamental shot-to-shot fluctuations in the delay of the start of the burst emission. Our findings reveal that, despite the fundamentally different coupling Hamiltonian, superradiance in cascaded and symmetrically coupled systems feature a strikingly large number of similarities.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of spontaneous symmetry breaking with emergent multi-qubit entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Demonstrations of SSB with quantum-mechanical characters have been observed in superradiant phase transitions with a single qubit coupled to a single photonic mode. We here propose and demonstrate SSB in the quantum phase transition of a multi-qubit system, governed by the competition between individual drivings and intra-qubit interactions. The quantum-mechanical SSB is manifested by the emergence of a multi-qubit cat state, formed by two degenerate symmetry-breaking eigenstates. We synthesize the theoretical model in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical features go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) modes are an important resource used in various branches of quantum science and technology due to their unique helical structure and countably infinite basis. Generating light that simultaneously carries high-order orbital angular momenta and exhibits quantum correlations is a challenging task. In this work, we present a theoretical approach to the generation of correlated Schmidt modes carrying OAM via parametric down-conversion (PDC) in cascaded nonlinear systems (nonlinear interferometers) pumped by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We demonstrate how the number of generated modes and their population can be controlled by varying the pump parameters, the gain of the PDC process and the distance between the crystals. We investigate the angular displacement sensitivity of these interferometers and demonstrate that it can overcome the classical shot noise limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points facilitate peculiar dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. Yet, in photonics, they have mainly been studied in the classical realm. In this work, we reveal the behavior of two-photon quantum states in non-Hermitian systems across the exceptional point. We probe the lossy directional coupler with an indistinguishable two-photon input state and observe distinct changes of the quantum correlations at the output as the system undergoes spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate a switching in the quantum interference of photons directly at the exceptional point, where Hong-Ou-Mandel dips are transformed into peaks by a change of basis. These results show that quantum interference and exceptional points are linked in curious ways that can now be further explored.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) have emerged as a valuable tool in the study of parameterized quantum circuits, helping to characterize both their expressiveness and trainability. In particular, the absence or presence of barren plateaus (BPs) -- flat regions in parameter space that prevent the efficient training of variational quantum algorithms -- has recently been shown to be intimately related to quantities derived from the associated DLA.
  In this work, we investigate DLAs for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most studied variational quantum algorithms for solving graph MaxCut and other combinatorial optimization problems. While DLAs for QAOA circuits have been studied before, existing results have either been based on numerical evidence, or else correspond to DLA generators specifically chosen to be universal for quantum computation on a subspace of states. We initiate an analytical study of barren plateaus and other statistics of QAOA algorithms, and give bounds on the dimensions of the corresponding DLAs and their centers for general graphs. We then focus on the $n$-vertex cycle and complete graphs. For the cycle graph we give an explicit basis, identify its decomposition into the direct sum of a $2$-dimensional center and a semisimple component isomorphic to $n-1$ copies of $su(2)$. We give an explicit basis for this isomorphism, and a closed-form expression for the variance of the cost function, proving the absence of BPs. For the complete graph we prove that the dimension of the DLA is $O(n^3)$ and give an explicit basis for the DLA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper examines state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques in quantum machine learning with potential applications in finance. We discuss QML techniques in supervised learning tasks, such as Quantum Variational Classifiers, Quantum Kernel Estimation, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), along with quantum generative AI techniques like Quantum Transformers and Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs). The financial applications considered include risk management, credit scoring, fraud detection, and stock price prediction. We also provide an overview of the challenges, potential, and limitations of QML, both in these specific areas and more broadly across the field. We hope that this can serve as a quick guide for data scientists, professionals in the financial sector, and enthusiasts in this area to understand why quantum computing and QML in particular could be interesting to explore in their field of expertise.</description>

      <title>Pulse-based variational quantum optimization and metalearning in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving optimization problems using variational algorithms stands out as a crucial application for noisy intermediate-scale devices. Instead of constructing gate-based quantum computers, our focus centers on designing variational quantum algorithms within the analog paradigm. This involves optimizing parameters that directly control pulses, driving quantum states towards target states without the necessity of compiling a quantum circuit. In this work, we introduce pulse-based variational quantum optimization (PBVQO) as a hardware-level framework. We illustrate the framework by optimizing external fluxes on superconducting quantum interference devices, effectively driving the wave function of this specific quantum architecture to the ground state of an encoded problem Hamiltonian. Given that the performance of variational algorithms heavily relies on appropriate initial parameters, we introduce a global optimizer as a meta-learning technique to tackle a simple problem. The synergy between PBVQO and meta-learning provides an advantage over conventional gate-based variational algorithms.</description>

      <title>Profiling quantum circuits for their efficient execution on single- and multi-core architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application-specific quantum computers offer the most efficient means to tackle problems intractable by classical computers. Realizing these architectures necessitates a deep understanding of quantum circuit properties and their relationship to execution outcomes on quantum devices. Our study aims to perform for the first time a rigorous examination of quantum circuits by introducing graph theory-based metrics extracted from their qubit interaction graph and gate dependency graph alongside conventional parameters describing the circuit itself. This methodology facilitates a comprehensive analysis and clustering of quantum circuits. Furthermore, it uncovers a connection between parameters rooted in both qubit interaction and gate dependency graphs, and the performance metrics for quantum circuit mapping, across a range of established quantum device and mapping configurations. Among the various device configurations, we particularly emphasize modular (i.e., multi-core) quantum computing architectures due to their high potential as a viable solution for quantum device scalability. This thorough analysis will help us to: i) identify key attributes of quantum circuits that affect the quantum circuit mapping performance metrics; ii) predict the performance on a specific chip for similar circuit structures; iii) determine preferable combinations of mapping techniques and hardware setups for specific circuits; and iv) define representative benchmark sets by clustering similarly structured circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we employ the Feynman path integral method to derive the propagator in one-dimensional Wigner-Dunkl quantum mechanics. To verify our findings we calculate the propagator associated with the free particle and the harmonic oscillator in the presence of the Dunkl derivative. We also deduce the energy spectra and the corresponding bound-state wave functions from the spectral decomposition of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Learning Gaussian Operations and the Matchgate Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning an unknown quantum process is a central task for validation of the functioning of near-term devices. The task is generally hard, requiring exponentially many measurements if no prior assumptions are made on the process. However, an interesting feature of the classically-simulable Clifford group is that unknown Clifford operations may be efficiently determined from a black-box implementation. We extend this result to the important class of fermionic Gaussian operations. These operations have received much attention due to their close links to fermionic linear optics. We then introduce an infinite family of unitary gates, called the Matchgate Hierarchy, with a similar structure to the Clifford Hierarchy. We show that the Clifford Hierarchy is contained within the Matchgate Hierarchy and how operations at any level of the hierarchy can be efficiently learned.</description>

      <title>Precision Quantum Parameter Inference with Continuous Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Parameter Estimation (QPE) is important from the perspective of both fundamental quantum research and various practical applications of quantum technologies such as for developing optimal quantum control strategies. Standard and traditional methods for QPE involve projective measurements on thousands of identically prepared quantum systems. However, these methods face limitations, particularly in terms of the required number of samples and the associated experimental resources. In this work, we present a novel method for precise QPE that diverges from conventional techniques, employs continuous measurements, and enables accurate QPE with a single quantum trajectory. In an application, we demonstrate the use of the method for the task of parameter estimation and force sensing of a levitated nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of Quantum Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Hidden time-reversal in driven XXZ spin chains: exact solutions and new dissipative phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that several models of interacting XXZ spin chains subject to boundary driving and dissipation possess a subtle kind of time-reversal symmetry, making their steady states exactly solvable. We focus on a model with a coherent boundary drive, showing that it exhibits a unique continuous dissipative phase transition as a function of the boundary drive amplitude. This transition has no analogue in the bulk closed system, or in incoherently driven models. We also show the steady state magnetization exhibits a surprising fractal dependence on interaction strength, something previously associated with less easily measured infinite-temperature transport quantities (the Drude weight). Our exact solution also directly yields driven-dissipative double-chain models that have pure, entangled steady states that are also current carrying.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. Symplectic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of symplectic computers, which have the potential to be more powerful than quantum computers. Unlike quantum computing, which consists of a sequence of unitary transformations (gates) and projectors (measurements), symplectic computation involves a sequence of symplectic transformations and measurements.
  The proposal to explore symplectic computers is based on the following quantum-symplectic duality. The Schr\"odinger equation in its standard complex form describes the unitary evolution of a quantum system, while its real form describes the symplectic evolution of a classical mechanical system. This quantum-symplectic duality can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of quantum and symplectic computers. In this symplectic approach, the role of a quantum bit (qubit) is taken by a symplectic bit (symbit).</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient must be classically simulable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poor man's Majorana Bound States (MBS) arise in minimal Kitaev chains when the parameters are fine-tuned to a sweet spot. We consider an interacting two-site Kitaev chain coupled to a single-mode cavity and show that the sweet spot condition can be controlled with the cavity frequency and the hopping between sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photon-mediated effective interactions can be used to screen intrinsic interactions, improving the original quality of the MBS. We describe experimental signatures in the cavity transmission to detect their presence and quality. Our work proposes a new way to tune poor man's MBS in a quantum dot array coupled to a cavity.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models</description>

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of long-range pairing Kitaev model with noiseless/noisy linear time dependent chemical potential, is investigated in the frame work of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). We have shown for the ramp crosses a single quantum critical point, while the short-range pairing Kitaev model displays a single critical time scale, the long-range pairing induces a region with three DQPTs time scales. We have found that the region with three DQPTs time scales shrinks in the presence of the noise. In addition, we have uncovered for a quench crossess two critical points, the critical sweep velocity above which the DQPTs disappear, enhances by the long-range pairing exponent while decreases in the presence of the noise. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have shown that noise diminishes the long-range pairing inductions.</description>

Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $su(2)$ algebra, $su_{\nu}(2)$, and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, in this framework the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems.</description>

Abstract: The application of knowledge from quantum physics to computer science, which we call \doubleq{quantum informatics}, is driving the development of new technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum key distribution. Researchers in physics education have recognized the promise and significance of teaching quantum informatics in schools, and various teaching methods are being developed, researched and applied. Although quantum informatics is equally relevant to computer science education, little research has been done on how to teach it with a focus on computer science concepts and knowledge. In this study, we position quantum informatics within Denning's Great Principles of Computing and propose Quantum Informatics Standards for secondary schools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a link between the virial theorem in functional analysis and the method of multipliers in theory of partial differential equations. After giving a physical insight into the techniques, we show how to use them to deduce the absence of eigenvalues and other spectral properties of electromagnetic quantum Hamiltonians. We focus on our recent developments in non-self-adjoint settings, namely on Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials, relativistic operators of Pauli and Dirac types, and complex Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete solitons in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the quasi-Riesz derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate a fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (FDNLS) equation based on an appropriately modified definition of the Riesz fractional derivative, which is characterized by its L\'{e}vy index (LI). This FDNLS equation represents a novel discrete system, in which the nearest-neighbor coupling is combined with long-range interactions, that decay as the inverse square of the separation between lattice sites. The system may be realized as an array of parallel quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of atoms or small molecules carrying, respectively, a permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment. The dispersion relation (DR) for lattice waves and the corresponding propagation band in the system's linear spectrum are found in an exact form for all values of LI. The DR is consistent with the continuum limit, differing in the range of wavenumbers. Formation of single-site and two-site discrete solitons is explored, starting from the anti-continuum limit and continuing the analysis in the numerical form up to the existence boundary of the discrete solitons. Stability of the solitons is identified in terms of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Mobility of the discrete solitons is considered too, by means of an estimate of the system's Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier, and with the help of direct simulations. Collisions between persistently moving discrete solitons are also studied.</description>

      <title>Inverse participation ratio and entanglement of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization and entanglement properties of edge states of HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry of width $L$ are studied under quantum information concepts such as: 1) inverse participation ratio (IPR), which measures localization, and 2) entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) for the spin sector, which measures quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Qualitative and quantitative information on the edge states energies and wavefunctions is extracted from analytic and numerical Hamiltonian diagonalization approaches. The previously observed exponential decay of the energy gap with $L$ and its modulations is confirmed and nontrivial consequences of the strip width and Rashba terms on the charge conductance are also reviewed. Analysis of the structure of the edge-state wave functions in terms of spin, momentum $k_x$ in the $x$-direction and position $y$, evidences the spin polarization structure of edge states at the boundaries. An IPR analysis reveals that the valence edge states show maximum localization on the boundaries for certain values of the momenta $k_x$ in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. The edge-state wave packets participate of less and less momenta as we approach to the boundaries $y=0,L$ (and also the center $y=L/2$, for some of them) of the strip. A study of the RDM to the spin sector of edge states sheds complementary information on the structure of spin probabilities in $(k_x,y)$ space, giving clear location of extremal values. The purity and entropies of the RDM inform on the regions $(k_x,y)$ where the spin sector is more and less entangled with the rest of the system, due to SOC.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations offer vast potential for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, their dynamics under the influence of gauge fields pose a significant challenge to conventional models. Here, we investigate the evolution of low-energy Majorana dispersions across various crystalline phases of the \pi-flux in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. We develop an effective tight-binding description for these low-energy Majorana fermions, introducing a gauge potential through a superexchange-like interaction that systematically eliminates the high-energy spectrum. We identify conditions under which this superexchange interaction acts as a Z2 gauge field, governing the tight-binding hopping of Majorana Wannier orbitals. Our study reveals an intriguing phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band (extensive) degeneracy. To further explore flat band physics, we introduce a mean-field theory describing a gauge-invariant Majorana density-wave order within these bands. The resulting split Chern bands facilitate the partial filling of Chern bands, effectively leading to fractional Chern states. Our work, encompassing both the gauge-mediated tight-binding model and the mean-field theory, opens doors for future exploration of $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ gauge-mediated tight-binding approach to other fractional or entangled Wannier excitations.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges per second controlled with a relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never been able to demonstrate such an accuracy. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections, hampering simplicity and further improvement. As a result, national metrology institutes still lack an operational quantum current standard. Here, we present a new quantum current generator, combining both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier, free of error correction, which provides quantized currents driven by the Josephson microwave signal. We show that it can realize the ampere definition with the target uncertainty over a range extended from mA down to $\mu$A and improve end-user current measurements, which are up to now a hundred times less accurate. Other prospects include measuring large resistances using the new current standard in conjunction with a quantum voltmeter and, by exploiting its low-noise performances, bridging the gap with the lower currents of other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum-Optimal Coronagraph Using Spatial Mode Sorters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ideal direct imaging coronagraph, which selectively rejects the fundamental mode of a telescope, has been shown to achieve the quantum information limits for exoplanet detection and localization. In this study, we experimentally implement this quantum-optimal coronagraph using spatial mode (de)multiplexing. Our benchtop system includes a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter, designed to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined, enabling direct imaging of a faint companion. We develop a probabilistic measurement model that accounts for combined effects of fundamental shot noise and experimental noise specific to our benchtop setup, such as modal cross-talk, dark noise, and ambient background illumination. We leverage this measurement model to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimator of the exoplanet position given an image captured with the coronagraph. Using this approach, we successfully localize an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances $(&lt;\sigma)$ from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast ratio. Our system accurately localizes the exoplanet up to an absolute error $&lt;0.03\sigma$ over the separation range $[0,\,0.6]\sigma$. Finally, we numerically evaluate the precision of our experimental coronagraph against state-of-the-art coronagraphs subject to comparable noise models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twist defects in surface codes can be used to encode more logical qubits, improve the code rate, and implement logical gates. In this work we provide a rigorous formalism for constructing surface codes with twists generalizing the well-defined homological formalism introduced by Kitaev for describing CSS surface codes. In particular, we associate a surface code to any graph $G$ embedded on any 2D-manifold, in such a way that (1) qubits are associated to the vertices of the graph, (2) stabilizers are associated to faces, (3) twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices. In this way, we are able to reproduce the variety of surface codes, with and without twists, in the literature and produce some new examples. We also calculate and bound various code properties such as the rate and distance in terms of topological graph properties such as genus, systole, and face-width.</description>

      <title>Atomic and entanglement dynamics in the mixed squeezed coherent state version of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent signal containing squeezed noise in a mixed state of radiation field is considered here as a non-Gaussian mixture of a coherent state density operator and a squeezed state density operator, as opposed to the usual well known squeezed coherent state. Both these states are `quantum' noise-included signal states. Effects of these two distinct ways of adding squeezing to a coherent state are compared and contrasted. The main objective of this work is to study the mixed state version of the Jaynes-Cummings model in the context of a two-level atom interacting with a mixed field state of a squeezed vacuum and a coherent state. The pure squeezed coherent state (PSCS) and the mixed squeezed coherent state (MSCS) are used as the states of the radiation field. The photon-counting distribution (PCD), the atomic inversion and the entanglement dynamics of atom-field interaction for both the radiation fields are investigated and compared with each other. We observe that depending on the state of the field, squeezing has very different effects on coherent photons. Mild squeezing on the coherent photons strongly localizes the PCD for PSCS; however, for MSCS there is no such localization observed - instead squeezing manifests for MSCS as oscillations in the PCD. The effects of squeezing on the atomic inversion and the entanglement dynamics for MSCS are contrasting in comparison with the corresponding quantities associated with PSCS. It is well known in the literature that for PSCS, increasing the squeezing increases the well-known ringing revivals in the atomic inversion, and also increases irregularity in the entanglement dynamics. However, increasing the squeezing in MSCS very significantly alters the collapse-revival pattern in the atomic inversion and the entanglement dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings model.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present an alternative methodology to the standard Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) applied to derivatives pricing. Our pipeline benefits from the combination of a new encoding protocol, referred to as the direct encoding, and a amplitude estimation algorithm, the modified Real Quantum Amplitude Estimation (mRQAE) algorithm. On the one hand, the direct encoding prepares a quantum state which contains the information about the sign of the expected payoff. On the other hand, the mRQAE is able to read all the information contained in the quantum state. Although the procedure we describe is different from the standard one, the main building blocks are almost the same. Thus, all the extensive research that has been performed is still applicable. Moreover, we experimentally compare the performance of the proposed methodology against the standard QAMC employing a quantum emulator and show that we retain the speedups.</description>

      <title>Security of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution with discrete modulation has the potential to provide information-theoretic security using widely available optical elements and existing telecom infrastructure. While their implementation is significantly simpler than that for protocols based on Gaussian modulation, proving their finite-size security against coherent attacks poses a challenge. In this work we prove finite-size security against coherent attacks for a discrete-modulated quantum key distribution protocol involving four coherent states and heterodyne detection. To do so, and contrary to most of the existing schemes, we first discretize all the continuous variables generated during the protocol. This allows us to use the entropy accumulation theorem, a tool that has previously been used in the setting of discrete variables, to construct the finite-size security proof. We then compute the corresponding finite-key rates through semi-definite programming and under a photon-number cutoff. Our analysis provides asymptotic rates in the range of $0.1-10^{-4}$ bits per round for distances up to hundred kilometres, while in the finite case and for realistic parameters, we get of the order of $10$ Gbits of secret key after $n\sim10^{11}$ rounds and distances of few tens of kilometres.</description>

      <title>Supersensitive phase estimation by thermal light in a Kerr-nonlinear interferometric setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of the phase delay between interferometer arms is the core of transmission phase microscopy. Such phase estimation may exhibit an error below the standard quantum (shot-noise) limit, if the input is an entangled two-mode state, e.g., a N00N state. We show, by contrast, that such supersensitive phase estimation (SSPE) is achievable by \textit{incoherent}, e.g., \textit{thermal}, light that is injected into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer via a Kerr-nonlinear two-mode coupler. Phase error is shown to be reduced below $1/\bar{n}$, $\bar{n}$ being the mean photon number, by thermal input in such interferometric setups, even for small nonlinear phase-shifts per photon pair or for significant photon loss. Remarkably, the phase accuracy achievable in such setups by thermal input surpasses that of coherent light with the same $\bar{n}$. Available mode couplers with giant Kerr nonlinearity that stems either from dipole-dipole interactions of Rydberg polaritons in a cold atomic gas, or from cavity-enhanced dispersive atom-field interactions, may exploit such effects to substantially advance interferometric phase microscopy using incoherent, faint light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15648v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general denoising algorithm for performing simultaneous tomography of quantum states and measurement noise. This algorithm allows us to fully characterize state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors present in any quantum system. Our method is based on the analysis of the properties of the linear operator space induced by unitary operations. Given any quantum system with a noisy measurement apparatus, our method can output the quantum state and the noise matrix of the detector up to a single gauge degree of freedom. We show that this gauge freedom is unavoidable in the general case, but this degeneracy can be generally broken using prior knowledge on the state or noise properties, thus fixing the gauge for several types of state-noise combinations with no assumptions about noise strength. Such combinations include pure quantum states with arbitrarily correlated errors, and arbitrary states with block independent errors. This framework can further use available prior information about the setting to systematically reduce the number of observations and measurements required for state and noise detection. Our method effectively generalizes existing approaches to the problem, and includes as special cases common settings considered in the literature requiring an uncorrelated or invertible noise matrix, or specific probe states.</description>

Abstract: A Floquet quantum system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time. Consider the space of piecewise time-independent Floquet systems with (geometrically) local interactions. We prove that for all but a measure zero set of systems in this space, starting from a random product state, many properties (including expectation values of observables and the entanglement entropy of a macroscopically large subsystem) at long times are approximately periodic with the same period as the Hamiltonian. Thus, in almost every Floquet system of arbitrarily large but finite size, discrete time-crystalline behavior does not persist to strictly infinite time.</description>

Abstract: We have used quantum control to suppress the impact of random atom positions on coherent population transfer within atom pairs, enabling the observation of dipole-dipole driven Rabi oscillations in a Rydberg gas with hundreds of atoms. The method exploits the reduced coupling-strength sensitivity of the off-resonant Rabi frequency, and coherently amplifies the achievable population transfer in analogy to quasi-phase-matching in non-linear optics. Simulations reproduce the experimental results and demonstrate the potential benefits of the technique to other many-body quantum control applications.</description>

A key feature of the architecture is its practicality, grounded in the utilisation of experimentally proven optical components. Our framework enables the execution of any quantum error correcting code, but in particular maintains scalability for low-density parity check codes by exploiting built-in non-local connectivity through distant optical links. To gauge its efficiency, we evaluated the architecture using a physically motivated error model. It exhibits loss tolerance comparable to existing all-photonic architecture but without the need for intricate linear-optical resource-state-generation modules that conventionally rely on resource-intensive multiplexing. The versatility of the architecture also offers uncharted avenues for further advancing performance standards.</description>

      <title>Recovery of damaged information via scrambling in indefinite casual order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scrambling prevents the access to local information with local operators and therefore can be used to protect quantum information from damage caused by local perturbations. Even though partial quantum information can be recovered if the type of the damage is known, the initial target state cannot be completely recovered, because the obtained state is a mixture of the initial state and a maximally mixed state. Here, we demonstrate an improved scheme to recover damaged quantum information via scrambling in indefinite causal order. We show that scheme with indefinite causal order can record information of the damage and distill the initial state from the damaged state simultaneously. It allows us to retrieve initial information versus any damage. Moreover, by iterating the schemes, the initial quantum state can be completely recovered. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate our schemes on the cloud-based quantum computer, named as Quafu. Our work proposes a feasible scheme to protect whole quantum information from damage, which is also compatible with other techniques such as quantum error corrections and entanglement purification protocols. We expect that our scheme will be useful in the both quantum information recovery from the damage and systems bench-marking.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multigrid Ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging topic in engineering that promises to enhance supercomputing using fundamental physics. In the near term, the best candidate algorithms for achieving this advantage are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). We design and numerically evaluate a novel ansatz for VQAs, focusing in particular on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). As our ansatz is inspired by classical multigrid hierarchy methods, we call it "multigrid" ansatz. The multigrid ansatz creates a parameterized quantum circuit for a quantum problem on $n$ qubits by successively building and optimizing circuits for smaller qubit counts $j &lt; n$, reusing optimized parameter values as initial solutions to next level hierarchy at $j+1$. We show through numerical simulation that the multigrid ansatz outperforms the standard hardware-efficient ansatz in terms of solution quality for the Laplacian eigensolver as well as for a large class of combinatorial optimization problems with specific examples for MaxCut and Maximum $k$-Satisfiability. Our studies establish the multi-grid ansatz as a viable candidate for many VQAs and in particular present a promising alternative to the QAOA approach for combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) schemes allow two or more parties to conjointly compute a function on their private input sets while revealing nothing but the output. Existing state-of-the-art number-theoretic-based designs face the threat of attacks through quantum algorithms. In this context, we present secure MPC protocols that can withstand quantum attacks. We first present the design and analysis of an information-theoretic secure oblivious linear evaluation (OLE), namely ${\sf qOLE}$ in the quantum domain, and show that our ${\sf qOLE}$ is safe from external attacks. In addition, our scheme satisfies all the security requirements of a secure OLE. We further utilize ${\sf qOLE}$ as a building block to construct a quantum-safe multiparty private set intersection (MPSI) protocol.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effect in a one-dimensional open many-body quantum system with generalized boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely that eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonains are localized at one boundary in the open boundary condition, attracts great interest recently.In this paper, we investigate the skin effect in one-dimensional dissipative quantum many-body systems, which we call the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). We rigorously identify the existence of LSE for generalized boundary conditions by solving the Liouvillian superoperator of an exactly solvable model with the advantage of Bethe ansatz. The LSE is sensitive to boundary conditions where the signature is reflected in eigenfunctions of the system. We confirm that the LSE is fragile to a tiny co-flow boundary hopping with non-Hermitian current but can survive for a counter-flow boundary hopping in the thermodynamic limit. Our work provides a prototypical example of exactly solvable dissipative quantum many-body lattice systems exhibiting LSE for generalized boundary conditions. It can be further extended to other integrable open quantum many-body models.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounded by Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for the Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to other inequalities in the literature (e.g.~the van Trees inequality) that are useful also for cases where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We then generalize them to the quantum case, where they bound the Holevo information in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information (useful for global strategies where the prior plays an important role) the known and highly nontrivial bounds for the Fisher information in the presence of noise. The results are also useful in the context of quantum communication, both for continuous and discrete alphabets.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing thermalization dynamics of non-Hermitian quantum systems via GKSL master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time evolutions, we have derived two versions of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization and thermodynamic properties with test models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computer simulation software is an integral tool for the research efforts in the quantum computing community. An important aspect is the efficiency of respective frameworks, especially for training variational quantum algorithms. Focusing on the widely used Qiskit software environment, we develop the qiskit-torch-module. It improves runtime performance by two orders of magnitude over comparable libraries, while facilitating low-overhead integration with existing codebases. Moreover, the framework provides advanced tools for integrating quantum neural networks with PyTorch. The pipeline is tailored for single-machine compute systems, which constitute a widely employed setup in day-to-day research efforts.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework aiming to determine optimal behavior in highly complex decision-making scenarios. This objective can be achieved using policy iteration, which requires to solve a typically large linear system of equations. We propose the variational quantum policy iteration (VarQPI) algorithm, realizing this step with a NISQ-compatible quantum-enhanced subroutine. Its scalability is supported by an analysis of the structure of generic reinforcement learning environments, laying the foundation for potential quantum advantage with utility-scale quantum computers. Furthermore, we introduce the warm-start initialization variant (WS-VarQPI) that significantly reduces resource overhead. The algorithm solves a large FrozenLake environment with an underlying 256x256-dimensional linear system, indicating its practical robustness.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Biphoton Spatial Wave Function Dynamics with Quantum Wavefront Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an extremely high dimensionality, the spatial degree of freedom of entangled photons is a key tool for quantum foundation and applied quantum techniques. To fully utilize the feature, the essential task is to experimentally characterize the multiphoton spatial wave function including the entangled amplitude and phase information at different evolutionary stages. However, there is no effective method to measure it. Quantum state tomography is costly, and quantum holography requires additional references. Here we introduce quantum Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing to perform efficient and reference-free measurement of the biphoton spatial wave function. The joint probability distribution of photon pairs at the back focal plane of a microlens array is measured and used for amplitude extraction and phase reconstruction. In the experiment, we observe that the biphoton amplitude correlation becomes weak while phase correlation shows up during free-space propagation. Our work is a crucial step in quantum physical and adaptive optics and paves the way for characterizing quantum optical fields with high-order correlations or topological patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present estimates for the number of ions needed to implement fault-tolerant lattice surgery between spatially separated trapped-ion surface codes. Additionally, we determine attainable lattice surgery rates given a number of dedicated "communication ions" per logical qubit. Because our analysis depends heavily on the rate that syndrome extraction cycles take place, we survey the state-of the art and propose three possible cycle times between $10$ and $1000 \mu s$ that we could reasonably see realised provided certain technological milestones are met. Consequently, our numerical results indicate that hundreds of resource ions will be needed for lattice surgery in the slowest case, while close to a hundred thousand will be needed in the fastest case. The main factor contributing to these prohibitive estimates is the limited rate that ions can be coupled across traps. Our results therefore indicate an urgent need for improved optical coupling in order for trapped-ion quantum computers to scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technological development of increasingly larger quantum processors on different quantum platforms raises the problem of how to fairly compare their performance, known as quantum benchmarking of quantum processors. This is a challenge that computer scientists have already faced when comparing classical processors, leading to the development of various mathematical tools to address it, but also to the identification of the limits of this problem. In this work, we briefly review the most important aspects of both classical processor benchmarks and the metrics comprising them, providing precise definitions and analyzing the quality attributes that they should exhibit. Subsequently, we analyze the intrinsic properties that characterize the paradigm of quantum computing and hinder the naive transfer of strategies from classical benchmarking. However, we can still leverage some of the lessons learned such as the quality attributes of a \textit{good} benchmark. Additionally, we review some of the most important metrics and benchmarks for quantum processors proposed in the literature, assessing what quality attributes they fulfill. Finally, we propose general guidelines for quantum benchmarking. These guidelines aim to pave the way for establishing a roadmap towards standardizing the performance evaluation of quantum devices, ultimately leading to the creation of an organization akin to the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).</description>

Abstract: Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the main tasks of experimental physics. Candidates for dark matter include axion-like ultralight bosonic particles. Comagnetometers form ultra-high sensitivity probes for such particles and any exotic field that interacts with the spin of an atom. Here, we propose a multi-atom-species probe that enables not only to discover such fields and measure their spectrum but also to determine the ratios of their coupling strengths to sub-atomic elementary particles, electrons, neutrons and protons. We further show that the multi-faceted capabilities of this probe may be demonstrated with synthetic exotic fields generated by a combination of regular magnetic fields and light-induced fictitious magnetic fields in alkali atoms. These synthetic fields also enable the accurate calibration of any magnetometer or comagnetometer probe for exotic physics.</description>

Abstract: One of the prominent platforms for quantum technologies, cold atoms require reliable laser systems. We present the design, implementation, and characterization of a simple, compact, and economical laser system at 780 nm, entirely based on fiber components. Two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm are amplified in a single Erbium-doped fiber amplifier and frequency-doubled in a periodically-poled lithium niobate crystal. We characterize the amplitude noise and the linewidths of the lasers, as well as the SHG efficiency. With a rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s and linewidths below 1 MHz, our system is suitable for cooling and trapping of Rb atoms.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation in quantum Hall system with an expanding edge: application of anomaly method</title>

Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>
