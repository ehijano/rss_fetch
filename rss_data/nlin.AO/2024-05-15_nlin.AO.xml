      <title>Scalable synchronization cluster in networked chaotic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster synchronization in synthetic networks of coupled chaotic oscillators is investigated. It is found that despite the asymmetric nature of the network structure, a subset of the oscillators can be synchronized as a cluster while the other oscillators remain desynchronized. Interestingly, with the increase of the coupling strength, the cluster is expanding gradually by recruiting the desynchronized oscillators one by one. This new synchronization phenomenon, which is named ``scalable synchronization cluster", is explored theoretically by the method of eigenvector-based analysis, and it is revealed that the scalability of the cluster is attributed to the unique feature of the eigenvectors of the network coupling matrix. The transient dynamics of the cluster in response to random perturbations are also studied, and it is shown that in restoring to the synchronization state, oscillators inside the cluster are stabilized in sequence, illustrating again the hierarchy of the oscillators. The findings shed new light on the collective behaviors of networked chaotic oscillators, and are helpful for the design of real-world networks where scalable synchronization clusters are concerned.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of E. coli bacteria moving in coupled wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization plays a crucial role in the dynamics of living organisms, from fireflies flashing in unison to pacemaker cells that jointly generate heartbeats. Uncovering the mechanism behind these phenomena requires an understanding of individual biological oscillators and the coupling forces between them. Here, we develop a single-cell assay that studies rhythmic behavior in the motility of individual E.coli cells that can be mutually synchronized. Circular microcavities are used to isolate E.coli cells that swim along the cavity wall, resulting in self-sustained oscillations. Upon connecting these cavities by microchannels the bacterial motions can be coupled, yielding nonlinear dynamic synchronization patterns with phase slips. We demonstrate that the coordinated movement observed in coupled E. coli oscillators follows mathematical rules of synchronization which we use to quantify the coupling strength. These findings advance our understanding of motility in confinement, and lay the foundation for engineering desired dynamics in microbial active matter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? We consider learning period three with random neural networks and report the universal property associated with it. We first show that the trained networks have a thermodynamic limit that depends on the choice of target data and network settings. Our analysis reveals that almost all learned periods are unstable and each network has its characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). Here, we propose the concept of characteristic bifurcation expressing embeddable attractors intrinsic to the network, in which the target data points and the scale of the network weights function as bifurcation parameters. In conclusion, learning period three generates various attractors through characteristic bifurcation due to the stability change in latently existing numerous unstable periods of the system.</description>

      <title>On the quantum origin of limit cycles, fixed points, and critical slowing down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto Oscillators and Swarms on Manifolds for Geometry Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the idea of using Kuramoto models (including their higher-dimensional generalizations) for machine learning over non-Euclidean data sets. These models are systems of matrix ODE's describing collective motions (swarming dynamics) of abstract particles (generalized oscillators) on spheres, homogeneous spaces and Lie groups. Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.</description>

      <title>Dynein-driven self-organization of microtubules: An entropy- and network-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microtubules self-organize to form part of the cellular cytoskeleton. They give cells their shape and play a crucial role in cell division and intracellular transport. Strikingly, microtubules driven by motor proteins reorganize into stable mitotic/meiotic spindles with high spatial and temporal precision during successive cell division cycles. Although the topic has been extensively studied, the question remains: What defines such microtubule networks' spatial order and robustness? Here, we aim to approach this problem by analyzing a simplified computational model of radial microtubule self-organization driven by a single type of motor protein -- dyneins. We establish that the spatial order of the steady-state pattern is likely associated with the dynein-driven microtubule motility. At the same time, the structure of the microtubule network is likely linked to its connectivity at the beginning of self-organization. Using the continuous variation of dynein concentration, we reveal hysteresis in microtubule self-organization, ensuring the stability of radial filament structures.</description>
