      <title>When does Gaussian equivalence fail and how to fix it: Non-universal behavior of random features with quadratic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major effort in modern high-dimensional statistics has been devoted to the analysis of linear predictors trained on nonlinear feature embeddings via empirical risk minimization (ERM). Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.
  We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.
  Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM.</description>

      <title>A note on the impossibility of conditional PAC-efficient reasoning in large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an impossibility result for conditional Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-efficient reasoning in large language models. While recent work has established marginal PAC efficiency guarantees for composite models that switch between expensive expert models and cheaper fast models, we show that conditional (pointwise) guarantees are impossible in the distribution-free setting. Specifically, for non-atomic input spaces, any algorithm achieving conditional PAC efficiency must be trivial in the sense that it defers to the expert model with probability at least $1-\alpha$ for almost every input.</description>

      <title>Novelty detection on path space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We frame novelty detection on path space as a hypothesis testing problem with signature-based test statistics. Using transportation-cost inequalities of Gasteratos and Jacquier (2023), we obtain tail bounds for false positive rates that extend beyond Gaussian measures to laws of RDE solutions with smooth bounded vector fields, yielding estimates of quantiles and p-values. Exploiting the shuffle product, we derive exact formulae for smooth surrogates of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in terms of expected signatures, leading to new one-class SVM algorithms optimising smooth CVaR objectives. We then establish lower bounds on type-$\mathrm{II}$ error for alternatives with finite first moment, giving general power bounds when the reference measure and the alternative are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. Finally, we evaluate numerically the type-$\mathrm{I}$ error and statistical power of signature-based test statistic, using synthetic anomalous diffusion data and real-world molecular biology data.</description>

      <title>Invited Discussion of "Model Uncertainty and Missing Data: An Objective Bayesian Perspective" by Gonzalo Garc\'ia-Donato , Mar\'ia Eugenia Castellanos , Stefano Cabras Alicia Quir\'os , and Anabel Forte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article by Garc{\'i}a-Donato and co-authors addresses the dual challenges of accounting for model uncertainty and missing data within the Gaussian regression frameworks from an objective Bayesian perspective. Thru the use of an imputation $g$-prior that replaces $X_\gamma^TX_\gamma$ for model $\gamma$ in the covariance of $\beta_\gamma$ with $\Sigma_{X_\gamma}$, the authors develop a coherent approach to addressing the missing data problem and model uncertainty simultaneously with random $X_\gamma$ in the missing at random (MAR) or missing completely at random (MCAR) settings, while still being computationally tractable. I discuss the connection of the imputation $g$-prior to the $g$-prior with imputed $X$, and to model selection for graphical models that provide an alternative justification for the $g$-prior for random $X$s.</description>

      <title>Sketch Tomography: Hybridizing Classical Shadow and Matrix Product State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transportation and Alignment Between Gaussian Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment provide interpretable geometric frameworks for comparing, transforming, and aggregating heterogeneous datasets -- tasks ubiquitous in data science and machine learning. Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Closing the problem of which causal structures of up to six total nodes have a classical-quantum gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.</description>

      <title>Inference for location and height of peaks of a standardized field after selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peak inference concerns the use of local maxima ("peaks") of a noisy random field to detect and localize regions where underlying signal is present. We propose a peak inference method that first subjects observed peaks to a significance test of the null hypothesis that no signal is present, and then uses the peaks that are declared significant to construct post-selectively valid confidence regions for the location and height of nearby true peaks. We analyze the performance of this method in a smooth signal plus constant variance noise model under a high-curvature asymptotic assumption, and prove that it asymptotically controls both the number of false discoveries, and the number of confidence regions that do not contain a true peak, relative to the number of points at which inference is conducted. An important intermediate theoretical result uses the Kac-Rice formula to derive a novel approximation to the intensity function of a point process that counts local maxima, which is second-order accurate under the alternative, nearby high-curvature true peaks.</description>

      <title>Rates of Convergence of Generalised Variational Inference Posteriors under Prior Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove rates of convergence and robustness to prior misspecification within a Generalised Variational Inference (GVI) framework with bounded divergences. This addresses a significant open challenge for GVI and Federated GVI that employ a different divergence to the Kullback-Leibler under prior misspecification, operate within a subset of possible probability measures, and result in intractable posteriors. Our theoretical contributions extend to misspecified priors that lead to inconsistent Bayes posteriors. In particular, we are able to establish sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of GVI posteriors on arbitrary Polish spaces, prove that the GVI posterior measure concentrates on a neighbourhood of loss minimisers, and extend this to rates of convergence regardless of the prior measure.</description>

      <title>Sharp Self-Normalized Concentration Inequalities of Marginal Mean with Sample Variance Only</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (This is the first version of a working paper. A more detailed follow-up with applications is in preparation.) We develop a family of self-normalized concentration inequalities for marginal mean under martingale-difference structure and $\phi/\tilde{\phi}$-mixing conditions, where the latter includes many processes that are not strongly mixing. The variance term is fully data-observable: naive sample variance in the martingale case and an empirical block long-run variance under mixing conditions. Thus, no predictable variance proxy is required. No specific assumption on the decay of the mixing coefficients (e.g. summability) is needed for the validity. The constants are explicit and the bounds are ready to use.</description>

      <title>Class conditional conformal prediction for multiple inputs by p-value aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through user-submitted images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for risk estimation, inspired by the axiomatic theory of risk measures. Coherent risk estimators -- functionals of P&amp;L samples inheriting the economic properties of risk measures -- are defined and characterized through robust representations linked to $L$-estimators. The framework provides a canonical methodology for constructing estimators with sound financial and statistical properties, unifying risk measure theory, principles for capital adequacy, and practical statistical challenges in market risk. A numerical study illustrates the approach, focusing on expected shortfall estimation under both i.i.d. and overlapping samples relevant for regulatory FRTB model applications.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>
