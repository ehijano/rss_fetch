      <title>Upper Bounds on the Chromatic Index of Linear Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of finding upper bounds on the chromatic index $q(V,E)$ of linear (and loopless) hypergraphs. The first bound we find is defined through a color-preserving group on a proper and minimally edge-colored linear hypergraph, whose orbits serve as a finer partition to the hypergraph's coloring, thereby yielding an upper bound on $q(V,E)$. The next set of theorems in this paper relates to combinatorial properties of hypergraph coloring. Our results suggest a plausible approach to solving the Berge-F\"{u}redi conjecture, providing an upper bound on the chromatic index that directly relates $q(V,E)$ and $\Delta([(V,E)]_{2}) + 1$. Furthermore, we provide three sufficient conditions for the conjecture to hold within this framework, when involving the Helly property for hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A neighborhood union condition for the existence of a spanning tree without samll degree vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer k\ge2, a [2,k]-ST of a connected graph G is a spanning tree of G in which there are no vertices of degree between 2 and k. A [2,k]-ST is a natural extension of a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST), which is a spanning tree without vertices of degree 2. In this paper, we give a neighborhood union condition for the existence of a [2,k]-ST in G. We generalize a known degree sum condition that guarantees the existence of a [2,k]-ST in G.</description>

      <title>Promotion permutations and the Robinson--Schensted correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promotion permutations have recently been associated to each rectangular standard Young tableau by Gaetz--Pechenik--Pfannerer--Striker--Swanson. Here we relate promotion permutations to the Robinson--Schensted (RS) correspondence. More precisely, we show that taking a pair of standard Young tableaux of the same rectangular shape, stacking them, and computing the middle promotion permutation yields the RS permutation of the pair up to simple twists. Moreover, the full list of promotion permutations in this special case encodes Viennot's geometric shadow line construction. As a consequence, we characterize a subset of the collection of possible promotion permutations in terms of crossing and nesting numbers.</description>

      <title>Progress towards generalized Nash-Williams' conjecture on $K_4$-decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $K_4$-decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $K_4$s. A fractional $K_4$-decomposition is an assignment of a nonnegative weight to each $K_4$ in a graph such that the sum of the weights of the $K_4$s containing any given edge is one. Formulating a nonlinear programming and reducing the number of variables slowly, we prove that every graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $\frac{31}{33}n$ has a fractional $K_4$-decomposition. This improves a result of Montgomery that the same conclusion holds for graphs with minimum degree at least $\frac{399}{400}n$. Together with a result of Barber, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus, this result implies that for all $\varepsilon&gt; 0$, every large enough $K_4$-divisible graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $(\frac{31}{33}+\varepsilon)n$ admits a $K_4$-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Lorentzian Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of Lorentzian symmetric polynomials and Lorentzian symmetric functions, which are defined to be symmetric functions for which every truncation of variables is Lorentzian. Similar to the space of Lorentzian polynomials, we show that the space of Lorentzian symmetric polynomials is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. Our main result is a reduction scheme that significantly reduces the complexity of testing for Lorentzianity. Using this method, we provide explicit semialgebraic descriptions of the spaces of Lorentzian symmetric polynomials and functions for degrees up to six. These techniques can also be applied to simplify the proofs to known cases of Lorentzian symmetric functions. We conclude by showing that some natural symmetric operators fail to preserve Lorentzianity which in turn highlights an inherent tension between symmetry in variables and the Lorentzian property.</description>

      <title>Rearrangements of distributions on integers that minimize variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which permutations of a probability distribution on integers minimize variance?
  Let $X$ be a random variable on a set of integers $\{x_1, \dots, x_N\}$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_i = x_i) = p_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots,N\}$. Let $(p^{(1)}, \dots, p^{(N)})$ be the sequence $(p_1, \dots, p_N)$ ordered non-increasingly. Let $X^+$ be the random variable defined by $\mathbb{P}(X=0)=p^{(1)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X=1) = p^{(2)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X=-1)=p^{(3)}, \dots, \mathbb{P}(X=(-1)^N \lfloor \frac {N} 2 \rfloor)=p^{(N)}$. In this short note we generalize and prove the inequality $\mathrm{Var}\, X^+ \le \mathrm{Var}\, X$.</description>

      <title>Extremal constructions for apex partite hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new lower bounds for the Tur\'an and Zarankiewicz numbers of certain apex partite hypergraphs. Given a $(d-1)$-partite $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, let $\mathcal{H}(k)$ be the $d$-partite $d$-uniform hypergraph whose $d$th part has $k$ vertices that share $\mathcal{ H}$ as a common link. We show that $ex(n,\mathcal{H}(k))=\Omega_{\mathcal{ H}}(n^{d-\frac{1}{e(\mathcal{H})}})$ if $k$ is at least exponentially large in $e(\mathcal{H})$. Our bound is optimal for all Sidorenko hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$ and verifies a conjecture of Lee for such hypergraphs.
  In particular, for the complete $d$-partite $d$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{K}^{(d)}_{s_1,\dots,s_d}$, our result implies that $ex(n,\mathcal{K}^{(d)}_{s_{1},\cdots,s_{d}})=\Theta(n^{d-\frac{1}{s_{1}\cdots s_{d-1}}})$ if $s_{d}$ is at least exponentially large in terms of $s_{1}\cdots s_{d-1}$, improving the factorial condition of Pohoata and Zakharov and answering a question of Mubayi. Our method is a generalization of Bukh's random algebraic method [Duke Math.J. 2024] to hypergraphs, and extends to the sided Zarankiewicz problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes combinatorial characterisations of forced-symmetric and forced-periodic rigidity (under a fixed lattice) of bar-joint frameworks in non-Euclidean normed planes. In $\ell_q$-planes for $q\in(1,\infty)\backslash\{2\}$, we prove characterisations for periodic rigidity and finite reflectionally-symmetric rigidity. We also characterise symmetric rigidity in this space with respect to the orientation-reversing wallpaper group $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes\mathcal{C}_s$, otherwise known as $pm$ in crystallography. In the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$-planes, we provide characterisations for periodic rigidity and $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes\mathcal{C}_s$-symmetric rigidity. All of these characterisations are proved by inductive constructions involving Henneberg-type graph operations.</description>

      <title>Nowhere-zero flows on signed supereulerian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983, Bouchet conjectured that every flow-admissible signed graph admits a nowhere-zero 6-flow. We verify this conjecture for the class of flow-admissible signed graphs possessing a spanning even Eulerian subgraph, which includes as a special case all signed graphs with a balanced Hamiltonian circuit. Furthermore, we show that this result is sharp by citing a known infinite family of signed graphs with a balanced Hamiltonian circuit that do not admit a nowhere-zero 5-flow. Our proof relies on a construction that transforms signed graphs whose underlying graph admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow into a signed 3-edge-colorable cubic graph. This transformation has the crucial property of establishing a sign-preserving bijection between the bichromatic cycles of the resulting signed cubic graph and certain Eulerian subgraphs of the original signed graph. As an application of our main result, we also show that Bouchet's conjecture holds for all signed abelian Cayley graphs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of the refined $q,t$-Catalan polynomials for $\vec{k}$-Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pappe, Paul, and Schilling introduced two combinatorial statistics, depth and ddinv, associated with classical Dyck paths, and proved that the distributions of (area, depth) and (dinv, ddinv) are $q,t$-symmetric by constructing an involution on plane trees. They also provided a new formula for the original $q,t$-Catalan polynomials $C_{n}(q,t)$. We observe that depth is a slight modification of bounce, which was defined by the filling algorithm and ranking algorithm of Xin and the second author in their study of $\vec{k}$-Dyck paths. In this article, we generalize depth of classical Dyck paths to the case of $\vec{k}$-Dyck paths and prove $q,t$-symmetry of the pair of statistics (area, depth) for $\mathcal{K}$-Dyck paths. We provide an alternative description of the higher $q,t$-Catalan polynomials $C_{n}^{(k)}(q,t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian polynomial, which is also known as $q$-binomial coefficient, is one of the fundamental concepts in the theory of partitions. Zeilberger provided a combinatorial proof of Gaussian polynomial, which is called Algorithm Z by Andrews and Bressoud. In this paper, we provide a new bijection on Gaussian polynomial, which leads to a refinement of Algorithm Z. Moreover, using this bijection, we provide an alternative proof of generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identity, which was first proved by Bressoud and Zeilberger. Furthermore, we give a combinatorial proof of the monotonicity property of Garvan's $k$-rank, which is a generalization of Dyson's rank and Andrews-Garvan's crank.</description>

      <title>An update on the existence of integer Heffter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer Heffter array $H(m,n;s;k)$ is an $m\times n$ partially filled array whose entries are the elements of a subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\{\Omega,-\Omega\}$ is a partition of the set $\{1,2,\ldots,2nk\}$ and such that the following conditions are satisfied: each row contains $s$ filled cells, each column contains $k$ filled cells, the elements in every row and column add up to $0$. It was conjectured by Dan Archdeacon that an integer $\H(m,n;s;k)$ exists if and only if $ms=nk$, $3\leq s \leq n$, $3\leq k\leq m$ and $nk\equiv 0,3\pmod 4$. In this paper, we provide new constructions of these objects that allow us to prove the validity of Archdeacon's conjecture in each admissible case, except when $k=3,5$ and $s\not \equiv 0\pmod 4$ is such that $\gcd(s,k)=1$.</description>

Abstract: Using the graphs of prisms and Tutte Fragments, we construct an infinite family of hamiltonian and non-hamiltonian graphs in which Tutte's counterexample to Tait's conjecture appears in a certain sense as a minimal element. We observe that generalizations of the minimum-cardinality counterexamples of Holton and McKay to Tait's conjecture are as well contained in this family.</description>

      <title>Isolation of non-triangle cycles in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G, \mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of cycles, and let $\mathcal{C}'$ be the set of non-triangle cycles (that is, cycles of length at least $4$). Let $G$ be a connected graph having exactly $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The first author proved that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}) \leq n/4$ if $G$ is not a triangle. Bartolo and the authors proved that $\iota(G,\{C_4\}) \leq n/5$ if $G$ is not a copy of one of nine graphs. Various authors proved that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}) \leq (m+1)/5$ if $G$ is not a triangle. We prove that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}') \leq (m+1)/6$ if $G$ is not a $4$-cycle. Zhang and Wu established this for the case where $G$ is triangle-free. Our result yields the inequality $\iota(G,\{C_4\}) \leq (m+1)/6$ of Wei, Zhang and Zhao. These bounds are attained by infinitely many (non-isomorphic) graphs. The proof of our inequality hinges on also determining the graphs attaining the bound.</description>

      <title>The 3-state Potts model on planar triangulations: explicit algebraic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $3$-state Potts generating function $T(\nu,w)$ of planar triangulations; that is, the bivariate series that counts planar triangulations with vertices coloured in $3$ colours, weighted by their size (number of vertices, recorded by the variable $w$) and by the number of monochromatic edges (variable $\nu$).
  This series was proved to be algebraic 15 years ago by Bernardi and the first author: this follows from its link with the solution of a discrete differential equation (DDE), and from general algebraicity results on such equations. However, despite recent progresses on the effective solution of DDEs, the exact value of $T(\nu,w)$ has remained unknown so far -- except in the case $\nu=0$, corresponding to proper colourings and solved by Tutte in the sixties. We determine here this exact value, proving that $T(\nu,w)$ satisfies a polynomial equation of degree $11$ in $T$ and genus $1$ in $w$ and $T$. We prove that the critical value of $\nu$ is $\nu_c=1+3/\sqrt{47}$, with a critical exponent $6/5$ in the series $T(\nu_c, \cdot)$, while the other values of $\nu$ yield the usual map exponent $3/2$.
  By duality of the planar Potts model, our results also characterize the 3-state Potts generating function of planar cubic maps, in which all vertices have degree $3$. In particular, the annihilating polynomial, still of degree $11$, that we obtain for properly 3-coloured cubic maps proves a conjecture by Bruno Salvy from 2009.</description>

Abstract: We study sections of line bundles on the nested Hilbert scheme of points on the affine plane. We describe the spaces of sections in terms of certain ideals introduced by Haiman, and find explicit bases for them by analyzing the trailing terms in some monomial order. As a consequence, we compute the Newton-Okounkov bodies for nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Classical Simulators for Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum advantage in computation refers to the existence of computational tasks that can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer but cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical computer. Identifying the precise boundary of efficient classical simulability is a central challenge and motivates the development of new simulation paradigms. In this paper, we introduce polyhedral classical simulators, a framework for classical simulation grounded in polyhedral geometry. This framework encompasses well-known methods such as the Gottesman-Knill algorithm, while also extending naturally to more recent models of quantum computation, including those based on magic states and measurement-based quantum computation. We show how this framework unifies and extends existing simu- lation methods while at the same time providing a geometric roadmap for pushing the boundary of efficient classical simulation further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum version of the $n$-dimer model from statistical mechanics, based on the formalism from quantum topology developed by Reshetikhin and Turaev (the latter which, in particular, can be used to construct the Jones polynomial of a knot in $\mathbb{R}^3$). We apply this machinery to construct an isotopy invariant polynomial for knotted bipartite ribbon graphs in $\mathbb{R}^3$, giving, in the planar setting, a quantum $n$-dimer partition function. As one application, we compute the expected number of loops in the (classical) double dimer model for planar bipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of bicrystalline ideals, synthesizing Gr\"obner basis techniques and Kashiwara's crystal theory. This provides a unified algebraic, combinatorial, and computational approach that applies to ideals of interest, old and new. The theory concerns ideals in the coordinate ring of matrices, stable under the action of some Levi group, whose quotients admit standard bases equipped with a crystal structure. We construct an effective algorithm to decide if an ideal is bicrystalline. When the answer is affirmative, we provide a uniform, generalized Littlewood-Richardson rule for computing the multiplicity of irreducible representations either for the quotient or the ideal itself.</description>

      <title>Strict Log-concavity of $k$-coloured Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been extensive work on inequalities among partition functions. In particular, Nicolas, and independently DeSalvo--Pak, proved that the partition function $p(n)$ is eventually log-concave. Inspired by this and other results, Chern--Fu--Tang first conjectured log-concavity of $k$-coloured partitions. Three of the authors and Tripp later proved this conjecture by introducing recursive sequences and a strict inequality for fractional partition functions, giving explicit errors. In this paper, we show that the log-concavity is, in fact, strict for $k\geq 2$. We shed further light on this phenomenon by utilizing Hardy--Littlewood--P\'olya's notion of majorizing. We prove that for partitions $\bm{a},\bm{b}$ of $n\in\N$, if $\bm b$ majorizes $\bm a$, then $p_k(\bm{b})&gt;p_k(\bm{a})$. Numerical calculations indicate that our result is sharp.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Rule-Based Achlioptas Processes for Random $k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the "power-of-two-choices" model from random graphs, we investigate the possibility of limited choices of online clause choices that could shift the satisfiability threshold in random $k$-SAT.Here, we introduce an assignment symmetric, non-adaptive, topology-oblivious online rule called \emph{MIDDLE-HEAVY}, that prioritizes balanced sign profile clauses.Upon applying a biased $2$-SAT projection and a two-type branching process certificate, we derive closed-form expressions for the shifted thresholds $\alpha_{\textbf{SYM}}(k,\ell)$ for this algorithm.We show that minimal choices $\ell=5$ for $k=4$, $\ell=4$ for $k=5$, and $\ell=3$ for $k\ge 6$ suffice to exceed the asymptotic first-moment upper bound $\sim 2^k \ln 2$ for random $k$-SAT.Moreover, to bridge the gap with biased assignment rules used in maximum of the previous works in this context, we propose a hybrid symmetric biased rule that achieves thresholds comparable to prior work while maintaining symmetry.Our results advance the understanding of Achlioptas processes in random CSPs beyond classical graph-theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles II: Vertex and Edge Deletion Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary problems $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Path}$ and $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Cycle}$ are in $\mathsf{FPT}$. In particular, we focus on parameters that describe how many vertices and edges have to be deleted to become a member of a certain graph class. We show that the problems are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for such restricted cases as vertex distance to path and vertex distance to clique. We complement these results by showing that the problems can be solved in $\mathsf{XP}$ time for vertex distance to outerplanar and vertex distance to block. Furthermore, we present some $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms, e.g., for edge distance to block. Additionally, we prove para-$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness when considered with the edge clique cover number.</description>

The objective of this text is to carry out this study in the case of some cyclic subgroups of ($\mathbb{C},+$). In particular we will study the case of the cyclic subgroups generated by $\sqrt{k}$ and $i\sqrt{k}$, with $k \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Alternating sign matrices with reflective symmetry and plane partitions: $n+3$ pairs of equivalent statistics and a Cauchy-type identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertically symmetric alternating sign matrices (VSASMs) of order $2n+1$ are known to be equinumerous with lozenge tilings of a hexagon with side lengths $2n+2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, $2n$ and a central triangular hole of size $2$ that exhibit a cyclical as well as a vertical symmetry, but finding an explicit bijection proving this belongs to the most difficult problems in bijective combinatorics. Towards constructing such a bijection, we generalize the result by introducing certain natural extensions for both objects along with $n+3$ parameters and show that the multivariate generating functions with respect to these parameters coincide. This is a significant step from a constant number of equidistributed statistics to a linear number of statistics in $n$. The equinumeracy of VSASMs and the lozenge tilings is then an easy consequence of this result, which is obtained by specializing the generating functions to signed enumerations for both types of objects and then applying certain sign-reversing involutions. Another main result concerns the expansion of the multivariate generating function into symplectic characters as a sum over totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions, which is in perfect analogy to the situation for ordinary ASMs where the Schur expansion can be written as a sum over totally symmetric plane partitions. This is exciting as it is reminiscent of the well-known Cauchy identity, and the Cauchy identity does have a bijective proof using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence, and thus the result raises the question of whether there is a variation of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence that does eventually lead to a bijective proof.</description>

      <title>On Distinct Angles in the Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $N$ points lie in convex position in the plane then they determine $N^{1+ 3/23-o(1)}$ distinct angles, provided the points do not lie on a common circle. This is the first super-linear bound on the distinct angles problem that has received recent attention. This is derived from a more general claim that if $N$ points in the convex position in the real plane determine $KN$ distinct angles, then $K=\Omega(N^{1/4})$ or $\Omega(N/K)$ points are co-circular. The proof makes use of the implicit order one can give to points in convex position, recently used by Solymosi. Convex position also allows us to divide our set into two large ordered pieces. We use the squeezing lemma and the level sets of repeated angles to estimate the number of angles formed between these pieces. We obtain the main theorem using Stevens and Warren's convexity versus sum-set bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a powerful tool for embedding any tree poset $P$ of height $k$ in the Boolean lattice which allows us to solve several open problems in the area. We show that:
  * If $H$ is a family in $B_n$ with $|H|\ge (q-1+\varepsilon){n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}$ for some $q\ge k$, then $H$ contains on the order of as many induced copies of $P$ as is contained in the $q$ middle layers of the Boolean lattice. This generalizes results of Bukh and of Boehnlein and Jiang which guaranteed a single such copy in non-induced and induced settings respectively.
  * The number of induced $P$-free families of $B_n$ is $2^{(k-1+o(1)){n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}}$, strengthening recent independent work of Balogh, Garcia, Wigal who obtained the same bounds in the non-induced setting.
  * The largest induced $P$-free subset of a $p$-random subset of $B_n$ for $p\gg n^{-1}$ has size at most $(k-1+o(1))p{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}$, generalizing previous work of Balogh, Mycroft, and Treglown and of Collares and Morris for the case when $P$ is a chain.
  All three results are asymptotically tight and give affirmative answers to general conjectures of Gerbner, Nagy, Patk\'os, and Vizer in the case of tree posets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of a graph $G$ is the difference $\lambda_1 - \lambda_n$ between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Breen, Riasanovsky, Tait and Urschel recently determined the graph on $n$ vertices with maximum spread for sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we study a related question of maximizing the difference $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_{n-j}$ for a given pair $(i, j)$ over all graphs on $n$ vertices. We give upper bounds for all pairs $(i, j)$, exhibit an infinite family of pairs where the bound is tight, and show that for the pair $(1, 0)$ the extremal example is unique. These results contribute to a line of inquiry pioneered by Nikiforov aiming to maximize different linear combinations of eigenvalues over all graphs on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose the indicator function of each $(a, b)$-Catalan matroid polytope as a weighted sum of indicator function of matroid polytopes that correspond to direct sums of uniform matroids. Catalan matroids lie in the interior of the convex hull of direct sums of uniform matroids in the polytope of all matroids introduced by Ferroni and Fink. Moreover, we describe combinatorially the coefficients of the convex combination of direct sums of uniform matroid corresponding to an $(a,b)$-Catalan matroid. In particular, this allows us to derive explicit formulas for arbitrary valuative invariants of $(a, b)$-Catalan matroids. Among other applications, we prove that $(a,b)$-Catalan matroids are Ehrhart positive, and we find formulas for the Kazhdan--Lusztig invariants of these matroids.</description>

Abstract: We consider a derivation $\mathsf{D}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions and investigate its combinatorial, algebraic and geometric properties. More precisely, we show that $\mathsf{D}$ restricts to a quasi-isometry, with respect to the Hall product, on the graded component of $\Lambda$ of each positive degree and provide a chain-rule formula with respect to the plethysm operation. Furthermore, we relate the geometry of the Schur functions supporting $\mathsf{D}(f)$, where $f\in \Lambda$ is an homogeneous symmetric function, to that of $f$.</description>

      <title>Goodman-Strauss theorem revisited</title>

Abstract: The Goodman-Strauss theorem states that for ``almost every" substitution, the family of substitution tilings is sofic, that is, it can be defined by local rules for some decoration of tiles. The conditions on the substitution that guarantee the soficity are not stated explicitly, but are scattered throughout the proof.
  In this paper we propose a version of Goodman-Strauss theorem in which the conditions on the substitution are stated explicitly. Although the conditions are quite restrictive, we show that, in combination with two simple tricks (taking a sufficiently large power of the substitution and combining small tiles into larger ones), our version of Goodman-Strauss theorem can also prove the soficity of the family of substitution tilings for ``almost every'' substitution.
  We also prove a similar theorem for the family of hierarchical tilings associated with the given substitution. A tiling is called hierarchical if it has a composition under the substitution, such that this composition also has a composition, and so on, infinitely many times. Every substitution tiling is hierarchical, but the converse is not always true. Fernique and Ollinger formulated some conditions on the substitution that guarantee that the family of hierarchical tilings is sofic. However, their technique does not prove this statement under such general conditions as in their paper. In the present paper, we show that under the same assumptions, as for our version of the Goodman-Strauss theorem, their technique works.</description>

      <title>On generating sets of left-compressed intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a left-compressed family F(n, k, G) generated by a collection of generating sets G, and identify conditions on G under which F(n, k, G) is an intersecting family. From this, we obtain a convenient method to construct left-compressed intersecting families. After that, we provide some comparisons between the theorem of Bond and our result. Finally, we present some results on the generators of a maximal left-compressed intersecting family.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for matching cut problems in graphs without long induced paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph, a (perfect) matching cut is an edge cut that is a (perfect) matching. Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022, Algorithmica 2023)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced 14-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{15}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{19}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs (graphs without chordless cycles of length at least 9), it is hard to distinguish between those without matching cuts (respectively, perfect matching cuts, disconnected perfect matchings) and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs.
  On the positive side, we show that, as for MC [Moshi (JGT 1989)], DPM and PMC are polynomially solvable when restricted to 4-chordal graphs. Together with the negative results, this partly answers an open question on the complexity of PMC in $k$-chordal graphs asked in [Le, Telle (WG 2021, TCS 2022) &amp; Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (MFCS 2023, TCS 2024)].</description>

      <title>Word Measures on Wreath Products II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</description>

      <title>Wreath Macdonald polynomials, quiver varieties, and quasimap counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Codes for Random Access in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective and reliable data retrieval is critical for the feasibility of DNA storage, and the development of random access efficiency plays a key role in its practicality and reliability. In this paper, we study the Random Access Problem, which asks to compute the expected number of samples one needs in order to recover an information strand. Unlike previous work, we took a geometric approach to the problem, aiming to understand which geometric structures lead to codes that perform well in terms of reducing the random access expectation (Balanced Quasi-Arcs). As a consequence, two main results are obtained. The first is a construction for $k=3$ that outperforms previous constructions aiming to reduce the random access expectation. The second, exploiting a result from~\cite{gruica2024reducing}, is the proof of a conjecture from~\cite{bar2023cover} for rate $1/2$ codes in any dimension.</description>

      <title>A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one. Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound. We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing problem.</description>

      <title>Cantor digraphs and abbreviations of formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A digraph $D=\langle V,E\rangle$ ($E\subset V\times V$) is Cantor if Cantor's theorem - for no set there is a surjection from it to its power set - holds in $D$, in the sense we explain. We construct a ZF formula $\varphi$ with length $494$ such that $D\models\varphi$ iff $D$ is Cantor. In order to obtain $\varphi$, which is a word over the alphabet $$ \{x_1,\,x_2,\,\dots\}\cup \{\in,\,=,\,\neg, \,\to,\,\leftrightarrow,\,\wedge,\, \vee,\,\exists,\,\forall,\,(,\,)\}\,, $$ we devise abbreviation schemes of ZF formulas. We introduce extensive and strongly extensive digraphs and show, by the standard argument, that they are Cantor. We construct a countable strongly extensive digraph with arbitrarily large finite in-degrees.</description>
