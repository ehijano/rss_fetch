      <title>Functional classification of metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres are capable of displaying diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the fundamental subspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.</description>

      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and with a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>

      <title>A deep graph model for the signed interaction prediction in biological network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting signed interactions in biological networks is crucial for understanding drug mechanisms and facilitating drug repurposing. While deep graph models have demonstrated success in modeling complex biological systems, existing approaches often fail to distinguish between positive and negative interactions, limiting their utility for precise pharmacological predictions. In this study, we propose a novel deep graph model, \textbf{RGCNTD} (Relational Graph Convolutional Network with Tensor Decomposition), designed to predict both polar (e.g., activation, inhibition) and non-polar (e.g., binding, affect) chemical-gene interactions. Our model integrates graph convolutional networks with tensor decomposition to enhance feature representation and incorporates a conflict-aware sampling strategy to resolve polarity ambiguities. We introduce new evaluation metrics, \textit{AUC\textsubscript{polarity}} and \textit{CP@500}, to assess the model's ability to differentiate interaction types. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{RGCNTD} outperforms baseline models, achieving superior classification accuracy and improved discrimination of polar edges. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of subgraph components on predictive performance, revealing that additional network structures do not always enhance accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of polarity-aware modeling in drug discovery and network pharmacology, providing a robust framework for predicting complex biological interactions.</description>

      <title>Approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis for a Class of Two-Timescale Systems, with Application to Biological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) is an exciting framework used for control of safety-critical systems with nonlinear and possibly uncertain dynamics. However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</description>
