      <title>A Control Theory inspired Exploration Method for a Linear Bandit driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment, we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-Driven Control for Nonlinear Systems Using their Digital Twins and Quadratic Funnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a robust data-driven approach for the safe deployment of systems with nonlinear dynamics using their imperfect digital twins. Our contribution involves proposing a method that fuses the digital twin's nominal trajectory with online, data-driven uncertainty quantification to synthesize robust tracking controllers. Specifically, we derive data-driven bounds to capture the deviations of the actual system from its prescribed nominal trajectory informed via its digital twin. Subsequently, the dataset is used in the synthesis of quadratic funnels -- robust positive invariant tubes around the nominal trajectory -- via linear matrix inequalities built on the time-series data. The resulting controller guarantees constraint satisfaction while adapting to the true system behavior through a segmented learning strategy, where each segment's controller is synthesized using uncertainty information from the previous segment. This work establishes a systematic framework for obtaining safety certificates in learning-based control of nonlinear systems with imperfect models.</description>

      <title>A New Partial State-Feedback IDA-PBC for Two-Dimensional Nonlinear Systems: Application to Power Converters with Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a variation of the widely popular Interconnection-and-Damping-Assigment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) based on Poincare's Lemma to design output feedback globally stabilizing controllers for two dimensional systems. The procedure is constructive and, in comparison with the classical IDA-PBC, whose application is often stymied by the need to solve the (infamous) matching partial differential equation (PDE), in this new method the PDE is replaced by an ordinary differential equation, whose solution is far simpler. The procedure is then applied for the design of voltage-feedback controllers for the three most typical DC-to-DC power converter topologies: the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost. It is assumed that these converters feed an uncertain load, which is characterized by a static relation between its voltage and current. In the case when the load consists of the parallel connection of a resistive term and a constant power load we propose an adaptive version of the design, adding an identification scheme for the load parameters. This allows the controller to regulate the converter output when the load varies-that is a typical scenario in these applications. Extensive numerical simulations and experimental results validate the approach.</description>

      <title>Comparative Field Deployment of Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control for Residential HVAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana. This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable HVAC control solution.</description>

      <title>A Robust Neural Control Design for Multi-drone Slung Payload Manipulation with Control Contraction Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung payload transportation system to track a reference path under external disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated trajectories under external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning with Anytime Safety Guarantees via Robust Safe Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained reinforcement learning (RL) problems with anytime guarantees, meaning that the algorithmic solution must yield a constraint-satisfying policy at every iteration of its evolution. Our design is based on a discretization of the Robust Safe Gradient Flow (RSGF), a continuous-time dynamics for anytime constrained optimization whose forward invariance and stability properties we formally characterize. The proposed strategy, termed RSGF-RL, is an off-policy algorithm which uses episodic data to estimate the value functions and their gradients and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. Our technical analysis combines statistical analysis, the theory of stochastic approximation, and convex analysis to determine the number of episodes sufficient to ensure that safe policies are updated to safe policies and to recover from an unsafe policy, both with an arbitrary user-specified probability, and to establish the asymptotic convergence to the set of KKT points of the RL problem almost surely. Simulations on a navigation example and the cart-pole system illustrate the superior performance of RSGF-RL with respect to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Design Approach to Resilient Architectures for Interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems: Safety Guarantees under Multiple Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected rooms under different attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stability and Robustness of Time-Varying Opinion Dynamics: A Graph-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of opinion dynamics in the time-varying Friedkin-Johnsen (TVFJ) model, which captures both persistent individual biases and adaptive social influence. We introduce two temporal structures, defected temporal graphs (DTGs) and weakly defected temporal graphs (WDTGs), that serve as graph-theoretic certificates linking stubborn influence and temporal connectivity to contraction of the state-transition matrix. Using these tools, we prove asymptotic stability of TVFJ dynamics under infinitely recurring DTGs, exponential stability in semi-periodic defected networks, and asymptotic stability of a trust-based extension under the weaker condition of recurring WDTGs. We also establish boundedness of the omega-limit set, showing that long-run opinions remain within the convex hull of innate beliefs, and characterize the limit set for periodically switching systems via a p-LTI decomposition with the tight bound that the size of the omega-limit set is at most p. Finally, we show that exponential stability persists under bounded perturbations, ensuring robustness in noisy or imperfect networks. These results unify algebraic contraction tests with interpretable graph-based reasoning, providing scalable and resilient tools for analyzing opinion formation in evolving social and human-AI networks.</description>

      <title>A TSO-DSO Coordination Framework via Analytical Representation and Monetization of PQV-Based Distribution System Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the role of distribution system (DS) flexibility in transmission system operator (TSO) network management becomes increasingly vital, data privacy concerns hinder seamless interoperability. The notion of the feasible operating region (FOR), defined in the PQ domain, has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving approach. However, effectively leveraging FOR in TSO operations remains challenging due to three key factors: its accurate determination in large-scale, meshed DS networks; its tractable analytical representation; and its economic valuation. In the present paper, we propose a novel AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based method to construct a three-dimensional PQV-FOR, explicitly accounting for voltage variability and diverse flexibility-providing unit (FPU) characteristics. The construction process employs a two-stage sampling strategy that combines bounding box projection and Fibonacci direction techniques to efficiently capture the FOR. We then introduce an implicit polynomial fitting approach to analytically represent the FOR. Furthermore, we derive a quadratic cost function over the PQV domain to monetize the FOR. Thus, the proposed framework enables single-round TSO-DSO coordination: the DSO provides an analytical FOR and cost model; the TSO determines operating point at the point of common coupling (PCC) within the FOR-based AC-OPF; and the DSO computes FPU dispatch by solving its local OPF, without computationally intensive disaggregation or iterative coordination. Case studies on meshed DS with up to 533 buses, integrated into TS, demonstrates the method's efficiency compared to standard AC-OPF. On average, the proposed approach yields negligible cost deviations of at most 0.058% across test cases, while reducing computation times by up to 58.11%.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Car-following Using Distributed MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the modeling framework of Markov games, we propose a series of algorithms for coordinated car-following using distributed model predictive control (DMPC). Instead of tracking prescribed feasible trajectories, driving policies are solved directly as outcomes of the DMPC optimization given the driver's perceivable states. The coordinated solutions are derived using the best response dynamics via iterated self-play, and are facilitated by direct negotiation using inter-agent or agent-infrastructure communication. These solutions closely approximate either Nash equilibrium or centralized optimization. By re-parameterizing the action sequence in DMPC as a curve along the planning horizon, we are able to systematically reduce the original DMPC to very efficient grid searches such that the optimal solution to the original DMPC can be well executed in real-time. Within our modeling framework, it is natural to cast traffic control problems as mechanism design problems, in which all agents are endogenized on an equal footing with full incentive compatibility. We show how traffic efficiency can be dramatically improved while keeping stop-and-go phantom waves tamed at high vehicle densities. Our approach can be viewed as an alternative way to formulate coordinated adaptive cruise control (CACC) without an explicit platooning (or with all vehicles in the traffic system treated as a single extended platoon). We also address the issue of linear stability of the associated discrete-time traffic dynamics and demonstrate why it does not always tell the full story about the traffic stability.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered control and communication for single-master multi-slave teleoperation systems with Try-Once-Discard protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-master multi-slave (SMMS) teleoperation systems can perform multiple tasks remotely in a shorter time, cover large-scale areas, and adapt more easily to single-point failures, thereby effectively encompassing a broader range of applications. As the number of slave manipulators sharing a communication network increases, the limitation of communication bandwidth becomes critical. To alleviate bandwidth usage, the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) scheduling protocol and event-triggered mechanisms are often employed separately. In this paper, we combine both strategies to optimize network bandwidth and energy consumption for SMMS teleoperation systems. Specifically, we propose event-triggered control and communication schemes for a class of SMMS teleoperation systems using the TOD scheduling protocol. Considering dynamic uncertainties, the unavailability of relative velocities, and time-varying delays, we develop adaptive controllers with virtual observers based on event-triggered schemes to achieve master-slave synchronization. Stability criteria for the SMMS teleoperation systems under these event-triggered control and communication schemes are established, demonstrating that Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Guidance for Aerial Defense in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Control Barrier Functions: A Path Towards Nonparametric Safety Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of complex dynamical systems often relies on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Both methods require computing a function that characterizes a safe set that can be made (control) invariant. However, the computational burden of solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (for HJ Reachability) or large-scale semidefinite programs (for CBFs) makes finding such functions challenging. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Recurrent Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs), a novel class of CBFs that leverages a recurrent property of the trajectories, i.e., coming back to a safe set, for safety verification. Under mild assumptions, we show that the RCBF condition holds for the signed-distance function, turning function design into set identification. Notably, the resulting set need not be invariant to certify safety. We further propose a data-driven nonparametric method to compute safe sets that is massively parallelizable and trades off conservativeness against computational cost.</description>

      <title>Detection and Identification of Sensor Attacks Using Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate data-driven attack detection and identification in a model-free setting. Unlike existing studies, we consider the case where the available output data include malicious false-data injections. We aim to detect and identify such attacks solely from the compromised data. We address this problem in two scenarios: (1) when the system operator is aware of the system's sparse observability condition, and (2) when the data are partially clean (i.e., attack-free). In both scenarios, we derive conditions and algorithms for detecting and identifying attacks using only the compromised data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via numerical simulations on a three-inertia system.</description>

      <title>Computing Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions: Softmax Relaxation and Smooth Patching with Formal Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control barrier and control Lyapunov functions (CBF-CLF) guarantees the existence of such a function on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. To maximize the certifiable safe domain while retaining differentiability, we employ a log-sum-exp (softmax) relaxation of the nonsmooth maximum barrier, together with a counterexample-guided refinement that inserts half-space cuts until a strict barrier condition is verifiable. We then patch the softmax barrier with a CLF via an explicit smooth bump construction, which is always feasible under the strict compatibility condition. All conditions are formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, enabled by a reformulation of Farkas' lemma for encoding strict compatibility. On benchmark systems, including a power converter, we show that the certified safe stabilization regions obtained with the proposed approach are often less conservative than those achieved by state-of-the-art sum-of-squares (SOS) compatible CBF-CLF designs.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic Social Distancing in Competitive Bi-Virus SIS Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous elements drive the spread of infectious diseases in complex real-world networks. Of particular interest is social behaviors that evolve in tandem with the spread of disease. Moreover, recent studies highlight the importance of understanding how multiple strains spread simultaneously through a population (e.g. Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2). In this paper, we propose a bi-virus SIS epidemic model coupled with a game-theoretic social distancing behavior model. The behaviors are governed by replicator equations from evolutionary game theory. The prevalence of each strain impacts the choice of an individual to social distance, and, in turn, their behavior affects the spread of each virus in the SIS model. Our analysis identifies equilibria of the system and their local stability properties, which reveal several isolated fixed points with varying levels of social distancing. We find that endemic co-existence is possible only when the reproduction numbers of both strains are equal. Assuming the reproduction number for each virus is the same, we identify suitable parameter regimes that give rise to lines of coexistence equilibria. Moreover, we also identify conditions for local exponential stability of said lines of equilibria. We illustrate our findings with several numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generating Differentially Private Networks with a Modified Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy has been used to privately calculate numerous network properties, but existing approaches often require the development of a new privacy mechanism for each property of interest. Therefore, we present a framework for generating entire networks in a differentially private way. Differential privacy is immune to post-processing, which allows for any network property to be computed and analyzed for a private output network, without weakening its protections. We consider undirected networks and develop a differential privacy mechanism that takes in a sensitive network and outputs a private network by randomizing its edge set. We prove that this mechanism does provide differential privacy to a network's edge set, though it induces a complex distribution over the space of output graphs. We then develop an equivalent privacy implementation using a modified Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model that constructs an output graph edge by edge, and it is efficient and easily implementable, even on large complex networks. Experiments implement $\varepsilon$-differential privacy with $\varepsilon=2.5$ when computing graph Laplacian spectra, and these results show the proposed mechanism incurs $49.34\%$ less error than the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.</description>

      <title>Integrated Security Mechanisms for Weight Protection in Memristive Crossbar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised. Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>DeMuon: A Decentralized Muon for Matrix Optimization over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network topologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Collision Cones: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Nonholonomic Robots via Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered, dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary. The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.</description>

      <title>Touching the tumor boundary: A pilot study on ultrasound based virtual fixtures for breast-conserving surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our guidance system.</description>

      <title>Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning: Learning Control Policies from Corrupted Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).</description>

      <title>Adversarial Social Influence: Modeling Persuasion in Contested Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Social Influence Game (SIG), a framework for modeling adversarial persuasion in social networks with an arbitrary number of competing players. Our goal is to provide a tractable and interpretable model of contested influence that scales to large systems while capturing the structural leverage points of networks. Each player allocates influence from a fixed budget to steer opinions that evolve under DeGroot dynamics, and we prove that the resulting optimization problem is a difference-of-convex program. To enable scalability, we develop an Iterated Linear (IL) solver that approximates player objectives with linear programs. In experiments on random and archetypical networks, IL achieves solutions within 7% of nonlinear solvers while being over 10x faster, scaling to large social networks. This paper lays a foundation for asymptotic analysis of contested influence in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Pose Estimation of a Thruster-Driven Bioinspired Multi-Link Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints, link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning) performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across multiple gaits.</description>

      <title>Bi-Virus SIS Epidemic Propagation under Mutation and Game-theoretic Protection Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which individuals are either susceptible or infected with one of two virus strains, and consider mutation-driven transitions between strains. The general case of bi-directional mutation is first analyzed, where we characterize the disease-free equilibrium and establish its global asymptotic stability, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We then present a game-theoretic framework where susceptible individuals strategically choose whether to adopt protection or remain unprotected, to maximize their instantaneous payoffs. We derive Nash strategies under bi-directional mutation, and subsequently consider the special case of unidirectional mutation. In the latter case, we show that coexistence of both strains is impossible when mutation occurs from the strain with lower reproduction number and transmission rate to the other strain. Furthermore, we fully characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE) in the setting permitting coexistence, and examine how mutation rates influence protection adoption and infection prevalence at the SNE. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating that infection levels decrease monotonically with higher protection adoption, and highlight the impact of mutation rates and protection cost on infection state trajectories.</description>

      <title>Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Magnetic Continuum Robot for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields. Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release. Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.</description>

      <title>Robust MPC for Large-scale Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and &lt;= 1.5% relative error (R^2 &gt;= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete hardware and firmware resources.</description>

      <title>Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development. However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.</description>

      <title>Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced, Data-Driven Personalized and Equitable Clinician Scheduling: A Predict-then-Optimize Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.</description>

      <title>On the (almost) Global Exponential Convergence of the Overparameterized Policy Optimization for the LQR Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the convergence of gradient methods for nonconvex optimization problems -- specifically the effect of the problem formulation to the convergence behavior of the solution of a gradient flow. We show through a simple example that, surprisingly, the gradient flow solution can be exponentially or asymptotically convergent, depending on how the problem is formulated. We then deepen the analysis and show that a policy optimization strategy for the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) (which is known to present only asymptotic convergence globally) presents almost global exponential convergence if the problem is overparameterized through a linear feed-forward neural network (LFFNN). We prove this qualitative improvement always happens for a simplified version of the LQR problem and derive explicit convergence rates for the gradient flow. Finally, we show that both the qualitative improvement and the quantitative rate gains persist in the general LQR through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Product Digital Twin Supporting End-of-life Phase of Electric Vehicle Batteries Utilizing Product-Process-Resource Asset Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However, manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and embedded devices in the past decade has introduced numerous challenges in terms of security and configuration management. Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.</description>

Abstract: Computing the similarity between two probability distributions is a recurring theme across control. We introduce a unified family of distances between the probability distributions of two random variables that is based on the discrepancy between the cumulative distribution functions of random linear one-dimensional projections of the random variables. Our proposed distance is interpretable, computationally simple, and admits a differentiable approximation. We establish asymptotic theoretical guarantees for sample-based estimators of the distance. We empirically study the use of the distance in a two-sample test and demonstrate its ability to distinguish different distributions. Finally, we show that the distance allows for simple gradient-based solutions in control by studying distribution steering and ergodic control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic levitation system (Maglev) is a nonlinear system by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. The main control perspective of the Maglev system is to levitate a steel ball in air by the electromagnetic force. However, the Maglev system has highly nonlinear dynamics which is inconvenient in the sense of sensitive control/regulation of its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, the nonlinear backstepping controller based on the fractional-order derivative is proposed for the control of the nonlinear current-controlled Maglev system. After, the system dynamics and fractional-order backstepping controller design are given, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved by employing the Lyapunov theory. Some computer-based numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the control of Maglev system.</description>

      <title>On the Standard Performance Criteria for Applied Control Design: PID, MPC or Machine Learning Controller?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional control theory and its application to basic and complex systems have reached an advanced level of maturity. This includes aerial, marine, and ground vehicles, as well as robotics, chemical, transportation, and electrical systems widely used in our daily lives. The emerging era of data-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers does not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it aims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly complex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities comparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge from computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control, producing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread real-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the presence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised metrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\&amp;V$) of algorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain aspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within the literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must satisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control effort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied perspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for testing and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students. The proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box algorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\&amp;V$ perspectives to prevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilization of Unknown Linear-Threshold Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the data-driven control of unknown linear-threshold network dynamics to stabilize the state to a reference value. We consider two types of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward reference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error integration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to design, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system parameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input datasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics. Since these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them as switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding a common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller gain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and propose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with the system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of firing rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs.</description>

Abstract: When gradient-based methods are impractical, black-box optimization (BBO) provides a valuable alternative. However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Bottleneck: An Algorithm-Agnostic Framework of Computation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing a control sequence requires computation. While this is a simple observation, developing a framework that relates a controller's required computation to its ability to successfully control a system (e.g. lower control cost) is challenging, especially when the controller appears on alternative compute platforms (e.g. biological neural networks). More specifically, we want a framework where, given an observed closed-loop trajectory, we can quantify the computation effort needed to produce that trajectory. To enable effective comparisons of closed-loop systems across alternative compute platforms, we present the Path Integral Bottleneck (PI-IB), a method to produce an analytical, algorithm-agnostic description of the compute-control relationship. With the PI-IB framework, we can plot tradeoffs between performance and computation effort for any given plant description and control cost function. Simulations of the cart-pole reveal fundamental control-compute tradeoffs, exposing regions where the task performance-per-compute is higher than others.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Limit of the Output of IIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the output of a stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system driven by a non-Gaussian stochastic input. Motivated by longstanding heuristics in the stochastic describing function method, we rigorously characterize when the output process becomes approximately Gaussian, even when the input is not. Using the Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds on the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal distribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend explicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the input process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the edge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) independence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole, or (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard normal distribution at rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples where convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of low-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian.</description>

      <title>A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.</description>

      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>

      <title>Continuous Wrist Control on the Hannes Prosthesis: a Vision-based Shared Autonomy Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

      <title>Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output and utilisation is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm for capacity expansion planning if only uncertain data is available for a year's operative parameters. When faced with multiple possible operating years, the quality of a solution derived on a single operating year's data is evaluated for all years, and the optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of cold dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany for 40 different operating years shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered years increasing the total annual cost by 1.6-2.9% compared to a lower bound. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time-series, combining dark lull and cold period effects.</description>

      <title>AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>

      <title>Time-o1: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training time-series forecast models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/Time-o1.</description>
