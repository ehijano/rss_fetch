      <title>Simulation of a mathematical model of tumoral growth using finite differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presents a study of the non-linear mathematical model of tumor growth, proposed by Kolev and Zubik-Kowal (2011). The model is described by a system composed of four partial differential equations that represent the evolution of the density of cancer cells, density of the extracellular matrix (ECM), concentration of matrix-degrading enzyme (MDE) and concentration of tissue metalloproteinase inhibitors. For numerical simulations, the finite difference method is used, in which the temporal terms of the equations are discretized using a two-stage method. In spatial terms, finite central differences are used. A study of numerical convergence for the proposed scheme is presented, using analytical solutions manufactured in a rectangular geometry. Finally, simulations of the tumor growth model are performed, using a non-regular mesh that represents the geometry of a female breast. To simulate the model in non-regular geometry, the technique used is to approximate the contour of the physical domain by mesh segments. The simulations showed that the model has important characteristics of the interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding tissue.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Role of Aerosol and Exudate Transport in the Diffusion of Lung Infection in Respiratory Infectious Diseases (taking SARS-CoV-2 as an example): A Hypothesis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hypothetical model for the dual role of respiratory aerosols and inflammatory exudates in the dynamics and progression of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Starting from a new paradigm in infectious disease transmission, we reflect on the often-overlooked role of physical transmission media within the host individual. The hypothesis posits that tiny aerosols (including those inhaled externally and those self-generated and re-inhaled by the host) play a crucial role in the initial seeding and early expansion of the infection in the lungs, explaining the multifocal characteristics observed in early CT imaging. As the infection progresses, inflammatory exudates, formed due to lung inflammation, become a new efficient vehicle, driving the large-scale spread of the virus within the lungs and accounting for the development of diffuse lesions. This model reveals a "dynamic equilibrium point" where the dominant mechanism shifts from aerosol-mediated to exudate-mediated spread. Although direct validation of this hypothesis faces ethical and technical challenges, existing clinical imaging, viral kinetics, and epidemiological patterns provide indirect support. The paper also conceptualizes ideal experimental designs and retrospective analyses to validate the hypothesis. Finally, we discuss the implications of this hypothesis for public health practice, emphasizing the importance of improving ventilation in the microenvironment of infected individuals to achieve a "for all, by all" (literally "everyone for me, I for everyone") bidirectional protection. This research aims to provide a new framework for understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory infectious diseases and to offer theoretical basis for developing more cost-effective and broadly applicable intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies four independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.</description>
