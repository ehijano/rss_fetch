      <title>Efficient design of rna sequences with desired properties, structure, and motifs using a grammar variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing structurally stable RNA sequences with specific motifs and other desirable properties is an important challenge in bioinformatics. The potential design space increases exponentially with the length of the RNA to be engineered, which makes this a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an RNA grammar variational autoencoder (RGVAE) that can efficiently generate novel RNA sequences with specific target properties. The proposed RGVAE builds on the recently proposed grammar VAE, where we incorporate the stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) to design strutural RNAs with desired motifs and characteristics. Using the SCFG can ensure that the generated RNA sequence can form a thermodynamically stable secondary structure. Given a RNA sequence, the SCFT is used to find the parse tree, which is represented in a continuous low-dimensional latent space by the RGVAE encoder. We can optimize the RNA in the latent space, where the latent representation can be decoded by the RGVAE decoder to reconstruct the RNA sequence. Based on a number of practical uses cases, we demonstrate that RGVAE can be used to efficiently design structurally stable RNAs with specific target properties, which significantly outperform other alternatives such as randomized design and regular VAEs that do not utilize the SCFG. Code availability: the source code of RGVAE and the data used in this study are provided in https://github.com/nzarnaghinaghsh/RGVAE/tree/main, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15569206.</description>

      <title>Decoding Translation-Related Functional Sequences in 5'UTRs Using Interpretable Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) regulate mRNA translation is critical for controlling protein expression and designing effective therapeutic mRNAs. While recent deep learning models have shown promise in predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences, most are constrained by fixed input lengths and limited interpretability. We introduce UTR-STCNet, a Transformer-based architecture for flexible and biologically grounded modeling of variable-length 5'UTRs. UTR-STCNet integrates a Saliency-Aware Token Clustering (SATC) module that iteratively aggregates nucleotide tokens into multi-scale, semantically meaningful units based on saliency scores. A Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block then captures both local and distal regulatory dependencies using a lightweight attention mechanism. This combined architecture achieves efficient and interpretable modeling without input truncation or increased computational cost. Evaluated across three benchmark datasets, UTR-STCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting mean ribosome load (MRL), a key proxy for translational efficiency. Moreover, the model recovers known functional elements such as upstream AUGs and Kozak motifs, highlighting its potential for mechanistic insight into translation regulation.</description>

      <title>Autonomic Arousal in Social Anxiety: An Electrodermal Activity Study During an Emotionally Salient Cognitive Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with heightened physiological arousal in social-evaluative contexts, but it remains unclear whether such autonomic reactivity extends to non-evaluative cognitive stressors. This study investigated electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns in socially anxious (SA) and non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals during an emotionally salient 2-back working memory task using facial expressions. 50 participants (25 SA, 25 NSA) completed both a baseline rest period and the task while EDA data were collected via the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor. A range of EDA features, such as tonic and phasic components, number and amplitude of skin conductance responses, and sympathetic activation estimates, were analyzed using a standardized, interval-based approach. Results revealed significant increases in EDA across all participants from baseline to task, indicating elevated autonomic arousal during cognitive load. However, no significant group differences were found between SA and NSA individuals. These findings suggest that cognitive-emotional stress, in the absence of social-evaluative threat, elicits comparable physiological responses regardless of social anxiety status. The results underscore the context-dependent nature of anxiety-related autonomic reactivity and advocate for the inclusion of social-evaluative or recovery phases in future research to detect more nuanced group effects.</description>

      <title>Learning Patient-Specific Spatial Biomarker Dynamics via Operator Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response. Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging, biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions, simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90% across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches. This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Point Clouds for Learning Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task, and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD) is a de-identified resource derived from electronic health records (EHR) that facilitates research in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ARMD encompasses big data from adult patients collected from over 15 years at two academic-affiliated hospitals, focusing on microbiological cultures, antibiotic susceptibilities, and associated clinical and demographic features. Key attributes include organism identification, susceptibility patterns for 55 antibiotics, implied susceptibility rules, and de-identified patient information. This dataset supports studies on antimicrobial stewardship, causal inference, and clinical decision-making. ARMD is designed to be reusable and interoperable, promoting collaboration and innovation in combating AMR. This paper describes the dataset's acquisition, structure, and utility while detailing its de-identification process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cognition Machine Learning for Forecasting Chromosomal Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to analyze dynamically changing brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components through the Hodge decomposition. We propose to quantify the magnitude and relative strength of each component. We performed extensive simulation studies with known ground truth. The Hodge decomposition is then applied to the dynamically changing human brain networks obtained from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Our results indicate that the components of the Hodge decomposition contain biologically interpretable topological features that provide statistically significant findings not easily captured by traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Now and Future of Artificial Intelligence-based Signet Ring Cell Diagnosis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signet ring cells (SRCs), associated with a high propensity for peripheral metastasis and poor prognosis, critically influence surgical decision-making and outcome prediction. However, their detection remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Validation of contact mechanics models for Atomic Force Microscopy via Finite Elements Analysis and nanoindentation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

      <title>BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16660v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</description>

      <title>Protein folding classes -- High-dimensional geometry of amino acid composition space revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which are superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-\`a-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and limits in classification). Intended principally as accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where permissible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.</description>

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>
