      <title>Quasi-invariant measures concentrating on countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Countable $\mathcal{L}$-structures $\mathcal{N}$ whose isomorphism class supports a permutation invariant probability measure in the logic action have been characterized by Ackerman-Freer-Patel to be precisely those $\mathcal{N}$ which have no algebraicity. Here we characterize those countable $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\mathcal{N}$ whose isomorphism class supports a quasi-invariant probability measure. These turn out to be precisely those $\mathcal{N}$ which are not "highly algebraic" -- we say that $\mathcal{N}$ is highly algebraic if outside of every finite $F$ there is some $b$ and a tuple $\bar{a}$ disjoint from $b$ so that $b$ has a finite orbit under the pointwise stabilizer of $\bar{a}$ in $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{N})$. As a bi-product of our proof we show that whenever the isomorphism class of $\mathcal{N}$ admits a quasi-invariant measure, then it admits one with continuous Radon--Nikodym cocycles.</description>

      <title>Queries With Exact Truth Values in Paraconsistent Description Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07283v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to querying classical inconsistent description logic (DL) knowledge bases by adopting a~paraconsistent semantics with the four Belnapian values: exactly true ($\mathbf{T}$), exactly false ($\mathbf{F}$), both ($\mathbf{B}$), and neither ($\mathbf{N}$). In contrast to prior studies on paraconsistent DLs, we allow truth value operators in the query language, which can be used to differentiate between answers having contradictory evidence and those having only positive evidence. We present a reduction to classical DL query answering that allows us to pinpoint the precise combined and data complexity of answering queries with values in paraconsistent $\mathcal{ALCHI}$ and its sublogics. Notably, we show that tractable data complexity is retained for Horn DLs. We present a comparison with repair-based inconsistency-tolerant semantics, showing that the two approaches are incomparable.</description>

      <title>Abductive Reasoning in a Paraconsistent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the problem of explaining observations starting from a classically inconsistent theory by adopting a paraconsistent framework. We consider two expansions of the well-known Belnap--Dunn paraconsistent four-valued logic $\mathsf{BD}$: $\mathsf{BD}_\circ$ introduces formulas of the form $\circ\phi$ (the information on $\phi$ is reliable), while $\mathsf{BD}_\triangle$ augments the language with $\triangle\phi$'s (there is information that $\phi$ is true). We define and motivate the notions of abduction problems and explanations in $\mathsf{BD}_\circ$ and $\mathsf{BD}_\triangle$ and show that they are not reducible to one another. We analyse the complexity of standard abductive reasoning tasks (solution recognition, solution existence, and relevance / necessity of hypotheses) in both logics. Finally, we show how to reduce abduction in $\mathsf{BD}_\circ$ and $\mathsf{BD}_\triangle$ to abduction in classical propositional logic, thereby enabling the reuse of existing abductive reasoning procedures.</description>

      <title>A logical limit law for the sequential model of preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random graphs, the limit law we refer to is the existence of a limiting probability of any graph property that can be expressed in terms of predicate logic. A zero-one limit law is shown by Shelah and Spencer for Erd\"{o}s-Renyi graphs given that the connection rate has an irrational exponent. We show a limit law for preferential attachment graphs which admit a P\'{o}lya urn representation. The two extreme cases of the parametric model, the uniform attachment graph and the sequential Barab\'{a}si-Albert model, are covered separately as they exhibit qualitative differences regarding the distribution of cycles of bounded length in the graph.</description>

      <title>On the computational properties of basic mathematical notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the computational properties of basic mathematical notions pertaining to $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$-functions and subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, like finiteness, countability, (absolute) continuity, bounded variation, suprema, and regularity. We work in higher-order computability theory based on Kleene's S1-S9 schemes. We show that the aforementioned italicised properties give rise to two huge and robust classes of computationally equivalent operations, the latter based on well-known theorems from the mainstream mathematics literature. As part of this endeavour, we develop an equivalent $\lambda$-calculus formulation of S1-S9 that accommodates partial objects. We show that the latter are essential to our enterprise via the study of countably based and partial functionals of type $3$.</description>

      <title>The Weihrauch lattice at the level of $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1^1\mathsf{-CA}_0$: the Cantor-Bendixson theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the program connecting reverse mathematics and computable analysis via the framework of Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we consider problems related to perfect subsets of Polish spaces, studying the perfect set theorem, the Cantor-Bendixson theorem and various problems arising from them. In the framework of reverse mathematics these theorems are equivalent respectively to $\mathsf{ATR}_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1^1\mathsf{-CA}_0$, the two strongest subsystems of second order arithmetic among the so-called big five. As far as we know, this is the first systematic study of problems at the level of $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1^1\mathsf{-CA}_0$ in the Weihrauch lattice.
  We show that the strength of some of the problems we study depends on the topological properties of the Polish space under consideration, while others have the same strength once the space is rich enough.</description>

      <title>On some computational properties of open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open sets are central to mathematics, especially analysis and topology, in ways few notions are. In most, if not all, computational approaches to mathematics, open sets are only studied indirectly via their 'codes' or 'representations'. In this paper, we study how hard it is to compute, given an arbitrary open set of reals, the most common representation, i.e. a countable set of open intervals. We work in Kleene's higher-order computability theory, which was historically based on the S1-S9 schemes and which now has an intuitive lambda calculus formulation due to the authors. We establish many computational equivalences between on one hand the 'structure' functional that converts open sets to the aforementioned representation, and on the other hand functionals arising from mainstream mathematics, like basic properties of semi-continuous functions, the Urysohn lemma, and the Tietze extension theorem. We also compare these functionals to known operations on regulated and bounded variation functions, and the Lebesgue measure restricted to closed sets. We obtain a number of natural computational equivalences for the latter involving theorems from mainstream mathematics.</description>

      <title>A note on surjective cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, we write $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ if there are sets $A$ and $B$ of cardinalities $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, respectively, such that there are partial surjections from $A$ onto $B$ and from $B$ onto $A$. $=^\ast$-equivalence classes are called surjective cardinals. In this article, we show that $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}_\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is a fixed aleph, cannot prove that surjective cardinals form a cardinal algebra, which gives a negative solution to a question proposed by Truss [J. Truss, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 27, 165--207 (1984)]. Nevertheless, we show that surjective cardinals form a ``surjective cardinal algebra'', whose postulates are almost the same as those of a cardinal algebra, except that the refinement postulate is replaced by the finite refinement postulate. This yields a smoother proof of the cancellation law for surjective cardinals, which states that $m\cdot\mathfrak{a}=^\ast m\cdot\mathfrak{b}$ implies $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ for all cardinals $\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b}$ and all nonzero natural numbers $m$.</description>
