      <title>New Generalized Expressions for the Electromagnetic Fields of the Hybrid Modes of an Optical Fiber Using Complex and Bi-Complex Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic fields of the hybrid modes of an optical fiber are reformulated using bi-complex mathematics, which leads to simpler expressions relative to those found using the widely used, conventional complex method. Generalized expressions for the electromagnetic fields are also found using both methods, for comparative purposes. Furthermore, the feasibility of bi-complex mathematics is investigated for the derivation of the modal powers and the orthogonality relation.</description>

      <title>Formation of Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum in a Single Deformed Microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) holds significant promise in manipulating electromagnetic fields and reducing losses in optical structures, leading to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. Despite their observation in various optical systems, the behavior of BIC in whispering-gallery-modes (WGMs) optical microcavities, essential components of photonic integrated chips, has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, we propose and experimentally identify a robust mechanism for generating quasi-BIC in a single deformed microcavity. By introducing boundary deformations, we construct stable unidirectional radiation channels as leaking continuum shared by different resonant modes and experimentally verify their external strong mode coupling. This results in drastically suppressed leaking loss of one originally long-lived resonance, manifested as more than a 3-fold enhancement of its quality (Q) factor, while the other short-lived resonance becomes more lossy, demonstrating the formation of Friedrich-Wintgen quasi-BICs as corroborated by both the theoretical model and the experimental data. This research will provide a practical approach to enhance the Q factor of optical microcavities, opening up potential applications in the area of deformed microcavities, nonlinear optics, quantum optics, and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Scanning cavity OF-CEAS technique for rapid collection of high resolution spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified approach to laser optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy. The technique involves continuously scanning the length of a high-finesse cavity to periodically lock a diode laser to the cavity resonance, resulting in a discrete set of transmission measurements that are evenly spaced in frequency. For a fixed laser bias, data can be collected spanning a spectral bandwidth equivalent to the free-spectral range of the cavity, with spectral resolution inversely proportional to the distance from the laser to cavity. The center frequency of this scan can be tuned by tuning the free-running laser frequency. We demonstrate the concept using a fiber-coupled 1578-nm laser and a scanning Fabry-Perot cavity to measure a series of weak CO2 absorption lines with a frequency resolution of 15.6 MHz and a noise equivalent absorption coefficient of 10-7 cm-1, limited by the moderate finesse (~5000) and short length (~5 cm) of the cavity. Individual CO2 line shapes can be measured with high resolution in a single scan that takes 67 ms. The approach has a combination of characteristics that are advantageous for in situ instruments, such as small size, high spectral resolution, fast data collection, and minimal components.</description>

      <title>Programmable refractive functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As an experimental proof of concept, we demonstrate negative refractive function at the terahertz part of the spectrum using a 3D-printed material. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulating reflection-type all-dielectric non-local metasurfaces via parity of particle number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity of particle number is a new degree of freedom for manipulating metasurface, while its influence on controlling non-local metasurfaces remains an unresolved and intriguing question. We propose a metasurface consisting of periodically arranged infinite-long cylinders made from multiple layers of SiO2 and WS2. The cylinder exhibits strong backward scattering due to the overlapping magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole resonances. Without non-local coupling in unit cells, the infinite-size metasurface manifests high reflection across all instances. However, parity-dependent reflectivity diverges with non-local coupling in supercells, exhibiting either increased logarithmic or decreased exponential behavior, with significant distinctions at small particle numbers. Interestingly, equal magnitude reflection and transmission reversals are achievable through alternation between adjacent odd and even particle numbers. The finite-size non-local metasurfaces behave similarly to the infinite-size counterparts, yet high reflection disappears at small particle numbers due to energy leakage. Essentially, high reflection arises from strong backward scattering and effective suppression of lateral multiple scatterings. Our work aids in the actual metasurface design and sheds new light on photonic integrated circuits and on-chip optical communication.</description>

      <title>Optimal displacement detection of arbitrarily-shaped levitated dielectric objects using optical radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-levitated dielectric objects are promising for precision force, acceleration, torque, and rotation sensing due to their extreme environmental decoupling. While many levitated opto-mechanics experiments employ spherical objects, for some applications non-spherical geometries offer advantages. For example, rod-shaped or dumbbell shaped particles have been demonstrated for torque and rotation sensing and high aspect ratio plate-like particles can exhibit reduced photon recoil heating and may be useful for high-frequency gravitational wave detection or as high bandwidth accelerometers. To achieve optimal sensitivity, cooling, and quantum control in these systems, it is beneficial to achieve optimal displacement detection using scattered light. We describe and numerically implement a method based on Fisher information that is applicable to suspended particles of arbitrary geometry. We demonstrate the agreement between our method and prior methods employed for spherical particles, both in the Rayleigh and Lorentz-Mie regimes. As practical examples we analyze the optical detection limits of an optically-levitated high-aspect-ratio disc-like dielectric object and a rod-shaped object for configurations recently realized in experimental work.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~20 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~4 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Frequency stabilization via interference between transmitted and reflected lights from a reference cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modulation-free optical frequency stabilization technique using an interferometric effect between transmitted and reflected lights from a reference cavity. The property of the reflected light brings robustness of the error signal against laser intensity fluctuations as in previous stabilization methods. Due to the property of the transmitted light, the capture range for a specific locking frequency is expanded up to twice the FSR of the cavity, which we experimentally demonstrate. If locking to any resonant frequency is allowed, the capture range is infinite. From the effect of using both lights, our method achieves the highest sensitivity to the frequency fluctuations around the resonant frequency and provides robustness against the interferometer fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Simulating strong-field electron-hole dynamics in solids probed by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics of a model of a wide-bandgap material with inner, valence, and conduction bands excited by an intense few-femtosecond pump and monitored by a delayed attosecond extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse. Complementary computational methods are utilized and compared, based on the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). TDDFT is employed to study a finite-size system, while the SBEs are utilized to investigate the corresponding solid with periodic boundary conditions imposed, with the crystal-momentum-dependent energy bands and interband couplings calculated in the parallel-transport structure gauge. The resulting strong-field electron dynamics are employed to predict experimentally accessible attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) signals as a function of the probe-pulse frequency and pump-probe interpulse delay. Both simulation protocols similarly capture the time-delay-dependent spectral features in the ATAS signals. The very good agreement between our TDDFT and SBE-based results allows us to interpret the ab-initio TDDFT simulations in terms of SBEs' interband couplings, validating our SBE-based model and corroborating its conclusions.</description>

      <title>Wide angle tolerant solar spectral splitter for lateral tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing the power conversion efficiency of solar cells plays a crucial role in upscaling solar energy production. Combining two or more solar cells with different bandgaps into a multi-junction tandem solar cells lowers thermalization losses and increases the power conversion efficiency. Whilst the best efficiencies have been achieved by vertically stacking solar cells, the fabrication process is technologically demanding and leads to high production costs. Novel photovoltaic materials such as organic photovoltaics allow solution processing, which enables the cost effective production of lateral multijunctions, where the single subcells are aligned side by side. To fully unlock their optimal performance, lateral tandems require careful light management, redirecting different spectral bands to the corresponding solar cell. So far, solar spectral splitters suffered from a strong angle dependency, which caused a degradation in performance at the slightest deviation from normal incidence. In this contribution, we reduce this limitation and achieve an enhancement in the conversion efficiency across a wide range of incident angles by inverse designing a solar spectral splitter comprised of two free-form microstructured surfaces on the top and bottom of a supporting glass substrate. Moreover, thanks to the versatility of our methodology, we can tailor the angle-dependent functionality of our device. As such, we also design devices that are optimized to provide enhanced performance at certain oblique angles, which correspond to different times of the day, e.g., when the unit price of energy is higher.</description>

      <title>Coupled acoustoplasmonic resonators: the role of geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustoplasmonic resonators, such as nanobars and crosses, are efficient acousto-optical transducers. The excitation of mechanical modes in these structures strongly depends on the spatial profile of the eigenmodes of the resonator. Using a system of two identical gold elongated bars placed on a silicon dioxide substrate, we examine how breaking mirror symmetries affects the optical and acoustic properties to provide insights in the design of acoustoplasmonic metasurfaces for nonsymmetric acousto-optical transducers. Our findings show that, the absence of mirror symmetries affects differently the optical and nanomechanical response. Broken mirror symmetries not only couple nanomechanical modes existing in single bars, but introduces new torsional resonant modes.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic nonreciprocal devices based on susceptibility-programmable medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The switching and control of optical fields based on nonlinear optical effects are often limited to relatively weak nonlinear susceptibility and strong optical pump fields. Here, an optical medium with programmable susceptibility tensor based on polarizable atoms is proposed. Under a structured optical pump, the ground state population of atoms could be efficiently controlled by tuning the chirality and intensity of optical fields, and thus the optical response of the medium is programmable in both space and time. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by engineering the spatial distribution of the complex susceptibility tensor of the medium in photonic structures to realize nonreciprocal optical effects. Specifically, we investigate the advantages of chiral interaction between atoms and photons in an atom-cladded waveguide, theoretically showing that reconfigurable, strong, and fastly switchable isolation of optical signals in a selected optical mode is possible. The susceptibility-programmable medium provides a promising way to efficiently control the optical field, opening up a wide range of applications for integrated photonic devices and structured optics.</description>

      <title>Microwave Photonic Multi-Mode Injection-Locked Frequency Divider With a Wide Operational Range Based on an Optoelectronic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a microwave photonic multi-mode injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) with a wide frequency operational range based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). In the OEO, a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a photodetector (PD) are employed to construct a frequency multiplier to achieve an N-1 times frequency multiplication, which is then mixed with an external injection signal at an electrical mixer in the OEO loop. By adjusting the round-trip gain and time delay of the OEO loop, a radio frequency (RF) signal with a frequency that is 1/N that of the injection signal is generated, thus N times frequency division is achieved. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ILFD. The results demonstrate that the system can divide a RF signal from 2.6 to 20.8 GHz to 1.3 to 1.95 GHz with different frequency division factors ranging from 2 to 13. A significant improvement in phase noise of 35.11 dB is also obtained at a frequency offset of 100 kHz when the frequency division factor is 13.</description>

      <title>Single-photon super-resolved spectroscopy from spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate spectroscopy of incoherent light with sub-diffraction resolution. In a proof-of-principle experiment we analyze the spectrum of a pair of incoherent point-like sources whose separation is below the diffraction limit. The two sources mimic a planetary system, with a brighter source for the star and a dimmer one for the planet. Acquiring spectral information about the secondary source is hard because the two images have a substantial overlap. This limitation is solved by leveraging a structured measurement based on spatial-mode demultiplexing, where light is first sorted in its Hermite-Gaussian components in the transverse field, then measured by photon detection. This allows us to effectively decouple the photons coming from the two sources. An application is suggested to enhance exoplanets' atmosphere spectroscopy. A number of experiments of super-resolution imaging based on spatial demultiplexing have been conducted in the past few years, with promising results. Here, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we extend this concept to the domain of spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structures of several metamaterials are described by generalized eigenvalue equations where complex bands emerge even if the involved matrices are Hermitian. In this paper, we provide a geometrical understanding of the real-complex transition of the band structures. Specifically, our analysis, based on auxiliary eigenvalues, elucidates the correspondence between the real-complex transition of the generalized eigenvalue equations and Lifshitz transition in electron systems. Furthermore, we elucidate that real (complex) bands of a photonic system correspond to the Fermi surfaces of type-II (type-I) Dirac cones in electron systems when the permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the permeability $\mu$ are independent of frequency. In addition, our analysis elucidates that EPs are induced by the frequency dependence of the permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the permeability $\mu$ in our photonic system.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Photo-Physical Properties of Plexcitons in Strongly Coupled Metal-Organic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton plasmon polaritons have gained increasing interests over recent years due to their versatile properties emerging by the underlying light-matter coupling and making them potential candidates for new photonic applications. We have advanced this concept by studying thin films of laterally aligned J-type aggregates of self-assembled tetra-bay phenoxy-dendronized perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules, arranged in a helical manner of three strains on a silver surface. As a result of the interaction between the uniformly aligned dipole moments and the surface plasmons of a thin silver layer underneath, the excitonic state at 1.94 eV evolves into dispersions in absorption and emission, both characterized by a distinct anisotropy. The coupling constant defined by the scalar product of the transition dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ and the surface plasmon wavevector $\vec{k}_x$ shows a pronounced two-fold rotational symmetry with values between almost 0 to 28 meV. Complementary TD-DFT calculations of the angular dependent absorption and photoluminescence provide insights in the coherent energy exchange between the excitonic and plasmonic sub-systems. Additionally, power dependent PL studies yield first evidence that the diffusion length of the coupled exciton-plasmon polaritons exceeds that of the mere Frenkel state in neat PBI by at least one order of magnitude. Our results not only demonstrate the possibility to control the photo-physical properties of strongly coupled states by their spatially anisotropic light-matter interaction but also reveal innovative strategies to influence opto-electronic device operation by the directional transport of hybrid state energy.</description>

      <title>Computer-generated holography enables high-uniformity, high-efficiency depth-of-focus extension in endoscopic OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-form optics extends the high-resolution tomographic imaging capabilities of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to the inside of the human body, i.e., endoscopic OCT. However, it still faces challenges due to the trade-off between probe size, resolution, and Depth Of Focus (DOF). Here we introduce a method for extending the DOF in endoscopic OCT with high uniformity and efficiency. On the basis of multi-level diffractive optics, we leverage the multi-dimensional light field modulation capabilities of Computer-Generated Holography (CGH), to achieve precise control of the intensity distribution of the off-axis portion of the OCT probe light. Our method eliminates the need for an objective lens, allowing for direct fabrication at the distal facet of a single-mode fiber using femtosecond laser two-photon 3D printing. The superiority of our method has been verified through numerical simulation, beam measurement, and imaging results obtained with our home-built endoscopic OCT system.</description>

      <title>Fast and light-efficient wavefront shaping with a MEMS phase-only light modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, spatial light modulators (SLMs) have revolutionised our ability to shape optical fields. They grant independent dynamic control over thousands of degrees-of-freedom within a single light beam. In this work we test a new type of SLM, known as a phase-only light modulator (PLM), that blends the high efficiency of liquid crystal SLMs with the fast switching rates of binary digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs). A PLM has a 2D mega-pixel array of micro-mirrors. The vertical height of each micro-mirror can be independently adjusted with 4-bit precision. Here we provide a concise tutorial on the operation and calibration of a PLM. We demonstrate arbitrary pattern projection, aberration correction, and control of light transport through complex media. We show high-speed wavefront shaping through a multimode optical fibre -- scanning over 2000 points at 1.44 kHz. We make available our custom high-speed PLM control software library developed in C++. As PLMs are based upon micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology, they are polarisation agnostic, and possess fundamental switching rate limitations equivalent to that of DMDs -- with operation at up to 10 kHz anticipated in the near future. We expect PLMs will find high-speed light shaping applications across a range of fields including adaptive optics, microscopy, optogenetics and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Non-Conventional Thermal States of Interacting Bosonic Oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has recently been a growing effort to understand in a comprehensive manner the physics and intricate dynamics of many-body and many-state (multimode) interacting bosonic systems. For instance, in photonics, nonlinear multimode fibers are nowadays intensely investigated due to their promise for ultra-high-bandwidth and high-power capabilities. Similar prospects are pursued in connection with magnon Bose-Einstein condensates, and ultra-cold atoms in periodic lattices for room-temperature quantum devices and quantum computation respectively. While it is practically impossible to monitor the phase space of such complex systems (classically or quantum mechanically), thermodynamics, has succeeded to predict their thermal state: the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) distribution for classical fields and the Bose-Einstein (BE) distribution for quantum systems. These distributions are monotonic and promote either the ground state or the most excited mode. Here, we demonstrate the possibility to advance the participation of other modes in the thermal state of bosonic oligomers. The resulting non-monotonic modal occupancies are described by a microcanonical treatment while they deviate drastically from the RJ/BE predictions of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. Our results provide a paradigm of ensemble equivalence violation and can be used for designing the shape of thermal states.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Whispering Gallery Mode Microlasers for Precision Controlled Cellular Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode microlasers are known for their high Q-factors, characteristic emission spectra and sensitivity to local refractive index changes. This sensitivity combined with the ability of various cell types to internalise these microlasers provide unique opportunities for advanced biological studies, e.g. in single-cell tracking and intracellular sensing. Despite many advancements, achieving precise delivery of lasers to cells remains challenging, with traditional methods, such as microinjection, often also resulting in cellular damage. Here, we show that optical trapping is a promising solution for microlaser manipulation and therefore for their controlled and non-invasive delivery to target cells. By integrating optical trapping with microlaser-based refractive index sensing, we study the dynamics of microlaser-uptake by cells. We also find that in some cases the peaks in the emission spectra of our microlasers broaden, split, and shift, and we assign this to local inhomogeneities in refractive index surrounding the microlaser. This shows how optical trapping can further expand the unique toolkit offered by biointegrated whispering gallery mode microlasers.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Fano coupling in an opto-thermoelectric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonances in photonics arise from the coupling and interference between two resonant modes in structures with broken symmetry. They feature an uneven and narrow and tunable lineshape, and are ideally suited for optical spectroscopy. Many Fano resonance structures have been suggested in nanophotonics over the last ten years, but reconfigurability and tailored design remain challenging. Herein, we propose an all-optical pick-and-place approach aimed at assemble Fano metamolecules of various geometries and compositions in a reconfigurable manner. We study their coupling behavior by in-situ dark-field scattering spectroscopy. Driven by a light-directed opto-thermoelectric field, silicon nanoparticles with high quality-factor Mie resonances (discrete states) and low-loss BaTiO3 nanoparticles (continuum states) are assembled into all-dielectric heterodimers, where distinct Fano resonances are observed. The Fano parameter can be adjusted by changing the resonant frequency of the discrete states or the light polarization. We also show tunable coupling strength and multiple Fano resonances by altering the number of continuum states and discrete states in dielectric heterooligomers. Our work offers a general design rule for Fano resonance and an all-optical platform for controlling Fano coupling on demand.</description>

      <title>Directional sources realised by toroidal dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional optical sources can give rise to the directional excitation and propagation of light. The directionality of the conventional directional dipole (CDD) sources are attributed to the interference of the electric and/or magnetic dipoles, while the effect of the toroidal dipole on optical directionality remains unexplored.} Here, we numerically and analytically investigate the directional properties of the toroidal dipole. We show that the toroidal dipole can replace the electric dipole in the CDD sources to form the pseudo directional dipoles (PDDs), which can be applied to achieve analogous near-field directional coupling with a silicon waveguide. Moreover, the directionality of the PDDs can be flexibly controlled by changing the geometric parameters of the toroidal dipole, leading to tunable asymmetric coupling between the sources and the waveguide. These new types of directional sources provide more degrees of freedom for tailoring the optical directionality compared to the conventional sources. The results open new possibilities for directional light manipulation and can find applications in on-chip optical routing, waveguiding, and nanophotonic communications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of luminescence chirality through achiral metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized light (CPL) sources are essential for chiroptics, spintronics, quantum optics, and asymmetric photochemistry. However, conventional approaches fail to simultaneously realize a large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and wide-range tuning of glum in a compact device. Chiral luminophores usually suffer from low glum due to their small molecular sizes. Although chiral metasurfaces can enable a large glum, they lack post-fabrication tunability. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high-purity circularly polarized luminescence using achiral metasurfaces. These metasurfaces enable optical tuning and even reversal of luminescence chirality by uncovering and utilizing giant near-field chirality. We validate our concept with upconversion nanoparticles and downshifting dye molecules, experimentally achieving a large glum of up to 1.65, which can be actively and continuously tuned between 1.65 and -1.58. Our approach promises important applications in next-generation CPL sources and detectors, and tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Circularly-Symmetric Alternating Optical Vortex Lattices and their Focusing Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating controllable optical vortex (OV) lattices (OVLs) with arbitrary-order topological charge (TC) and superior optical characteristics are highly desirable for various applications. Here, we report an experimental realization of circularly-symmetric OVLs with alternating positive and negative TCs of order +/-n, referred to the $n$th-order circularly-symmetric alternating OVL (CSAOVL). The focusing fields of such CSAOVLs exhibit the very interesting patterns with a period of 4 for different n values, and their intensity and phase distributions can be regulated using the radial and azimuthal parameters. Particularly, the formed central bright spot in the focusing fields of those CSAOVLs with n equaling to a multiple of 4 is observed to be much smaller than a Gaussian spot. The results can promote significantly the exploration of structured OVLs and provide potential applications in particle manipulation, imaging, and the realization of complex interactions between optical lattices and microscope particles such as atoms and micro- or nano-particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive phase noise characterization of a mid-IR Cr:ZnS frequency comb. Despite their emergence as a platform for high-resolution dual-comb spectroscopy, detailed investigations into the phase noise of Cr:ZnS combs have been lacking. To address this, we use a recently proposed phase noise measurement technique that employs multi-heterodyne detection and subspace tracking. This allows for the measurement of the common mode, repetition-rate and high-order phase noise terms, and their corresponding scaling as a function of a comb-line number, using a single measurement set-up. We demonstrate that the comb under test is dominated by the common mode phase noise, while all the other phase noise terms are below the measurement noise floor (~ -120 dB rad^2/Hz), and are thereby not identifiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic sampling allows the electric field of THz, mid-infrared and visible light pulses to be measured directly as a function of time, with data analysis often performed in the frequency domain after fast Fourier transform. Here we introduce a version of the discrete Fourier transform that is consistent with the analytical continuous Fourier transform, enabling the quantitative study of the amplitude and phase of light pulses without the phase ambiguity inherent in the conventional definition of the discrete Fourier transform. We then show that a phenomenological time-domain model, based on carrier and envelope waves, that can reproduce the wide variety of narrow-band and broadband multi- to single-cycle THz pulses reported in the literature, such as from spintronic emitters, photoconductive antennae, optical rectification and free electron lasers. We discuss the influence of the pulse envelope's duration, the carrier-envelope phase and the pulse arrival time on the complex spectra. The methodology and results described provide a valuable toolkit that unlocks the full potential of the phase information available in time-domain spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The Non-reciprocity of Multi-mode Optical Directional Amplifier Realized by Non-Hermitian Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, a multi-frequency optical non-reciprocal transmission is first realized by using a non-Hermitian multi-mode resonator array.We find that the non-reciprocity can be used to route optical signals, to prevent the reverse flow of noise, and find that the multi-frequency can be used to enhance information processing. In terms of the Scully-Lamb model and gain saturation effect, we accomplish a dual-frequency non-reciprocal transmission by introducing nonlinearity into a linear array of four-mode resonators. For example, a directional cyclic amplifier is constructed with non-reciprocal units. As potential applications, the non-reciprocity optical systems can be employed in dual-frequency control, parallel information processing, photonic integrated circuits, optical devices and so on.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Tunable Photochemical Charge Transfer via Long-Lived Bloch Surface Wave Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of photoinduced molecular charge transfer reactions underpins key emerging technologies. As such, the use of hybrid light-matter molecular exciton-polariton states has been proposed as a scheme to directly modify the efficiency and rate of such reactions. However, the efficacy of polariton-driven photochemistry remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate conditions under which photoinduced polaritonic charge transfer can be achieved and directly visualized using momentum resolved ultrafast spectroscopy. Key conditions for charge transfer are satisfied using Bloch surface wave polaritons, which exhibit favorable dispersion characteristics that permit the selective pumping of hybrid states with long lifetimes (100-400 fs) that permit vibrationally assisted molecular charge transfer. Using this approach, we tune the energetic driving force for charge separation, reducing it by as much as 0.5 eV compared to the bare exciton. These results establish that tunable and efficient polariton-driven molecular charge transfer is indeed possible using carefully considered photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Noncentrosymmetric 2D Materials by Fourier Space Second Harmonic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controlled assembly of twisted 2D structures requires precise determination of the crystal orientation of their component layers. In the established procedure, the second-harmonic generation (SHG) intensity of a noncentrosymmetric layer is recorded while rotating the polarization of both the incident laser field and detected SHG, which can be time-consuming and tedious. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal orientation of transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride can be directly determined by recording SHG images generated by tightly focused laser beams in Fourier space. Using an azimuthally polarized laser beam, the SHG image distinctly reflects the hexagonal structure of the crystal lattice, revealing its orientation quickly and accurately. This technique could significantly impact the field of twistronics, which studies the effects of the relative angle between the layers of a stacked 2D structure, as well as advances the nanofabrication of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Maximum Shannon Capacity of Photonic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information transfer through electromagnetic waves is an important problem that touches a variety of technologically relevant applications, including computing and telecommunications. Prior attempts to establish limits on optical information transfer have treated waves propagating through known photonic structures (including vacuum). In this article, we address fundamental questions concerning optimal information transfer in photonic devices. Combining information theory, wave scattering, and optimization theory, we formulate bounds on the maximum Shannon capacity that may be achieved by structuring senders, receivers, and their environment. Allowing for arbitrary structuring leads to a non-convex problem that is significantly more difficult than its fixed structure counterpart, which is convex and satisfies a known "water-filling" solution. We derive a geometry-agnostic convex relaxation of the problem that elucidates fundamental physics and scaling behavior of Shannon capacity with respect to device parameters and the importance of structuring for enhancing capacity. We also show that in regimes where communication is dominated by power insertion requirements, maximum Shannon capacity maps to a biconvex optimization problem in the basis of singular vectors of the Green's function. This problem admits analytical solutions that give physically intuitive interpretations of channel and power allocation and reveals how Shannon capacity varies with signal-to-noise ratio. Proof of concept numerical examples show that bounds are within an order of magnitude of achievable device performance and successfully predict the scaling of performance with channel noise. The presented methodologies have implications for the optimization of antennas, integrated photonic devices, metasurface kernels, MIMO space-division multiplexers, and waveguides to maximize communication efficiency and bit-rates.</description>

      <title>Full-field Brillouin microscopy based on an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin microscopy is an emerging optical elastography technique that can be used to assess mechanical properties of biological samples in a 3D, all-optical and hence non-contact fashion. However, the low cross-section of spontaneous Brillouin scattering results in weak signals typically requiring prolonged exposure times or illumination dosages potentially harmful for biological samples. Here, we present a new approach for highly-multiplexed, and therefore rapid, spectral acquisition of the Brillouin scattered light. Specifically, by exploiting a custom-built Fourier-transform imaging spectrometer and the symmetric properties of the Brillouin spectrum, we experimentally demonstrate full-field 2D spectral Brillouin imaging of phantoms as well as biological samples, at a throughput of up to 40,000 spectra per second over a ~300um field-of-view. This represents an approximately three orders of magnitude improvement in speed and throughput compared to standard confocal methods while retaining high spatial resolution and the capability to acquire three-dimensional images of photosensitive samples in biology and medicine.</description>

      <title>Pupil-Adaptive 3D Holography Beyond Coherent Depth-of-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent holographic display approaches propelled by deep learning have shown remarkable success in enabling high-fidelity holographic projections. However, these displays have still not been able to demonstrate realistic focus cues, and a major gap still remains between the defocus effects possible with a coherent light-based holographic display and those exhibited by incoherent light in the real world. Moreover, existing methods have not considered the effects of the observer's eye pupil size variations on the perceived quality of 3D projections, especially on the defocus blur due to varying depth-of-field of the eye.
  In this work, we propose a framework that bridges the gap between the coherent depth-of-field of holographic displays and what is seen in the real world due to incoherent light. To this end, we investigate the effect of varying shape and motion of the eye pupil on the quality of holographic projections, and devise a method that changes the depth-of-the-field of holographic projections dynamically in a pupil-adaptive manner. Specifically, we introduce a learning framework that adjusts the receptive fields on-the-go based on the current state of the observer's eye pupil to produce image effects that otherwise are not possible in current computer-generated holography approaches. We validate the proposed method both in simulations and on an experimental prototype holographic display, and demonstrate significant improvements in the depiction of depth-of-field effects, outperforming existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively by at least 5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>An Idea of Implementing Photonic Space-Time Crystals Using Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic space time crystals (PSTCs) are emerging materials characterized by periodic variations in electromagnetic parameters with respect to both space and time. To date, research on PSTCs remains theoretical, with no practical realization reported. This article presents the practical realization of PSTCs through the design and simulation of a 2D metasurface-based photonic space-time crystal. It illustrates the characteristics of energy bandgaps, momentum bandgaps, and mixed energy momentum bandgap eigenmodes within the dispersion relation of these crystals. Additionally, the article details the properties of second order exceptional points that occur when two bandgaps overlap under specific conditions. The application of the metasurface based PSTC in 6G wireless communications is also demonstrated. This work aims to advance the understanding of PSTCs and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Parallax in angular sensitive powder diffraction tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a few methods for the determination of depth-resolved strain distributions each with inherent limitations are available, tomographic reconstruction has been applied to this problem in only a limited sense. One of the challenges was the potential impact of geometric parallax, which constitutes a non-negligible lateral offset of diffraction information arising from different sample depths at the detector. Here, the effect of parallax was investigated and two main results have emerged. First, the impact of parallax was found to be additive to other offset contributions, which implies a straightforward correction. Second, for tomographic scans utilizing a full 360{\deg} rotation parallax has been found to have no impact on reconstructions of angular information.</description>

      <title>FOS: A fully integrated open-source program for Fast Optical Spectrum calculations of nanoparticle media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FOS, which means light in Greek, is an open-source program for Fast Optical Spectrum calculations of nanoparticle media. This program takes the material properties and a description of the system as input, and outputs the spectral response including the reflectance, absorptance, and transmittance. Previous open-source codes often include only one portion of what is needed to calculate the spectral response of a nanoparticulate medium, such as Mie theory or a Monte Carlo method. FOS is designed to provide a convenient fully integrated format to remove the barrier as well as providing a significantly accelerated implementation with compiled Python code, parallel processing, and pre-trained machine learning predictions. This program can accelerate optimization and high throughput design of optical properties of nanoparticle or nanocomposite media, such as radiative cooling paint and solar heating liquids, allowing for the discovery of new materials and designs. FOS also enables convenient modeling of lunar dust coatings, combustion particulates, and many other particulate systems. In this paper we discuss the methodology used in FOS, features of the program, and provide four case studies.</description>

      <title>Annular x-ray optics offer superior resolution for radiation sensitive samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution x-ray microscopy requires a high photon flux to measure the signal from weakly scattering samples. This exposes samples to high radiation doses, potentially damaging or destroying them through radiation damage. In this work, we propose the use of annular optics in scanning microscopy as an alternative to full-aperture optics. Annular optics act as high-pass filters. Compared to regular optics with the same numerical aperture, annular optics expose the sample to less dose while producing the same signal from small sample features. Annular optics benefit significantly from the high photon fluxes of the latest x-ray sources to compensate for their overall smaller cross section. Using numerical simulations, we show that annular optics offer superior optical performance for sample features close to the resolution limit of the optic.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel frequency router based on valley-Hall metacrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics has revolutionized manipulations of electromagnetic waves by leveraging various topological phases proposed originally in condensed matters, leading to robust and error-immune signal processing. Despite considerable efforts, a critical challenge remains in devising frequency routers operating at a broadband frequency range with limited crosstalk. Previous designs usually relied on fine tuning of parameters and are difficult to be integrated efficiently and compactly. Here, targeting the demand for frequency-selective applications in on-chip photonics, we explore a topological approach to photonic frequency router via valley-Hall metacrystals. Diverging from the majority of studies which focuses on zigzag interfaces, our research shifts the attention to armchair interfaces within an ABA sandwich-like structure, where a single column of type-B metacrystal acts as a perturbation in the background type-A metacrystal. Essentially, through tuning a single geometric parameter of the type-B metacrystal, this configuration gives rise to interface states within a customized frequency band, enabling signal routing with limited crosstalk to meet specified demands. Moreover, this concept is practically demonstrated through a photonic frequency router with three distinct channels, experimentally exhibiting robust wave transmissions with excellent agreement with the design. This investigation manifests possible applications of the armchair interfaces in valley-Hall photonic systems and advances development of photonic devices that are both compact and efficient. Notably, the approach is naturally compatible with on-chip photonics and integration, which could benefit telecommunications and optical computing applications.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>K-band LiNbO3 A3 Lamb-wave Resonators with Sub-wavelength Through-holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing critical challenges in Lamb wave resonators, this paper presents the first validation of resonators incorporating sub-wavelength through-holes. Using the A3 mode resonator based on a LiNbO3 single-crystal thin film and operating in the K band as a prominent example, we demonstrate the advantages of the through-hole design. In the absence of additional processing steps, and while maintaining device performance--including operating frequency, electromechanical coupling coefficient, and quality factor--without introducing extra spurious modes, this approach effectively reduces the ineffective suspension area of the piezoelectric LN film, potentially enhancing mechanical and thermal stability. It also standardizes etching distances (and times) across various Lamb wave resonators on a single wafer, facilitating the development of Lamb wave filters. The versatility of the through-hole technique, with relaxed constraints on hole geometry and arrangement, further highlights its significance. Together with the other advantages, these features underscore the transformative potential of through-holes in advancing the practical implementation of Lamb wave resonators and filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport is a fundamental mechanism of energy transfer process quite distinct from wave propagation phenomena. It can be manipulated well beyond the possibilities offered by natural materials with a new generation of artificial metamaterials: thermal metamaterials. Topological physics, a focal point in contemporary condensed matter physics, is closely intertwined with thermal metamaterials in recent years. Inspired by topological photonics and topological acoustics in wave metamaterials, a new research field emerged recently, which we dub `topological thermotics', which encompasses three primary branches: topological thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. For topological thermal conduction, we discuss recent advances in both 1D and higher-dimensional thermal topological phases. For topological thermal convection, we discuss the implementation of thermal exceptional points with their unique properties and non-Hermitian thermal topological states. Finally, we review the most recent demonstration of topological effects in the near-field and far-field radiation. Anticipating future developments, we conclude by discussing potential directions of topological thermotics, including the expansion into other diffusion processes such as particle dynamics and plasma physics, and the integration with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Suppression of soliton collapses, modulational instability, and rogue-wave excitation in two-L\'evy-index fractional Kerr media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: s in laser systems with two fractional-dispersion/diffraction terms, quantified by their L\'{e}vy indices, $\alpha_{1}\, \alpha_{2}\in (1, 2]$, and self-focusing or defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only one L\'{e}vy index $\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\'{e}vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\'{e}vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. We show that the mathematical assumptions underlying the proof of the CHSH inequality are, in fact, incompatible with the physics of the experiments testing such inequality. This implies that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data yet. However, we also show that an experimental proof of CHSH inequality is, in principle, possible, but it is unclear how to implement, in practice, such an experiment.</description>

      <title>Chisel-edged screens to reduce loss in highly overmoded THz iris lines with finite screen thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we report observations on the growth trends of diffraction power loss and ohmic power loss, as functions of screen thickness, in highly overmoded THz iris-line waveguides that are constructed from thin screens. Recent theoretical developments have given a detailed field description, including eigen and transient analyses, that characterizes such waveguides under paraxial dipole-mode excitation. Informed by these analyses, we can better estimate -- and minimize -- power loss effects due to finite screen thickness in practical realizations. A geometric variation is proposed whereby we limit the growth trend in ohmic loss, even when using relatively thicker screens in practice.</description>

      <title>A Low-Temperature Tunable Microcavity featuring High Passive Stability and Microwave Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum nanophotonics has forged a rich nexus of nanotechnology with photonic quantum information processing, offering remarkable prospects for advancing quantum technologies beyond their current technical limits in terms of physical compactness, energy efficiency, operation speed, temperature robustness and scalability. In this perspective, we highlight a number of recent studies that reveal the especially compelling potential of nanoplasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics for driving quantum technologies down to nanoscale spatial and ultrafast temporal regimes, whilst elevating them to ambient temperatures. Our perspective encompasses innovative proposals for quantum plasmonic biosensing, driving ultrafast single-photon emission and achieving near-field multipartite entanglement in the strong coupling regime, with a notable emphasis on the use of industry-grade devices. We conclude with an outlook emphasizing how the bespoke characteristics and functionalities of plasmonic devices are shaping contemporary research directives in ultrafast and room-temperature quantum nanotechnologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale programmable photonic circuits are opening up new possibilities for information processing providing fast and energy-efficient means for matrix-vector multiplication. Here, we introduce a novel architecture of photonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices, usually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or quantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter meshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous designs, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology. We have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower depth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware errors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast modulation of guided-mode resonance in a nonlinear silicon nitride grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are subjects of both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the refractive index of a material under intense laser illumination. This effect is inherently weak, limiting its practical use in free-space nanophotonics. In this work, we demonstrate an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by more than three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating with an overall thickness of less than 300 nm. Our study involves the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses. We observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, leading to more than fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude and enabling transitions between `Off' and `On' states of transmission. We also demonstrate the capability of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The results presented here reveal promising directions for developing advanced all-optical devices based on free-space nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Position Detection of an Optically Levitated Mie Particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the problem of position detection of an optically levitated Mie particle. The information radiation field (IRF) is proposed and defined to characterize the scattered light carrying complete information about the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion of the particle. Based on the IRF, we suggest an optimal detection scheme for the position of arbitrary particles. We calculate both the information losses of objective collection and mode-matching in levitated optomechanical experiments. Our results conclude that the backward detection scheme, using an incident Gaussian beam focused by a high numerical aperture lens, provides sufficient information to achieve the quantum ground state through cooling of the three-dimensional c.m. motion of the Mie particle.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-regularized coded ptychography for robust and efficient lensless microscopy on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coded ptychography has emerged as a powerful technique for high-throughput, high-resolution lensless imaging. However, the trade-off between acquisition speed and image quality remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel sparsity-regularized approach to coded ptychography that dramatically reduces the number of required measurements while maintaining high reconstruction quality. The reported approach, termed the ptychographic proximal total-variation (PPTV) solver, formulates the reconstruction task as a total variation regularized optimization problem. Unlike previous implementations that rely on specialized hardware or illumination schemes, PPTV integrates seamlessly into existing coded ptychography setups. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that PPTV-driven coded ptychography can produce accurate reconstructions with as few as eight intensity measurements, a significant reduction compared to conventional methods. Convergence analysis confirms the robustness and stability of the PPTV algorithm. Experimental results from our optical prototype, featuring a disorder-engineered surface for wavefront modulation, validate PPTV's ability to achieve high-throughput, high-resolution imaging with a substantially reduced measurement burden. By enabling high-quality reconstructions from fewer measurements, PPTV paves the way for more compact, efficient, and cost-effective lensless microscopy systems on a chip, with potential applications in digital pathology, endoscopy, point-of-care diagnostics, and high-content screening.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation via single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a main bus. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces. Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial, and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W states, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing parameter $\xi_R^2\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL). Our finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into simply switching on/off microwave. It has direct applications in the variational quantum optimizer which is available with existing technology.</description>

      <title>Breaking surface plasmon excitation constraint via surface spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems have attracted great attention for their promising light-matter applications. However, the excitation of a surface plasmon, in particular, transverse-electric (TE) surface plasmon, remains an outstanding challenge due to the difficulty to conserve energy and momentum simultaneously in the normal 2D materials. Here we show that the TE surface plasmons ranging from gigahertz to terahertz regime can be effectively excited and manipulated in a hybrid dielectric, 2D material and magnet structure. The essential physics is that the surface spin wave supplements an additional freedom of surface plasmon excitation and thus greatly enhances the electric field in the 2D medium. Based on widely-used magnetic materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and manganese difluoride ($\mathrm{MnF}_2$), we further show that the plasmon excitation manifests itself as a measurable dip in the reflection spectrum of the hybrid system while the dip position and the dip depth can be well controlled by an electric gating on the 2D layer and an external magnetic field. Our findings should bridge the fields of low-dimensional physics, plasmonics and spintronics and open a novel route to integrate plasmonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ptychographic non-line-of-sight imaging for depth-resolved visualization of hidden objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables the visualization of objects hidden from direct view, with applications in surveillance, remote sensing, and light detection and ranging. Here, we introduce a NLOS imaging technique termed ptychographic NLOS (pNLOS), which leverages coded ptychography for depth-resolved imaging of obscured objects. Our approach involves scanning a laser spot on a wall to illuminate the hidden objects in an obscured region. The reflected wavefields from these objects then travel back to the wall, get modulated by the wall's complex-valued profile, and the resulting diffraction patterns are captured by a camera. By modulating the object wavefields, the wall surface serves the role of the coded layer as in coded ptychography. As we scan the laser spot to different positions, the reflected object wavefields on the wall translate accordingly, with the shifts varying for objects at different depths. This translational diversity enables the acquisition of a set of modulated diffraction patterns referred to as a ptychogram. By processing the ptychogram, we recover both the objects at different depths and the modulation profile of the wall surface. Experimental results demonstrate high-resolution, high-fidelity imaging of hidden objects, showcasing the potential of pNLOS for depth-aware vision beyond the direct line of sight.</description>

      <title>Low Duty Cycle Pulsed UV Technique for Spectroscopy of Aluminum Monochloride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to minimize UV-induced damage in experiments that employ second-harmonic generation cavities. The principle of our approach is to reduce the duty cycle of the UV light as much as possible to prolong the lifetime of the used optics. The low duty cycle is achieved by ramping the cavity into resonance for a short time during the experimental cycle when the light is used and tuning it to an off-resonant state otherwise. The necessary fast ramp and length-stabilization control of the cavity is implemented with the FPGA-based STEMlab platform. We demonstrate the utility of this method by measuring the isotope shift of the electronic transition ($X^1\Sigma \leftarrow A^1\Pi$) in AlCl at 261.5 nm in a pulsed molecular beam experiment.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect of Nonlinear Optical Responses in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays important roles in the research of fundamental physics and the applications of high-performance optoelectronic devices. The bulk nonlinear optical responses arise from the uniform light absorption in noncentrosymmetric crystals, and hence are usually considered to be the collective phenomena of all atoms. Here we show, in contrast to this common expectation, the nonlinear optical responses in antiferromagnets can be selectively accumulated near the surfaces, representing a skin effect. This is because the inversion symmetry, despite being broken globally by magnetism, is barely violated locally deeply inside these antiferromagnets. Using A-type layered antiferromagnets as the representatives, we predict that the spatial-dependent nonlinear optical responses, such as bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are notable in the top- and bottom-most layers and decay rapidly when moving away from the surfaces. Such a phenomenon is strongly associated with the antiferromagnetism and exists in a broad range of antiferromagnets composed of centrosymmetric sublattices, offering promising device applications using these antiferromagnets. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked property of nonlinear optical responses and opens new opportunities for high-performance antiferromagnetic optospintronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnonics with Localized Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used. Here, we present a microwave spiral resonator supporting the spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor. The strong coupling and large engineering space render the spoof LSPs an interesting contender in developing novel hybrid magnonic systems and functionalities.</description>
