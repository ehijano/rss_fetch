      <title>When Every Symbol Counts: Resilient Wireless Systems Under Finite Blocklength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and enable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic environments and disruptions. Because these vital services require uninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is essential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery procedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short packets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication efficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can backfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under longer blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints within a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the wireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused by FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results reveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery from the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the system to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption, yielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we show that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster reconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the trade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint RIS-UE Association and Beamforming Design in RIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free (CF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks can significantly enhance system performance. However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes considerable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and antennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE) association into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly reduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are associated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels from non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE association and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the first stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE association. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based method that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP beamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we employ the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a semi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block diagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that, while RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor performance loss that remains within an acceptable range. Additionally, we investigate the impact of RIS deployment and conclude that RISs exhibit enhanced performance when positioned between APs and UEs.</description>

      <title>Searching Efficient Deep Architectures for Radar Target Detection using Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline is proposed.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Interoperable Channel State Feedback Compression with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML) in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multipath-Based SLAM for Distributed MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing users and mapping the environment using radio signals is a key task in emerging applications such as reliable communications, location-aware security, and safety critical navigation. Recently introduced multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) can jointly localize a mobile agent and the reflective surfaces in radio frequency (RF) environments. Most existing MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF propagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent dependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different propagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base station. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation paths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments with nonconvex geometries. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MP-SLAM method for distributed MIMO systems that addresses this limitation. In particular, we use amplitude statistics to establish adaptive time-varying detection probabilities. Based on the resulting "soft" ray-tracing strategy, our method can fuse information across propagation paths in RF environments with nonconvex geometries. A Bayesian estimation method for the joint estimation of map features and agent position is established by applying the message passing rules of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the factor graph that represents the proposed statistical model. We also introduce an improved proposal PDF for particle-based computation of SPA messages. This proposal PDF enables the early detection of new surfaces that are solely supported by double-bounce paths. Our method is validated using synthetic RF measurements in a challenging scenario with nonconvex geometries. The results demonstrate that it can provide accurate localization and mapping estimates as well as attain the posterior CRLB.</description>

      <title>From Token to Rhythm: A Multi-Scale Approach for ECG-Language Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token, beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.</description>

      <title>Improving Convergence for Semi-Federated Learning: An Energy-Efficient Approach by Manipulating Over-the-Air Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines federated and split learning, termed semi-federated learning (SemiFL), in which over-the-air computation is utilized for gradient aggregation. A key idea is to strategically adjust the learning rate by manipulating over-the-air distortion for improving SemiFL's convergence. Specifically, we intentionally amplify amplitude distortion to increase the learning rate in the non-stable region, thereby accelerating convergence and reducing communication energy consumption. In the stable region, we suppress noise perturbation to maintain a small learning rate for improving SemiFL's final convergence. Theoretical results demonstrate the antagonistic effects of over-the-air distortion in different regions, under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and non-i.i.d. data settings. Then, we formulate two energy consumption minimization problems, one for each region, which implements a two-region mean square error threshold configuration scheme. Accordingly, we propose two resource allocation algorithms with closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that under different network and data distribution conditions, strategically manipulating over-the-air distortion can efficiently adjust the learning rate to improve SemiFL's convergence. Moreover, energy consumption can be reduced by using the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas-aided Wireless Energy Transfer for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in movable antennas (MAs) technology create new opportunities for 6G and beyond wireless systems. MAs are promising for radio frequency wireless energy transfer because they can dynamically adjust antenna positions, improving energy efficiency and scalability. This work aims to minimize the power consumed by an analog beamforming power beacon equipped with independently-controlled MAs (IMAs) for charging multiple single-antenna devices. To this end, we enforce a minimum separation among antennas and a minimum received power at the devices. The resulting optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex due to interdependencies among the variables. To tackle this, we propose a semidefinite program guided particle swarm optimization (SgPSO) algorithm where each particle represents an antenna configuration, and the fitness function optimizes the corresponding power allocation. SgPSO is utilized for configuring the MAs largely outperforming fixed array implementations, particularly with more antennas or devices. We also present an alternative implementation using uniformly-spaced MAs, whose performance closely approaches that of the IMAs, with the gap widening only as the number of devices grows. We also examine how increasing the number of antennas promotes near-field conditions, which decrease as devices become more widely distributed.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Hybrid Neural Receiver for 6G-V2X Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural receiver models are proposed to jointly optimize multiple functionalities of wireless receivers; however, a comprehensive receiver model that replaces the entire physical layer blocks has not yet been presented in the literature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid neural receiver (H-NR) built on Transformer encoder blocks and Graph Neural Network (GNN), as part of an end-to-end wireless communication framework. In our communication framework, we assume vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario where information is transmitted by vehicle and received at the base station (BS). Our proposed H-NR model replace OFDM resource grid demapping, channel estimation, signal equalization, demodulation, and channel decoding. To test the adaptability of our proposed model on unseen conditions, we evaluate its performance for various scenarios, including a vehicle speed of range [0-60] km/h, a carrier frequency of 5.9GHz, and a cluster delay line (CDL) channel model. Furthermore, we assess the performance of our proposed H-NR on multimodal data, such as images, audio, GPS, radar, and LiDAR, to examine its adaptability in real-world use cases. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art neural receiver by approximately 0.5 dB in terms of reconstruction and error correction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Constellation Modulation for Symbol-Level Precoding in RIS-Enhanced MU-MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of symbol-level precoding (SLP) in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhanced multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems faces two main challenges. First, the state-of-the-art joint reflecting and SLP optimization approach requires exhaustive enumeration of all possible transmit symbol combinations, resulting in scalability issues as the modulation order and number of users increase. Second, conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) exhibits strict constructive interference (CI) regions, limiting its effectiveness for CI exploitation in SLP. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, termed hybrid-constellation modulation (HCM), which has a structure of superposed QAM and ASK sub-constellations (SCs). HCM extends the CI regions compared to QAM. Additionally, a two-stage reflecting and SLP optimization method is developed to support HCM. The proposed methods are designed for practical RIS with discrete phase shifts and has good scalability. Simulation results show that HCM achieves up to 1.5 dB and 1 dB SER gains over QAM with modulation order 16 and 64, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Indoor RIS-Aided Physical-Layer Security: A Codebook-Generation Methodology and Measurement-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks aim to support innovative Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that demand faster and more secure data transmission. While higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers employ measures like encryption and secure protocols to address data security, Physical-Layer Security (PLS) focuses on preventing information leakage to EavesDroppers (EDs) and mitigating the effects of jammers and spoofing attacks. In this context, the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can play an instrumental role, enhancing PLS by intelligently reflecting electromagnetic waves to benefit Legitimate Users (LUs) while obstructing EDs. This paper presents practical indoor measurements to evaluate the capability of an RIS to enhance PLS, focusing on a varactor-based RIS technology designed for the FR1 band at 3.55 GHz. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art RIS-aided secrecy optimization algorithms together with a novel approach designed in this paper, which relies on a newly generated RIS phase configuration codebook, highlight the potential of RISs to improve both data rates for LUs as well as secrecy against EDs in real-world indoor multipath environments. The results also demonstrate the frequency selectivity of the RIS, proviging practical insights on the optimization of the technology.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Distributed Phase Synchronization for Coherent Signal Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the feasibility of distributed phase synchronization for coherent signal superposition, a fundamental enabler for paradigms such as coherent over-the-air computation (OAC), distributed beamforming, and interference alignment, under mobility and hardware impairments. With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots (PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice.</description>

      <title>A Self-scaled Approximate $\ell_0$ Regularization Robust Model for Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust regression models in the presence of outliers have significant practical relevance in areas such as signal processing, financial econometrics, and energy management. Many existing robust regression methods, either grounded in statistical theory or sparse signal recovery, typically rely on the explicit or implicit assumption of outlier sparsity to filter anomalies and recover the underlying signal or data. However, these methods often suffer from limited robustness or high computational complexity, rendering them inefficient for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel robust regression model based on a Self-scaled Approximate l0 Regularization Model (SARM) scheme. By introducing a self-scaling mechanism into the regularization term, the proposed model mitigates the negative impact of uneven or excessively large outlier magnitudes on robustness. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm grounded in Proximal Operators and Block Coordinate Descent. We rigorously prove the algorithm convergence. Empirical comparisons with several state-of-the-art robust regression methods demonstrate that SARM not only achieves superior robustness but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Motivated by both the theoretical error bound and empirical observations, we further design a Two-Stage SARM (TSSARM) framework, which better utilizes sample information when the singular values of the design matrix are widely spread, thereby enhancing robustness under certain conditions. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world load forecasting task. The experimental results show that our method substantially enhances the robustness of load forecasting against adversarial data attacks, which is increasingly critical in the era of heightened data security concerns.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic filters are preferred front-end solutions at sub-6 GHz due to their superior frequency selectivity compared to electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. With the ongoing development of 5G and the evolution toward 6G, there is a growing need to extend acoustic filter technologies into frequency range 3 (FR3), which spans 7 to 24 GHz to accommodate emerging high-frequency bands. However, scaling acoustic filters beyond 10 GHz presents significant challenges, as conventional platforms suffer from increased insertion loss (IL) and degraded out-of-band (OoB) rejection at higher frequencies. Recent innovations have led to the emergence of periodically poled piezoelectric lithium niobate (P3F LN) laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs), offering low-loss and high electromechanical coupling performance above 10 GHz. This work presents the first tri-layer P3F LN filter operating at 19.3 GHz, achieving a low IL of 2.2 dB, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 8.5%, and an impressive 49 dB close in rejection. These results demonstrate strong potential for integration into FR3 diplexers.</description>

      <title>Fetal Sleep: A Cross-Species Review of Physiology, Measurement, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans. Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined, including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in prenatal care.</description>

      <title>UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods.

      <title>Multi-IRS Aided ISAC System: Multi-Path Exploitation Versus Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple IRSs are strategically deployed not only to assist the communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to a multi-antenna communication user (CU), but also enable the sensing service for a point target in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region of the BS. First, we propose a hybrid multi-IRS architecture, which consists of several passive IRSs and one semi-passive IRS equipped with both active sensors and reflecting elements. To be specific, the active sensors are exploited to receive the echo signals for estimating the target's angle information, and the multiple reflecting paths provided by multi-IRS are employed to improve the degree of freedoms (DoFs) of communication. Under the given budget on the number of total IRSs elements, we theoretically show that increasing the number of deployed IRSs is beneficial for improving DoFs of spatial multiplexing for communication while increasing the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of target estimation, which unveils a fundamental tradeoff between the sensing and communication performance. To characterize the rate-CRB tradeoff, we study a rate maximization problem, by optimizing the BS transmit covariance matrix, IRSs phase-shifts, and the number of deployed IRSs, subject to a maximum CRB constraint. Analytical results reveal that the communication-oriented design becomes optimal when the total number of IRSs elements exceeds a certain threshold, wherein the relationships of the rate and CRB with the number of IRS elements/sensors, transmit power, and the number of deployed IRSs are theoretically derived and demystified. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the superiority of our proposed designs over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Massive MIMO: A Cost-Efficient Technique for Uniform Service in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) has evolved along two tracks: cellular and cell-free, each with unique advantages and limitations. The cellular approach suffers from worse user spectral efficiency at cell edges, whereas the cell-free approach incurs high implementation costs due to a large-scale distributed infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel networking paradigm, termed heterogeneous massive MIMO (HmMIMO), which seamlessly integrates co-located and distributed antennas. Differing from two conventional paradigms, HmMIMO remains a base station with a large antenna array at the center of each cell, aided by distributed antennas deployed at cell edges. Our findings demonstrate that this paradigm achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and implementation complexity.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Redundancy Mitigation in Vulnerable Road User Awareness Messages for Bicycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V2X communication has become crucial for enhancing road safety, especially for Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) such as pedestrians and cyclists. However, the increasing number of devices communicating on the same channels will lead to significant channel load. To address this issue this study evaluates the effectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM), focusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the transmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a urban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover, Germany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by Channel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in simulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we analyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego VRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that while RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR. The analysis of actual differences revealed that the RM mechanism standardized by ETSI often uses outdated information, leading to significant discrepancies in position, speed, and heading, which could result in dangerous situations. To address these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the balance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness. The adapted approach shows a significant reduction in maximum CBR and a less significant decrease in VPR compared to the standardized RM. Moreover, it demonstrates better performance in the actual differences in position, speed, and heading, thereby enhancing overall safety. Our results highlight the need for further research to optimize RM techniques and ensure they effectively enhance V2X communication without compromising the safety of VRUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter analyzes the effects of power amplifiers (PAs) on the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO systems. We model signal transmission incorporating nonlinear PA distortion and derive a unified spectral efficiency (SE) expression applicable to arbitrary precoding schemes. To combat PA-induced performance degradation, a joint optimization approach for user association and max-min power control is proposed. Furthermore, a low-complexity alternative is developed to approximate the joint optimization with reduced computational overhead. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approaches over conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>In situ fine-tuning of in silico trained Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) promise significant advantages over traditional electronic neural networks, including ultrafast computation, high bandwidth, and low energy consumption, by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of photonics. However, training ONNs poses unique challenges, notably the reliance on simplified in silico models whose trained parameters must subsequently be mapped to physical hardware. This process often introduces inaccuracies due to discrepancies between the idealized digital model and the physical ONN implementation, particularly stemming from noise and fabrication imperfections.
  In this paper, we analyze how noise misspecification during in silico training impacts ONN performance and we introduce Gradient-Informed Fine-Tuning (GIFT), a lightweight algorithm designed to mitigate this performance degradation. GIFT uses gradient information derived from the noise structure of the ONN to adapt pretrained parameters directly in situ, without requiring expensive retraining or complex experimental setups. GIFT comes with formal conditions under which it improves ONN performance.
  We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GIFT via simulation on a five-layer feed forward ONN trained on the MNIST digit classification task. GIFT achieves up to $28\%$ relative accuracy improvement compared to the baseline performance under noise misspecification, without resorting to costly retraining. Overall, GIFT provides a practical solution for bridging the gap between simplified digital models and real-world ONN implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage, which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types, tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning, and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for efficient and scalable learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of Cyber-Physical System (CPS), accurately identifying attacks without detailed knowledge of the system's parameters remains a major challenge. When it comes to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), identifying the parameters of vehicle dynamics could be impractical or prohibitively costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for attack detection in vehicles that effectively addresses the uncertainty in their dynamics. Our method integrates the widely used Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), a well-known technique for nonlinear state estimation in dynamic systems, with machine learning algorithms. This combination eliminates the requirement for precise vehicle modeling in the detection process, enhancing the system's adaptability and accuracy. To validate the efficacy and practicality of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive comparative simulations by introducing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the vehicle systems' sensors and actuators.</description>

      <title>Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless-Powered NOMA: Continuous and Discrete Positioning Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a movable antenna (MA)-enabled wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where multiple wireless devices (WDs) first harvest energy from the downlink (DL) signal broadcast by a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit information in the uplink (UL) using non-orthogonal multiple access. Unlike conventional WPCNs with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), this MA-enabled WPCN allows the MAs at the HAP and the WDs to adjust their positions twice: once before DL wireless power transfer and once before DL wireless information transmission. Our goal is to maximize the system sum throughput by jointly optimizing the MA positions, the time allocation, and the UL power allocation. Considering the characteristics of antenna movement, we explore both continuous and discrete positioning designs, which, after formulation, are found to be non-convex optimization problems. Before tackling these problems, we rigorously prove that using identical MA positions for both DL and UL is the optimal strategy in both scenarios, thereby greatly simplifying the problems and enabling easier practical implementation of the system. We then propose alternating optimization-based algorithms for the resulting simplified problems. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed continuous MA scheme can enhance the sum throughput by up to 395.71% compared to the benchmark with FPAs, even when additional compensation transmission time is provided to the latter; 2) a step size of one-quarter wavelength for the MA motion driver is generally sufficient for the proposed discrete MA scheme to achieve over 80% of the sum throughput performance of the continuous MA scheme; 3) when each moving region is large enough to include multiple optimal positions for the continuous MA scheme, the discrete MA scheme can achieve comparable sum throughput without requiring an excessively small step size.</description>

      <title>Near Field Localization via AI-Aided Subspace Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demands for high-throughput and energy-efficient wireless communications are driving the adoption of extremely large antennas operating at high-frequency bands. In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the radiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike conventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field localization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and range information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its extensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field localization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions, including non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number of snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided subspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to real-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep learning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix to improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded AI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce computational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training method to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with casting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classical and existing deep-learning-based localization techniques, providing robust near-field localization even under coherent sources, miscalibrations, and few snapshots.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the second-order characteristics of the radar return signal from a swarm of rotor drones. We consider the case of a swarm of identical drones, with each a number of rotors comprised of a number of rotor blades. By considering the orientation and speed of each rotor as stochastic variables, we derive expressions for the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD). The ACF and PSD are in the form of an infinite series with coefficients that drop to zero at a predictable limit. Thus in practical applications, the series may be truncated. As a special case, we show that for deterministic rotor speed, the ACF can be expressed in closed form. We further investigate how system parameters (Blade length, Rotor speed, number of blades, and number of drones) influence the derived expressions for the ACF and PSD.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Environment-Based Channel Knowledge Map Construction</title>

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) provides certain levels of channel state information (CSI) for an area of interest, serving as a critical enabler for environment-aware communications by reducing the overhead of frequent CSI acquisition. However, existing CKM construction schemes adopt over-simplified environment information, which significantly compromises their accuracy. To address this issue, this work proposes a joint model- and data-driven approach to construct CKM by leveraging point cloud environmental data along with a few samples of location-tagged channel information. First, we propose a novel point selector to identify subsets of point cloud that contain environmental information relevant to multipath channel gains, by constructing a set of co-focal ellipsoids based on different time of arrival (ToAs). Then, we trained a neural channel gain estimator to learn the mapping between each selected subset and its corresponding channel gain, using a real-world dataset we collected through field measurements, comprising environmental point clouds and corresponding channel data. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that: For CKM construction of power delay profile (PDP), the proposed method achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.95 dB, significantly lower than the 7.32 dB achieved by the conventional ray-tracing method; for CKM construction of received power values, i.e., radio map, it achieves an RMSE of 1.04 dB, surpassing the Kriging interpolation method with an RMSE of 1.68 dB.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Graph Error Control with Low Complexity in Causal Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, with the objective of maximizing the long-term reward by selecting an optimal sequence of interventions on nodes in an unknown causal graph. It is assumed that both the causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. First, based on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed. Numerical results suggest that this method has a much lower sample complexity relative to the prior art by learning sub-graphs. However, we note that a sample complexity analysis for the new algorithm has not been undertaken, as of yet. Under the assumption of minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound drives an upper confidence bound-based intervention selection to optimize the reward. Further, we consider a particular instance of non-stationary bandits wherein both the causal topology and interventional distributions can change. Our solution is the design of a sub-graph change detection mechanism that requires a modest number of samples. Numerical results compare the new methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement in stationary and non-stationary settings. Averaged over 100 randomly generated causal bandits, the proposed scheme takes significantly fewer samples to learn the causal structure and achieves a reward gain of 85% compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number demonstrating its ability to yield very consistent estimates.</description>

      <title>Learning Networks from Wide-Sense Stationary Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems driven by latent inputs are common in fields like neuroscience, finance, and engineering. A key inference problem here is to learn edge connectivity from node outputs (potentials). We focus on systems governed by steady-state linear conservation laws: $X_t = {L^{\ast}}Y_{t}$, where $X_t, Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denote inputs and potentials, respectively, and the sparsity pattern of the $p \times p$ Laplacian $L^{\ast}$ encodes the edge structure. Assuming $X_t$ to be a wide-sense stationary stochastic process with a known spectral density matrix, we learn the support of $L^{\ast}$ from temporally correlated samples of $Y_t$ via an $\ell_1$-regularized Whittle's maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The regularization is particularly useful for learning large-scale networks in the high-dimensional setting where the network size $p$ significantly exceeds the number of samples $n$.
  We show that the MLE problem is strictly convex, admitting a unique solution. Under a novel mutual incoherence condition and certain sufficient conditions on $(n, p, d)$, we show that the ML estimate recovers the sparsity pattern of $L^\ast$ with high probability, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph underlying $L^{\ast}$. We provide recovery guarantees for $L^\ast$ in element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with several simulation studies on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including engineered systems (power and water networks), and real-world datasets from neural systems (such as the human brain).</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .</description>

      <title>Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables continuous and unobtrusive assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue, stress, and user experience. Commonly used wearable PPG sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact Pulse Rate (PR) assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulator. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable Empatica E4 sensor. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on PR estimation and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and PR extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm. Significant differences between PRs in younger and older drivers are observed in both rPPG and reference data. The study also thoroughly discusses bias within Empatica E4. Overall, results support the feasibility of integrating camera-based PR monitoring into driving simulators for real-time subject's assessment.</description>

Abstract: Integrated communication and sensing, which can make full use of the limited spectrum resources to perform communication and sensing tasks simultaneously, is an up-and-coming technology in wireless communication networks. In this work, we investigate the secrecy performance of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted secure integrated communication, sensing, and computing system, where the UAV sends radar signals to locate and disrupt potential eavesdroppers while providing offload services to ground users (GUs). Considering the constraints of UAV maximum speed, transmit power, and propulsion energy, as well as secure offloading, data transmission, and computation time, the total energy consumption of GUs is minimized by jointly optimizing user offloading ratio, user scheduling strategy, transmit beamforming, and UAV trajectory. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem caused by tightly coupled dependent variables. In particular, the original optimization problem is decomposed into four sub-optimization problems, and the non-convex sub-problems are transformed into approximately convex forms via successive convex approximation. Then, all sub-problems are solved successively by using the block coordinate descent technique. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>
