      <title>Invariant measures on moduli spaces of twisted holomorphic 1-forms and strata of dilation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of twisted holomorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces, equivalently dilation surfaces with scaling, admits a stratification and GL(2,R)-action as in the case of moduli spaces of translation surfaces. We produce an analogue of Masur-Veech measure, i.e. an SL(2,R)-invariant Lebesgue class measure on strata or explicit covers thereof. This relies on a novel computation of cohomology with coefficients for the mapping class group. The computation produces a framed mapping class group invariant measure on representation varieties that naturally appear as the codomains of the periods maps that coordinatize strata.</description>

      <title>Cappell-Shaneson polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. Cappell and J. Shaneson constructed a pair of inequivalent embeddings of $(n-1)$-spheres in homotopy $(n+1)$-spheres for every square matrix of order $n$ with special properties (a Cappell-Shaneson matrix). A Cappell-Shaneson polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of a Cappell-Shaneson matrix. In this paper, we interpret part of the definition of Cappell-Shaneson polynomial as algebraic conditions on polynomials in terms of signed reciprocal polynomial and reduction modulo primes, and give complete lists of all Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degrees $4$ and $5$. We construct several infinite series of Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degree $6$.</description>

      <title>Linear representations of the mapping class group of dimension at most $3g-3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify representations of the mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ (with at most one puncture or boundary component) up to dimension $3g-3$. Any such representation is the direct sum of a representation in dimension $2g$ or $2g+1$ (given as the action on the (co)homology of the surface or its unit tangent bundle) with a trivial representation. As a corollary, any linear system on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ in this range is of algebro-geometric origin.</description>

      <title>Compressed data structures for Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by gluing handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying in the surface, which define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface of complexity measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates' vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compressed than triangulations of 3-manifolds, given exponential gains for some families. Even with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial time algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations, detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and first homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving better precision and faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some particular presentations of the inputs.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutive symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>
