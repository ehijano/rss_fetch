      <title>Investigating the Interplay of Parameterization and Optimizer in Gradient-Free Topology Optimization: A Cantilever Beam Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22241v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-free black-box optimization (BBO) is widely used in engineering design and provides a flexible framework for topology optimization (TO), enabling the discovery of high-performing structural designs without requiring gradient information from simulations. Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.
  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.
  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Performance Evaluation for Multi-Party Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiparty multiobjective optimization problems, solution sets are usually evaluated using classical performance metrics, aggregated across DMs. However, such mean-based evaluations may be unfair by favoring certain parties, as they assume identical geometric approximation quality to each party's PF carries comparable evaluative significance. Moreover, prevailing notions of MPMOP optimal solutions are restricted to strictly common Pareto optimal solutions, representing a narrow form of cooperation in multiparty decision making scenarios. These limitations obscure whether a solution set reflects balanced relative gains or meaningful consensus among heterogeneous DMs. To address these issues, this paper develops a fairness-aware performance evaluation framework grounded in a generalized notion of consensus solutions. From a cooperative game-theoretic perspective, we formalize four axioms that a fairness-aware evaluation function for MPMOPs should satisfy. By introducing a concession rate vector to quantify acceptable compromises by individual DMs, we generalize the classical definition of MPMOP optimal solutions and embed classical performance metrics into a Nash-product-based evaluation framework, which is theoretically shown to satisfy all axioms. To support empirical validation, we further construct benchmark problems that extend existing MPMOP suites by incorporating consensus-deficient negotiation structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation framework is able to distinguish algorithmic performance in a manner consistent with consensus-aware fairness considerations. Specifically, algorithms converging toward strictly common solutions are assigned higher evaluation scores when such solutions exist, whereas in the absence of strictly common solutions, algorithms that effectively cover the commonly acceptable region are more favorably evaluated.</description>

      <title>Detect and Act: Automated Dynamic Optimizer through Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) are challenging to address due to their complex nature, i.e., dynamic environment variation. Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>COBRA++: Enhanced COBRA Optimizer with Augmented Surrogate Pool and Reinforced Surrogate Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22624v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization problems in realistic world present significant challenges onto optimization algorithms, such as the expensive evaluation issue and complex constraint conditions. COBRA optimizer (including its up-to-date variants) is a representative and effective tool for addressing such optimization problems, which introduces 1) RBF surrogate to reduce online evaluation and 2) bi-stage optimization process to alternate search for feasible solution and optimal solution. Though promising, its design space, i.e., surrogate model pool and selection standard, is still manually decided by human expert, resulting in labor-intensive fine-tuning for novel tasks. In this paper, we propose a learning-based adaptive strategy (COBRA++) that enhances COBRA in two aspects: 1) An augmented surrogate pool to break the tie with RBF-like surrogate and hence enhances model diversity and approximation capability; 2) A reinforcement learning-based online model selection policy that empowers efficient and accurate optimization process. The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties. We have conducted multi-dimensional validation experiments and demonstrate that COBRA++ achieves substantial performance improvement against vanilla COBRA and its adaptive variant. Ablation studies are provided to support correctness of each design component in COBRA++.</description>

      <title>NEXUS: Bit-Exact ANN-to-SNN Equivalence via Neuromorphic Gate Circuits with Surrogate-Free Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100% accuracy across all decay factors $\beta\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $\sigma=0.2$ with &gt;98% gate-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Understanding Transformer Optimization via Gradient Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are difficult to optimize with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and largely rely on adaptive optimizers such as Adam. Despite their empirical success, the reasons behind Adam's superior performance over SGD remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the optimization of Transformer models through the lens of \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the variation in gradient norms across parameter blocks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that gradient heterogeneity, together with Hessian heterogeneity, degrades the convergence of gradient-based methods such as SGD, while sign-based methods are substantially less sensitive to this effect. Adam's coordinate-wise normalization makes its update directions depend mainly on gradient signs, so Adam can be interpreted as a soft variant of SignSGD. Our analysis uses the fact that SGD and SignSGD follow steepest descent directions under different norms, and derives upper bounds on the iteration complexity with implications for learning rate scaling in SignSGD. We further investigate the origin of gradient heterogeneity in Transformer architectures and show that it is strongly influenced by the placement of layer normalization, with Post-LN architectures exhibiting particularly pronounced heterogeneity. Experimental results from fine-tuning Transformers in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analysis.

      <title>Stretching Beyond the Obvious: A Gradient-Free Framework to Unveil the Hidden Landscape of Visual Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering which feature combinations are encoded by visual units is critical to understanding how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is critical to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), a model-agnostic, gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's maximally invariant stimuli, and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter (stretch) the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation downstream (squeeze). To probe adversarial sensitivity, stretching and squeezing are reversed to maximally perturb unit activation while minimizing changes to the upstream representation. Applied to CNNs, SnS revealed invariant transformations that were farther from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed depending on the stage of the image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer representations mainly altered texture and pose. By measuring how well the hierarchical invariant images obtained for L2 robust networks were classified by humans and other observer networks, we discovered a substantial drop in their interpretability when the representation was stretched in deep layers, while the opposite trend was found for standard models.</description>

      <title>Thoughtbubbles: an Unsupervised Method for Parallel Thinking in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers train them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and rely solely on serially-generated, natural-language verbalization. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens requiring more computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Using half of the training budget, Thoughtbubbles outperforms the perplexity and zero-shot evals of both standard decoder LMs and those using non-adaptive parallel computation approaches. These results hold across model sizes from 150M to 1.9B. Thoughtbubbles achieves competitive GSM8K results using half of the baseline's token budget. The implicit nature of our method enables models to begin learning adaptive computation at pretraining time, paving the way to unified train-time and test-time scaling behaviors.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Neural Networks for General Linear Symmetries on Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific and geometric problems exhibit general linear symmetries, yet most equivariant neural networks are built for compact groups or simple vector features, limiting their reuse on matrix-valued data such as covariances, inertias, or shape tensors. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), an exactly GL(n)-equivariant architecture that natively supports matrix-valued and Lie-algebraic features. ReLNs resolve a central stability issue for reductive Lie algebras by introducing a non-degenerate adjoint (conjugation)-invariant bilinear form, enabling principled nonlinear interactions and invariant feature construction in a single architecture that transfers across subgroups without redesign. We demonstrate ReLNs on algebraic tasks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries, Lorentz-equivariant particle physics, uncertainty-aware drone state estimation via joint velocity-covariance processing, learning from 3D Gaussian-splat representations, and EMLP double-pendulum benchmark spanning multiple symmetry groups. ReLNs consistently match or outperform strong equivariant and self-supervised baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and compute, improving the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and providing a practical, reusable backbone for learning with broad linear symmetries.

      <title>AgenticRed: Optimizing Agentic Systems for Automated Red-teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement). This work highlights automated system design as a powerful paradigm for AI safety evaluation that can keep pace with rapidly evolving models.</description>
