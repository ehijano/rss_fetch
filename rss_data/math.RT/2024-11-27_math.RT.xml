      <title>The Tits construction for short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-super-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Tits construction for Lie superalgebras such that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ acts by even derivations and decompose, as $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module, into a direct sum of copies of the adjoint, the natural and the trivial representations.
  This construction generalizes the one provided by Elduque et al in \cite{EBCC23}, and it is possible to described the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superstructure in terms of $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebras as a super version of the defined by Allison. We extend the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction and the Tits-Allison-Gao functor that define a short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superalgebra from a $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebra $(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{M})$. Our setting includes and generalizes both \cite{EBCC23} and Shang's \cite{S22}.</description>

      <title>The Schur-Weyl duality and Invariants for classical Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a comprehensive characterization of invariants of classical Lie superalgebras from the super-analog of the Schur-Weyl duality in a unified way. We establish $\mathfrak{g}$-invariants of the tensor algebra $T(\mathfrak{g})$, the supersymmetric algebra $S(\mathfrak{g})$, and the universal enveloping algebra $\mathrm{U}(\mathfrak{g})$ of a classical Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ corresponding to every element in centralizer algebras and their relationship under supersymmetrization. As a byproduct, we prove that the restriction on $T(\mathfrak{g})^{\mathfrak{g}}$ of the projection from $T(\mathfrak{g})$ to $\mathrm{U}(\mathfrak{g})$ is surjective, which enables us to determine the generators of the center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g})$ except for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{osp}_{2m|2n}$. Additionally, we present an alternative algebraic proof of the triviality of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{p}_n)$. The key ingredient involves a technique lemma related to the symmetric group and Brauer diagrams.</description>

      <title>Dualities of $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches from a once-punctured torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantized $\mathrm{SL}_2$-character variety of a once-punctured torus. We show that this quantized algebra has three $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant subalgebras that are isomorphic to quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. These subalgebras are permuted by the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ mapping class group action. Our results confirm various predictions from the physics literature about 4d $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories and their dualities.</description>

      <title>Periodicity shadows I: A new approach to combinatorics of periodic algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to introduce a new notion of periodicity shadow, which appeared naturally in the study of combinatorics of tame symmetric algebras of period four, or more generally, algebras of generalized quaternion type. For any such an algebra $\La$, we consider its shadow $\bS_\La$, which is the (signed) adjacency matrix of the Gabriel quiver of $\La$. Studying properties of shadows $\bS_\La$ leads us to the definition of the periodicity shadow, which is basically, a skew-symmetric integer matrix satisfying certain set of conditions motivated by the properties of shadows $\bS_\La$. This turned out to be a very useful tool in describing the combinatorics of Gabriel quivers of algebras of generalized quaternion type, not only for algebras with small Gabriel quivers (i.e. up to $6$ vertices), which it was originally desined for. In this paper, we introduce and briefly discuss this notion and present one of its theoretical applications, which shows how significant it is. Namely, the main result of this paper describes the global shape of the Gabriel quivers of algebras of generalized quaternion type, as quivers obtained from some basic shadows by attaching $2$-cycles, and moreover, postion of the $2$-cycles is restricted by precise rules (see the Main Theorem). Computational aspects are reported in the second part.</description>

      <title>On results of certain modules over untwisted affine Liesuperalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2020, finite weight modules have been studied over twisted affine Lie superalgebras. To complete the characterization of modules over affine Lie superalgebras, we need some information regarding modules over untwisted affine Lie superalgebras. There are several known results on representations of twisted affine Lie superalgebras that hold for untwisted cases, and their proofs are just a minor modification of the known ones. In this note, we gather these results for our further use.</description>

Abstract: For an unknown finite group $G$ of automorphisms of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, we find sharp bounds on the number of generic $G$-orbits needed to recover $G$ up to group isomorphism, as well as the number needed to recover $G$ as a concrete set of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>The Derived Unipotent Block of $p$-Adic $\mathrm{GL}_2$ as Perfect Complexes over a dg Schur Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $p$-adic field $F$ of residual cardinality $q$, we provide a triangulated equivalence between the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{B}_{1}(G)_{fg})$ of finitely generated unipotent representations of $G=\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$ and perfect complexes over a dg enriched Schur algebra, in the non-banal case of characteristic $l$ odd dividing $q+1$. The dg Schur algebra is the dg endomorphism algebra of a projective resolution of a direct sum $V$ of the parahoric inductions of the trivial representations of the reductive quotients of $G$, and $V$ is shown to be a classical generator of $D^b(\mathcal{B}_{1}(G)_{fg})$.</description>

      <title>Global Weyl modules for thin Lie algebras are finite-dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of Weyl modules, both local and global, goes back to Chari and Pressley in the case of affine Lie algebras, and has been extensively studied for various Lie algebras graded by root systems. We extend that definition to a certain class of Lie algebras graded by weight lattices and prove that if such a Lie algebra satisfies a natural "thinness" condition, then already the global Weyl modules are finite-dimensional. Our motivating example of a thin Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane vanishing at the origin. We also introduce stratifications of categories of modules over such Lie algebras and identify the corresponding strata categories.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Spencer Cohomologies of D=11 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the degenerate Whittaker functions, we study the Fourier expansion of the Gan-Gurevich lifts which are Hecke eigen quaternionic cusp forms of weight $k$ ($k\geq 2$, even) on the split exceptional group $G_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ which come from elliptic newforms of weight $2k$ without supercuspidal local components. In particular, our results give a partial answer to Gross' conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Jacquet-Langlands functor for $p$-adic locally analytic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the locally analytic theory of infinite level local Shimura varieties. As a main result, we prove that in the case of a duality of local Shimura varieties, the locally analytic vectors of different period sheaves at infinite level are independent of the actions of the $p$-adic Lie groups $G$ and $G_b$ of the two towers; this generalizes a result of Pan for the Lubin-Tate and Drinfeld spaces for $GL_2$. We apply this theory to show that the $p$-adic Jacquet-Langlands functor of Scholze commutes with the passage to locally analytic vectors, and is compatible with central characters of Lie algebras. We also prove that the compactly supported de Rham cohomology of the two towers are isomorphic as smooth representations of $G\times G_b$.</description>

      <title>Trivial extension DG-algebras, unitally positive $A_\infty$-algebras, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To any periodic module over any algebra, this paper introduces an associated trivial extension DG-algebra T. After first passing to a strictly unital $A_\infty$-minimal model, it then constructs a particular $A_\infty$-algebra N, called the unitally positive $A_\infty$-algebra, which roughly speaking describes the identity in degree zero and all the positive cohomology. The object N is fundamental, and can be constructed for any DG-category satisfying very mild assumptions.
  The main application is to birational geometry. When applied to contraction algebras, the construction gives a simple and direct proof of the Donovan-Wemyss conjecture, namely that smooth irreducible 3-fold flops are classified by their contraction algebras, and thus by noncommutative data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the rationality of the capped vertex function with descendents for arbitrary Nakajima quiver varieties with generic stability conditions. We generalise the proof given by Smirnov to the general case, which requires to use techniques of tautological classes rather than the fixed-point basis. This result confirms that the "monodromy" of the capped vertex function is trivial, which gives a strong constraint for the monodromy of the capping operators.</description>

Abstract: We show that certain modular induced representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb F}_q)$ can be written as cokernels of operators acting on symmetric power representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb F}_q)$. When the induction is from the Borel subgroup, respectively the anisotropic torus, the operators involve multiplication by newly defined twisted Dickson polynomials, respectively, twisted Serre operators. Our isomorphisms are explicitly defined using differential operators. As a corollary, we improve some periodicity results for quotients in the theta filtration.</description>

      <title>Poset modules of the $0$-Hecke algebras and related quasisymmetric power sum expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Duchamp--Hivert--Thibon introduced the construction of a right $H_n(0)$-module, denoted as $M_P$, for any partial order $P$ on the set $[n]$. This module is defined by specifying a suitable action of $H_n(0)$ on the set of linear extensions of $P$. In this paper, we refer to this module as the poset module associated with $P$. Firstly, we show that $\bigoplus_{n \ge 0} G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ has a Hopf algebra structure that is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, where $\mathscr{P}(n)$ is the full subcategory of $\textbf{mod-}H_n(0)$ whose objects are direct sums of finitely many isomorphic copies of poset modules and $G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ is the Grothendieck group of $\mathscr{P}(n)$. We also demonstrate how (anti-)automorphism twists interact with these modules, the induction product and restrictions. Secondly, we investigate the (type 1) quasisymmetric power sum expansion of some quasi-analogues $Y_\alpha$ of Schur functions, where $\alpha$ is a composition. We show that they can be expressed as the sum of the $P$-partition generating functions of specific posets, which allows us to utilize the result established by Liu--Weselcouch. Additionally, we provide a new algorithm for obtaining these posets. Using these findings, for the dual immaculate function and the extended Schur function, we express the coefficients appearing in the quasisymmetric power sum expansions in terms of border strip tableaux.</description>

Abstract: Recently, by studying an explicit basis, K\"ock and Laurent give the decomposition of the $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)]$-module of holomorphic forms on the Drinfeld curve. We present a crystalline cohomological proof of a weaker version of this result, without specifying a basis. As a by-product we observe a similar decomposition for the Gelfand--Graev representations.</description>

      <title>Langlands Duality and Invariant Differential Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>

      <title>Root of unity quantum cluster algebras and discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a connection between the subjects of cluster algebras, polynomial identity algebras and discriminants. For this, we define the notion of root of unity quantum cluster algebras and prove that they are polynomial identity algebras. Inside each such algebra we construct a (large) canonical central subalgebra, which can be viewed as a far reaching generalization of the central subalgebras of big quantum groups constructed by De Concini, Kac and Procesi and used in representation theory. Each such central subalgebra is proved to be isomorphic to the underlying classical cluster algebra of geometric type. When the root of unity quantum cluster algebra is free over its central subalgebra, we prove that the discriminant of the pair is a product of powers of the frozen variables times an integer. An extension of this result is also proved for the discriminants of all subalgebras generated by the cluster variables of nerves in the exchange graph. These results can be used for the effective computation of discriminants. As an application we prove an explicit formula for the discriminant of the integral form over ${\mathbb{Z}}[\varepsilon]$ of each quantum unipotent cells of De Concini, Kac and Procesi for arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, where $\varepsilon$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Projective representations of Hecke groups from Topological quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct projective (unitary) representations of Hecke groups from the vector spaces associated with the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory of higher genus surfaces. In particular, we generalize the modular data of Temperley-Lieb-Jones modular categories. We also study some properties of the representation. We show the image group of the representation is infinite at low levels in genus $2$ by explicit computations. We also show the representation is reducible with at least three irreducible summands when the level equals $4l+2$ for $l\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>A note on Combinatorial Invariance of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of an amazing hypercube decomposition and a double shortcut for it, and use these new ideas to formulate a conjecture implying the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group. This conjecture has the advantage of being combinatorial in nature. The appendix by Grant T. Barkley and Christian Gaetz discusses the related notion of double hypercubes and proves an analogous conjecture for these in the case of co-elementary intervals.</description>

      <title>Highest weight category structures on $Rep(B)$ and full exceptional collections on generalized flag varieties over $\mathbb Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs a full exceptional collection in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a generalized flag scheme G/P over Z, by means of a G-linear semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of noetherian representations of P . The ensuing semiorthogonal decompositions are compatible with the Bruhat order on cosets of the Weyl group of P in the Weyl group of G. The construction builds upon the foundational results on B-modules from the works of Mathieu, Polo, and van der Kallen, and upon properties of the Steinberg basis of the T-equivariant K-theory of G/B.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space, where $k$ is an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero. Let $G \subseteq \mathrm{SL}(V)$ be a finite abelian group, and denote by $S$ the $G$-invariant subring of the polynomial ring $k[V]$. It is shown that the singularity category $D_{sg}(S)$ recovers the reduced singular locus of $\mathrm{Spec}(S)$.</description>
