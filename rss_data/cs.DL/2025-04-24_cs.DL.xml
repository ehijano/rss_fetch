      <title>Coverage and metadata completeness and accuracy of African research publications in OpenAlex: A comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike traditional proprietary data sources such as Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS), OpenAlex emphasizes its comprehensiveness. This study analyzes OpenAlex coverage and metadata completeness and accuracy of African research publications. To achieve this, OpenAlex is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals Online (AJOL). First, we examine the coverage of African research publications in OpenAlex relative to Scopus, WoS, and AJOL. Then, we assess and compare the availability and accuracy of metadata in OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS. The findings indicate that OpenAlex offers the most extensive publication coverage. In terms of metadata, OpenAlex provides high coverage for publication and author information, though its coverage of affiliations, references, and funder information is comparatively lower. Metadata accuracy is similarly high for publication and author fields, while affiliation, reference, and funding information show higher rates of missing or incomplete data. Notably, the results demonstrate that both metadata availability and accuracy in OpenAlex improve significantly for publications also indexed in Scopus and WoS. These findings suggest that OpenAlex has the potential to replace proprietary data sources for certain types of analyses. However, for some metadata fields, there remains a trade-off between extensiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analyzing 16,193 LLM Papers for Fun and Profits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape of computer science research, driving significant shifts in research priorities across diverse conferences and fields. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication trend of LLM-related papers in 77 top-tier computer science conferences over the past six years (2019-2024). We approach this analysis from four distinct perspectives: (1) We investigate how LLM research is driving topic shifts within major conferences. (2) We adopt a topic modeling approach to identify various areas of LLM-related topic growth and reveal the topics of concern at different conferences. (3) We explore distinct contribution patterns of academic and industrial institutions. (4) We study the influence of national origins on LLM development trajectories. Synthesizing the findings from these diverse analytical angles, we derive ten key insights that illuminate the dynamics and evolution of the LLM research ecosystem.</description>
