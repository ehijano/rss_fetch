      <title>On the Performance of Short Binary BCH Codes for Ultra-Low Latency Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, polar codes have been considered for communication systems that require high re-liability and ultra-low latency, such as sixth generation (6G) wireless communications. This paper presents simulation results showing that short binary extended BCH (eBCH) codes with low-complexity decoding outperform polar codes for lengths 64 and 128. In the simulations, polar mapping under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is assumed and ordered-statistics decoding (OSD) of eBCH codes is compared with CRC-aided successive-cancellation list decoding (SCLD-CRC) of polar codes of the same lengths and rates. The results indicate that short-length binary eBCH codes achieve lower average bit error rate values (higher reliability) and thus should be considered as strong candidates in communication systems requiring extremely low latency, i.e., short code lengths of up to 128 bits. The eBCH simulation results are obtained with OSD and re-processing order equal to one so that complexity is comparable to SCLD-CRC. Specifically, error performances are quantified of length-64 and selected length-128 eBCH codes with order-1 OSD and polar codes with SCLD-CRC for the same rates and lengths. These results serve to verify that short binary eBCH codes do indeed outperform short polar codes with comparable decoding complexity.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted MIMO CV-QKD at THz Frequencies: Channel Estimation and SKR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system incorporating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to efficiently operate at terahertz (THz) frequencies is considered. The transmitter, Alice, employs continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) to communicate secret keys to the receiver, Bob, which utilizes either homodyne or heterodyne detection. The latter node applies the least-squared approach to estimate the effective MIMO channel gain matrix prior to receiving the secret key, and this estimation is made available to Alice via an error-free feedback channel. An eavesdropper, Eve, is assumed to employ a collective Gaussian entanglement attack on the feedback channel to avail the estimated channel state information. We present a novel closed-form expression for the secret key rate (SKR) performance of the proposed RIS-assisted THz CV-QKD system. The effect of various system parameters, such as the number of RIS elements and their phase configurations, the channel estimation error, and the detector noise, on the SKR performance are studied via numerical evaluation of the derived formula. It is demonstrated that the RIS contributes to larger SKR for larger link distances, and that heterodyne detection is preferable over homodyne at lower pilot symbol powers.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication with Flexible Reflector: Joint Placement and Rotation Optimization for Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive metal reflectors for communication enhancement have appealing advantages such as ultra low cost, zero energy expenditure, maintenance-free operation, long life span, and full compatibility with legacy wireless systems. To unleash the full potential of passive reflectors for wireless communications, this paper proposes a new passive reflector architecture, termed flexible reflector (FR), for enabling the flexible adjustment of beamforming direction via the FR placement and rotation optimization. We consider the multi-FR aided area coverage enhancement and aim to maximize the minimum expected receive power over all locations within the target coverage area, by jointly optimizing the placement positions and rotation angles of multiple FRs. To gain useful insights, the special case of movable reflector (MR) with fixed rotation is first studied to maximize the expected receive power at a target location, where the optimal single-MR placement positions for electrically large and small reflectors are derived in closed-form, respectively. It is shown that the reflector should be placed at the specular reflection point for electrically large reflector. While for area coverage enhancement, the optimal placement is obtained for the single-MR case and a sequential placement algorithm is proposed for the multi-MR case. Moreover, for the general case of FR, joint placement and rotation design is considered for the single-/multi-FR aided coverage enhancement, respectively. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate significant performance gains of FRs over various benchmark schemes under different practical setups in terms of receive power enhancement.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Optimal Transport: A Theoretical Framework for Generative Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport has numerous applications, particularly in machine learning tasks involving generative models. In practice, the transportation process often encounters an information bottleneck, typically arising from the conversion of a communication channel into a rate-limited bit pipeline using error correction codes. While this conversion enables a channel-oblivious approach to optimal transport, it fails to fully exploit the available degrees of freedom. Motivated by the emerging paradigm of generative communication, this paper examines the problem of channel-aware optimal transport, where a block of i.i.d. random variables is transmitted through a memoryless channel to generate another block of i.i.d. random variables with a prescribed marginal distribution such that the end-to-end distortion is minimized. With unlimited common randomness available to the encoder and decoder, the source-channel separation architecture is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the blocklength approaches infinity. On the other hand, in the absence of common randomness, the source-channel separation architecture is generally suboptimal. For this scenario, a hybrid coding scheme is proposed, which partially retains the generative capabilities of the given channel while enabling reliable transmission of digital information. It is demonstrated that the proposed hybrid coding scheme can outperform both separation-based and uncoded schemes.</description>

      <title>A Selective Secure Precoding Framework for MU-MIMO Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Networks Under Limited CSIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust and adaptable secure precoding framework designed to encapsulate a intricate scenario where legitimate users have different information security: secure private or normal public information. Leveraging rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), we formulate the sum secrecy spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multi-eavesdropper. To resolve the challenges including the heterogeneity of security, non-convexity, and non-smoothness of the problem, we initially approximate the problem using a LogSumExp technique. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem. We utilize a power iteration-based method to solve the condition, thereby achieving a superior local optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is further extended to a more realistic scenario involving limited channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To effectively utilize the limited channel information, we employ a conditional average rate approach. Handling the conditional average by deriving useful bounds, we establish a lower bound for the objective function under the conditional average. Then we apply the similar optimization method as for the perfect CSIT case. In simulations, we validate the proposed algorithm in terms of the sum secrecy SE.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Cyclic Codes over Product Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, for the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[x]/\langle f(x) \rangle$ is isomorphic to the product ring $\mathbb{F}_q^{\deg f(x)}$ if and only if $f(x)$ splits over $\mathbb{F}_q$ into distinct factors. We generalize this result to the quotient of the polynomial algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[x_1, x_2,\dots, x_k]$ by the ideal $\langle f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2),\dots, f_k(x_k)\rangle.$ On the other hand, every finite dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ has an orthogonal basis of idempotents with their sum equal to $1_{\mathcal{A}}$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}\cong\mathbb{F}_q^l$ as $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebras, where $l=\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathcal{A}$. We utilize this characterization to study polycyclic codes over $\mathcal{A}$ and get a unique decomposition of polycyclic codes over $\mathcal{A}$ into polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for every such orthogonal basis of $\mathcal{A}$, which is referred to as an $\mathbb{F}_q$-decomposition. An $\mathbb{F}_q$-decomposition enables us to use results of polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ to study polycyclic codes over $\mathcal{A}$; for instance, we show that the annihilator dual of a polycyclic code over $\mathcal{A}$ is a polycyclic code over $\mathcal{A}$. Furthermore, we consider the obvious Gray map (which is obtained by restricting scalars from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathbb{F}_q$) to find and study codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ from codes over $\mathcal{A}$. Finally, with the help of different Gray maps, we produce a good number of examples of MDS or almost-MDS or/and optimal codes; some of them are LCD over $\mathbb{F}_q$.</description>

      <title>Sparse recovery from quadratic equations, part II: hardness and incoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the square root bottleneck in the recovery of sparse vectors from quadratic equations. It is acknowledged that a sparse vector $ \mathbf x_0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\| \mathbf x_0\|_0 = k$ can in theory be recovered from as few as $O(k)$ generic quadratic equations but no polynomial time algorithm is known for this task unless $m = \Omega(k^2)$. This bottleneck was in fact shown in previous work to be essentially related to the initialization of descent algorithms. Starting such algorithms sufficiently close to the planted signal is known to imply convergence to this signal. In this paper, we show that as soon as $m\gtrsim \mu_0^{-2}k \vee \mu_0^{-4}$ (up to log factors) where $\mu_0 = \| \mathbf x_0\|_\infty/\| \mathbf x_0\|_2$, it is possible to recover a $k$-sparse vector $ \mathbf x_0\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ quadratic equations of the form $\langle \mathbf A_i, \mathbf x \mathbf x^\intercal\rangle = \langle \mathbf A_i, \mathbf x_0 \mathbf x_0^\intercal\rangle + \varepsilon_i $ by minimizing the classical empirical loss. The proof idea carries over to the phase retrieval setting for which it provides an original initialization that matches the current optimal sample complexity (see e.g. [Cai 2023]). In the maximally incoherent regime $\mu_0^{-2}=k$, and for $m=o(k^2)$ we provide evidence for topological hardness by showing that a property known as the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), which originated in spin glass theory and is conjectured to be indicative of algorithmic intractability when optimizing over random structures, holds for a particular level of overparametrization. The key ingredient of the proof is a lower bound on the tail of chi-squared random variables which follows from the theory of moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>The Rendezvous Between Extreme Value Theory and Next-generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promising technologies such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output, reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surfaces, non-terrestrial networks, millimetre wave communication, ultra-reliable lowlatency communication are envisioned as the enablers for next-generation (NG) networks. In contrast to conventional communication systems meeting specific average performance requirements, NG systems are expected to meet quality-of-service requirements in extreme scenarios as well. In this regard, extreme value theory (EVT) provides a powerful framework for the design of communication systems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of advances in communication that utilize EVT to characterize the extreme order statistics of interest. We first give an overview of the history of EVT and then elaborate on the fundamental theorems. Subsequently, we discuss different problems of interest in NG communication systems and how EVT can be utilized for their analysis. We finally point out the open challenges and future directions of EVT in NG communication systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, existing ISAC systems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a loss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and communication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless, exploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving regions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance sensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a full-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive MAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and serve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication. We aim to maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication rates (WSR) by jointly designing the transmit beamformers, sensing signal covariance matrices, receive beamformers, and MA positions at the BS, as well as the UL power allocation. The resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve, while we propose an efficient two-layer random position (RP) algorithm to tackle it. In addition, to reduce movement delay and cost, we design an antenna position matching (APM) algorithm based on the greedy strategy to minimize the total MA movement distance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the substantial performance improvement achieved by deploying MAs in near-field ISAC systems. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed APM algorithm in reducing the antenna movement distance, which is helpful for energy saving and time overhead reduction for MA-aided near-field ISAC systems with large moving regions.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Secure ISAC Against Dual Eavesdropping Threats: Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</description>

      <title>An efficient search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs using multivariate information scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a greedy search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs, which include directed as well as bidirected edges, originating from unobserved latent variables. The normalized likelihood score of ancestral graphs is estimated in terms of multivariate information over relevant ``ac-connected subsets'' of vertices, C, that are connected through collider paths confined to the ancestor set of C. For computational efficiency, the proposed two-step algorithm relies on local information scores limited to the close surrounding vertices of each node (step 1) and edge (step 2). This computational strategy, although restricted to information contributions from ac-connected subsets containing up to two-collider paths, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery methods on challenging benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Entropy and Quantum Algorithmic Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A state $\rho=(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence such that $\rho_n$ is a density matrix on $n$ qubits. It formalizes the notion of an infinite sequence of qubits. The von Neumann entropy $H(d)$ of a density matrix $d$ is the Shannon entropy of its eigenvalue distribution. We show: (1) If $\rho$ is a computable quantum Schnorr random state then $\lim_n [H(\rho_n )/n] = 1$. (2) We define quantum s-tests for $s\in [0,1]$, show that $\liminf_n [H(\rho_n)/n]\geq \{ s: \rho$ is covered by a quantum s-test $\}$ for computable $\rho$ and construct states where this inequality is an equality. (3) If $\exists c \exists^\infty n H(\rho_n)&gt; n-c$ then $\rho$ is strong quantum random. Strong quantum randomness is a randomness notion which implies quantum Schnorr randomness relativized to any oracle. (4) A computable state $(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is quantum Schnorr random iff the family of distributions of the $\rho_n$'s is uniformly integrable. We show that the implications in (1) and (3) are strict.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rate Control for Deep Video Compression with Rate-Distortion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep video compression has made significant progress in recent years, achieving rate-distortion performance that surpasses that of traditional video compression methods. However, rate control schemes tailored for deep video compression have not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based $\lambda$-domain rate control scheme for deep video compression, which determines the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each to-be-coded frame based on the rate-distortion-$\lambda$ (R-D-$\lambda$) relationships directly learned from uncompressed frames, achieving high rate control accuracy efficiently without the need for pre-encoding. Moreover, this content-aware scheme is able to mitigate inter-frame quality fluctuations and adapt to abrupt changes in video content. Specifically, we introduce two neural network-based predictors to estimate the relationship between bitrate and $\lambda$, as well as the relationship between distortion and $\lambda$ for each frame. Then we determine the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each frame to achieve the target bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high rate control accuracy at the mini-GOP level with low time overhead and mitigates inter-frame quality fluctuations across video content of varying resolutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptivity can help exponentially for shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in understanding the statistical complexity of learning from quantum data under the constraint that one can only make unentangled measurements. While a key challenge in establishing tight lower bounds in this setting is to deal with the fact that the measurements can be chosen in an adaptive fashion, a recurring theme has been that adaptivity offers little advantage over more straightforward, nonadaptive protocols.
  In this note, we offer a counterpoint to this. We show that for the basic task of shadow tomography, protocols that use adaptively chosen two-copy measurements can be exponentially more sample-efficient than any protocol that uses nonadaptive two-copy measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the theoretical and practical foundations of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models, which leverage stochastic processes and Brownian motion to model complex data distributions. These models employ forward and reverse diffusion processes defined through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to iteratively add and remove noise, enabling high-quality data generation. By analyzing the performance bounds of these models, we demonstrate how score estimation errors propagate through the reverse process and bound the total variation distance using discrete Girsanov transformations, Pinsker's inequality, and the data processing inequality (DPI) for an information theoretic lens.</description>

      <title>Comparing Few to Rank Many: Active Human Preference Learning using Randomized Frank-Wolfe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning of human preferences from a limited comparison feedback. This task is ubiquitous in machine learning. Its applications such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been transformational. We formulate this problem as learning a Plackett-Luce model over a universe of $N$ choices from $K$-way comparison feedback, where typically $K \ll N$. Our solution is the D-optimal design for the Plackett-Luce objective. The design defines a data logging policy that elicits comparison feedback for a small collection of optimally chosen points from all ${N \choose K}$ feasible subsets. The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods for solving D-optimal designs would have $O({N \choose K})$ time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic and open-source NLP datasets.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-augmented Generation for GenAI-enabled Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is an emerging paradigm aiming at transmitting only task-relevant semantic information to the receiver, which can significantly improve communication efficiency. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have empowered GenAI-enabled SemCom (GenSemCom) to further expand its potential in various applications. However, current GenSemCom systems still face challenges such as semantic inconsistency, limited adaptability to diverse tasks and dynamic environments, and the inability to leverage insights from past transmission. Motivated by the success of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the domain of GenAI, this paper explores the integration of RAG in GenSemCom systems. Specifically, we first provide a comprehensive review of existing GenSemCom systems and the fundamentals of RAG techniques. We then discuss how RAG can be integrated into GenSemCom. Following this, we conduct a case study on semantic image transmission using an RAG-enabled diffusion-based SemCom system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed integration. Finally, we outline future directions for advancing RAG-enabled GenSemCom systems.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU networks -- injectivity capacity upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity abilities. The main focus is on \emph{precisely} determining the so-called injectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined as the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which ensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong recent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties is here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that connects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between studying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called (1-extension) $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to statistically handle properties of the extended $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons and implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these we observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we observe a rapid \emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth are sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result that fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and that has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing mathematical methodologies.</description>

      <title>InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19792v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.</description>

Abstract: We present a new result on the nonexistence of generalized bent functions (GBFs)from (Z/tZ)^n to Z/tZ (called type [n, t]) for a large class. Assume p is an odd prime number. By showing certain quadratic norm form equations having no integral points, we obtain a universalresult on the nonexistence of GBFs with type [n,2p^e] when p and n satisfy a certain inequality, and by computational methods with a widely accepted hypothesis, Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we also achieve some results on the nonexistence of GBFs for relatively small p.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximization for UAV-enabled Integrated Periodic Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to revolutionize the existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible joint design. Nevertheless, the existing works on ISAC mainly focus on exploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously during the entire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and communication requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with communication may make it is harder to balance between these two functionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit power. To address this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and communication mechanism for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more flexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities. Specifically, the system achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, user association, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets. Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves closely coupled integer variables, we derive the closed-form optimal beamforming vector to dramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a tight lower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based on the above results, we propose a penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve the considered problem. The optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV location are analyzed under a special case of infinity number of antennas. Furthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without location constraints and propose an efficient algorithm for solving the problem with location constraints.</description>

      <title>Lock-based or Lock-less: Which Is Fresh?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine status updating systems in which time-stamped status updates are stored/written in shared-memory. Specifically, we compare Read-Copy-Update (RCU) and Readers-Writer lock (RWL) as shared-memory synchronization primitives on the update freshness. To demonstrate the tension between readers and writers accessing shared-memory, we consider a network scenario with a pair of coupled updating processes. Location updates of a mobile terminal are written to a shared-memory Forwarder Information Base (FIB) at a network forwarder. An application server sends ``app updates'' to the mobile terminal via the forwarder. Arriving app updates at forwarder are addressed (by reading the FIB) and forwarded to the mobile terminal. If a FIB read returns an outdated address, the misaddressed app update is lost in transit. We redesign these reader and writer processes using preemption mechanisms that improve the timeliness of updates. We present a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework to analyze location and app update age processes and show how these two age processes are coupled through synchronization primitives. Our analysis shows that using a lock-based primitive (RWL) can serve fresher app updates to the mobile terminal at higher location update rates while lock-less (RCU) mechanism favors timely delivery of app updates at lower location update rates.</description>

      <title>Joint Identification and Sensing for Discrete Memoryless Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the identification (ID) scheme proposed by Ahlswede and Dueck, the receiver's goal is simply to verify whether a specific message of interest was sent. Unlike Shannon's transmission codes, which aim for message decoding, ID codes for a Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC) are far more efficient: their size grows doubly exponentially with the blocklength when randomized encoding is used. This indicates that, when the receiver's objective does not require decoding, the ID paradigm is significantly more efficient than traditional Shannon transmission in terms of both energy consumption and hardware complexity. Further benefits of ID schemes can be realized by leveraging additional resources such as feedback. In this work, we address the problem of joint ID and channel state estimation over a DMC with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) state sequences. State estimation functions as the sensing mechanism of the model. Specifically, the sender transmits an ID message over the DMC while simultaneously estimating the channel state through strictly causal observations of the channel output. Importantly, the random channel state is unknown to both the sender and the receiver. For this system model, we present a complete characterization of the ID capacity-distortion function.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity OTFS-Based Over-the-Air Computation Design for Time-Varying Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates over-the-air computation (AirComp) over multiple-access time-varying channels, where devices with high mobility transmit their sensing data to a fusion center (FC) for averaging. To combat the Doppler shift induced by time-varying channels, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Our objective is minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) for the target function estimation. Due to the multipath time-varying channels, the OTFS-based AirComp not only suffers from noise but also interference. Specifically, we propose three schemes, namely S1, S2, and S3, for the target function estimation. S1 directly estimates the target function under the impacts of noise and interference. S2 mitigates the interference by introducing a zero padding-assisted OTFS. In S3, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the function in a matrix form. In the numerical results, we evaluate the performance of S1, S2, and S3 from the perspectives of MSE and computational complexity, and compare them with benchmarks. Specifically, compared to benchmarks, S3 outperforms them with a significantly lower MSE but incurs a higher computational complexity. In contrast, S2 demonstrates a reduction in both MSE and computational complexity. Lastly, S1 shows superior error performance at small SNR and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Coded Downlink Massive Random Access and a Finite de Finetti Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_1,\cdots,X_k)$ to a randomly activated subset of $k$ users, among a large pool of $n$ users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the $k$ active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended, which would require $H(X_1,\cdots,X_k) + k\log(n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of a user is $\log(n)$ bits. For large $n$, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on $n$, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log(k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log(k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed, and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem which is scaling optimal.</description>

Abstract: The trend toward using increasingly large arrays of antenna elements continues. However, fitting more antennas into the limited space available on user equipment (UE) within the currently popular Frequency Range 1 spectrum presents a significant challenge. This limitation constrains the capacity-scaling gains for end users, even when networks support a higher number of antennas. To address this issue, we explore a user-centric collaborative MIMO approach, termed UE-CoMIMO, which leverages several fixed or portable devices within a personal area to form a virtually expanded antenna array. This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze the performance of UE-CoMIMO. Our analytical results demonstrate that UE-CoMIMO can significantly enhance the system's effective channel response within the current communication system without requiring extensive modifications. Further performance improvements can be achieved by optimizing the phase shifters on the expanded antenna arrays at the collaborative devices. These findings are corroborated by ray-tracing simulations. Beyond the simulations, we implemented these collaborative devices and successfully conducted over-the-air validation in a real 5G environment, showcasing the practical potential of UE-CoMIMO. Several practical perspectives are discussed, highlighting the feasibility and benefits of this approach in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Single Antenna Tracking and Localization of RIS-enabled Vehicular Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to be employed in next generation wireless networks to enhance the communication and radio localization services. In this paper, we propose novel localization and tracking algorithms exploiting reflections through RISs at multiple receivers. We utilize a single antenna transmitter (Tx) and multiple single antenna receivers (Rxs) to estimate the position and the velocity of users (e.g. vehicles) equipped with RISs. Then, we design the RIS phase shifts to separate the signals from different users. The proposed algorithms exploit the geometry information of the signal at the RISs to localize and track the users. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization system. Compared to the time of arrival (ToA)-based localization approach, the proposed method reduces the localization error by a factor up to three. Also, the simulation results show the accuracy of the proposed tracking approach.</description>

      <title>Growth-Optimal E-Variables and an extension to the multivariate Csisz\'ar-Sanov-Chernoff Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider growth-optimal e-variables with maximal e-power, both in an absolute and relative sense, for simple null hypotheses for a $d$-dimensional random vector, and multivariate composite alternatives represented as a set of $d$-dimensional means $\meanspace_1$. These include, among others, the set of all distributions with mean in $\meanspace_1$, and the exponential family generated by the null restricted to means in $\meanspace_1$. We show how these optimal e-variables are related to Csisz\'ar-Sanov-Chernoff bounds, first for the case that $\meanspace_1$ is convex (these results are not new; we merely reformulate them) and then for the case that $\meanspace_1$ `surrounds' the null hypothesis (these results are new).</description>

      <title>Democratic Ramp Secret Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the fundamental findings by Chen et al. in [5] on general information transfer in linear ramp secret sharing schemes to conclude that their method not only gives a way to establish worst case leakage [5, 25] and best case recovery [5, 19], but can also lead to additional insight on non-qualifying sets for any prescribed amount of information. We then apply this insight to schemes defined from monomial-Cartesian codes and by doing so we demonstrate that the good schemes from Sec.\ IV in [14] have a second layer of security. Elaborating further, when given a designed recovery number, in a new construction the focus is entirely on ensuring that the access structure possesses desirable second layer security, rather on what is the worst case information leakage in terms of number of participants. The particular structure of largest possible sets being not able to determine given amount of information suggests that we call such schemes democratic</description>

      <title>Two-stage Quantum Estimation and the Asymptotics of Quantum-enhanced Transmittance Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider estimation of a single unknown parameter embedded in a quantum state. Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) is the ultimate limit of the mean squared error for any unbiased estimator. While it can be achieved asymptotically for a large number of quantum state copies, the measurement required often depends on the true value of the parameter of interest. Prior work addresses this paradox using a two-stage approach: in the first stage, a preliminary estimate is obtained by applying, on a vanishing fraction of quantum state copies, a sub-optimal measurement that does not depend on the parameter of interest. In the second stage, the preliminary estimate is used to construct the QCRB-achieving measurement that is applied to the remaining quantum state copies. This is akin to two-step estimators for classical problems with nuisance parameters. Unfortunately, the original analysis imposes conditions that severely restrict the class of classical estimators applied to the quantum measurement outcomes, hindering applications of this method. We relax these conditions to substantially broaden the class of usable estimators for single-parameter problems at the cost of slightly weakening the asymptotic properties of the two-stage method. We also account for nuisance parameters. We apply our results to obtain the asymptotics of quantum-enhanced transmittance sensing.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Power-Aware Learned Optimization for Modular Receive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems play a key role in wireless communication technologies. A widely considered approach to realize scalable MIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules, each with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free massive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue with the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the beampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This leads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved on each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented optimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems, which learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by tackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps with momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the optimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of iterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how power efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via boosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated analog components. Numerical results show that our learn-to-optimize method notably reduces the number of iterations and computation latency required to reliably tune modular MIMO receivers, and that it allows obtaining desirable balances between power efficient designs and throughput.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>
