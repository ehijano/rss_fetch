      <title>Learning Outcomes supporting the integration of Ethical Reasoning into quantitative courses: Three tasks for use in three general contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This 2024 chapter gives a brief overview of cognitive and educational sciences' perspectives on learning outcomes (LOs) to facilitate the integration of LOs specific to ethical reasoning into any mathematics or quantitative course. The target is undergraduate (adult) learners but these LOs can be adapted for earlier and later stages of learning. Core contents of Ethical Reasoning are: 1. its six constituent knowledge, skills, and abilities; 2. a stakeholder analysis; and 3. ethical practice standards or guidelines. These are briefly summarized. Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of cognitive complexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can be adapted repeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These features can support authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and quantitative courses at the tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can be integrated are Assumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation (what if the approximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application appropriate? what if it is not?). One or more of the three core contents of Ethical Reasoning can be added to any problem already utilized in a course (or new ones) by asking learners to apply the core to the context. Engagement with ethical reasoning can prepare students to assume their responsibilities to promote and perpetuate the integrity of their profession across their careers using mathematics, statistics, data science, and other quantitative methods and technologies.</description>

      <title>Is mathematics a game?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared with a game, realizing that a "motley of language games" is the more refined object of comparison. Our analysis owes at least as much to (late) Wittgenstein, updated by a Brandomian emphasis that the rules governing language games be inferential, as to Hilbert, supplemented with some empiricism taken from van Fraassen. Our "motley" provides a coat rack onto which various philosophies of mathematics may be attached and may even peacefully support each other. Pure mathematics is a language game incorporating aspects of formalism and structuralism, modified however by a different notion of truth. Applied mathematics corresponds to a different language game in which mathematical theories provide generalized yardsticks that "measure" (as opposed to: represent) natural phenomena. Thus our framework is non-referential for both pure and applied mathematics. The certainty of pure mathematics in principle resides in proofs, but in practice these must be surveyable'. Hilbert and Wittgenstein proposed almost opposite criteria for surveyability; we try to overcome their difference.</description>

      <title>Richardson varieties, projected Richardson varieties and positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey article on Richardson varieties and their combinatorics. A Richardson variety is the intersection, inside the flag manifold GL_n/B_+, of a Schubert cell (B_- u B_+)/B_+ and an opposite Schubert cell (B_+ w B_+)/B_+ (or the similar intersection of Schubert varieties). In this survey, we provide an overview of what is known about (1) homogeneous coordinate rings of Richardson varieties, their bases and degenerations (2) parametrizations of Richardson varieties using Bott-Samelson varieties (3) Deodhar's decompositions of the flag manifold and of Richardson varieties within it and (4) total positivity in the flag manifold. We also provide an overview of the combinatorics of positroid varieties, their relations to Richardson varieties, and how they are parametrized using plabic graphs. Most of this survey is an overview of other authors' work over the last forty years, but there are also some minor original results: For example, that coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are UFD's (Corollary 3.23), that the Deodhar decomposition is not a stratification in Lie type A (Section 4.3) and explicit descriptions of the Deodhar decomposition in terms of ranks of submatrices (Section 4.4).</description>
