      <title>Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist compares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and repeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by continually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or similarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions have typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow settings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind listening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal loss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on the synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose differentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the available literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design with modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss function performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel and established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with differentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the sixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching trials. Performance was measured using parameter differences, spectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We observed a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures. Our post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly dependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding the scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics tailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing one-size-fits-all solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Audio Fingerprint Robustness to Audio Degradation for Music Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting (AFP) allows the identification of unknown audio content by extracting compact representations, termed audio fingerprints, that are designed to remain robust against common audio degradations. Neural AFP methods often employ metric learning, where representation quality is influenced by the nature of the supervision and the utilized loss function. However, recent work unrealistically simulates real-life audio degradation during training, resulting in sub-optimal supervision. Additionally, although several modern metric learning approaches have been proposed, current neural AFP methods continue to rely on the NT-Xent loss without exploring the recent advances or classical alternatives. In this work, we propose a series of best practices to enhance the self-supervision by leveraging musical signal properties and realistic room acoustics. We then present the first systematic evaluation of various metric learning approaches in the context of AFP, demonstrating that a self-supervised adaptation of the triplet loss yields superior performance. Our results also reveal that training with multiple positive samples per anchor has critically different effects across loss functions. Our approach is built upon these insights and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both a large, synthetically degraded dataset and a real-world dataset recorded using microphones in diverse music venues.</description>

      <title>WavShape: Information-Theoretic Speech Representation Learning for Fair and Privacy-Aware Audio Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity, accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and resource-efficient speech systems.</description>

      <title>A Self-Training Approach for Whisper to Enhance Long Dysarthric Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) enhances the accessibility of smart devices for dysarthric speakers with limited mobility. Previously, DSR research was constrained by the fact that existing datasets typically consisted of isolated words, command phrases, and a limited number of sentences spoken by a few individuals. This constrained research to command-interaction systems and speaker adaptation. The Speech Accessibility Project (SAP) changed this by releasing a large and diverse English dysarthric dataset, leading to the SAP Challenge to build speaker- and text-independent DSR systems. We enhanced the Whisper model's performance on long dysarthric speech via a novel self-training method. This method increased training data and adapted the model to handle potentially incomplete speech segments encountered during inference. Our system achieved second place in both Word Error Rate and Semantic Score in the SAP Challenge.</description>

      <title>TOMI: Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas for Multi-Track Compositions with Full-Song Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy, which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips (short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks (instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure, and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>The Florence Price Art Song Dataset and Piano Accompaniment Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Florence B. Price was a composer in the early 20th century whose music reflects her upbringing in the American South, her African heritage, and her Western classical training. She is noted as the first African-American woman to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra. Her music has recently received renewed attention from both the public and the research community, decades after her death. In addition to other genres, Price was a prolific composer for solo voice and piano. Music historians have documented the existence of 134 art songs and piano/voice arrangements for spirituals and folk songs written by Price. We release a digital catalog of 112 of these works in MuseScore, MusicXML, MIDI, and PDF format. We also use this dataset to fine-tune a symbolic music generation model to generate accompaniments to melodies, and we conduct a blind listening experiment that shows that accompaniments generated by our model are perceived as being reflective of Florence Price's style more frequently than accompaniments generated by a baseline model. We release our model as the Florence Price Piano Accompaniment Generator alongside our dataset.</description>

      <title>XY-Tokenizer: Mitigating the Semantic-Acoustic Conflict in Low-Bitrate Speech Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are available at https://github.com/gyt1145028706/XY-Tokenizer.</description>

      <title>You Sound a Little Tense: L2 Tailored Clear TTS Using Durational Vowel Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language (L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.</description>

      <title>From Large-scale Audio Tagging to Real-Time Explainable Emergency Vehicle Sirens Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework, specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>RELATE: Subjective evaluation dataset for automatic evaluation of relevance between text and audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-audio (TTA) research, the relevance between input text and output audio is an important evaluation aspect. Traditionally, it has been evaluated from both subjective and objective perspectives. However, subjective evaluation is costly in terms of money and time, and objective evaluation is unclear regarding the correlation to subjective evaluation scores. In this study, we construct RELATE, an open-sourced dataset that subjectively evaluates the relevance. Also, we benchmark a model for automatically predicting the subjective evaluation score from synthesized audio. Our model outperforms a conventional CLAPScore model, and that trend extends to many sound categories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Emergent musical properties of a transformer under contrastive self-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.</description>

      <title>StreamFlow: Streaming Flow Matching with Block-wise Guided Attention Mask for Speech Token Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23986v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality, particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block. These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples: https://dukguo.github.io/StreamFlow/}</description>

      <title>Speaker Targeting via Self-Speaker Adaptation for Multi-talker ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe overlapping speech conditions.</description>

      <title>Boosting CTC-Based ASR Using LLM-Based Intermediate Loss Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Entity-Preserved Context-Aware ASR Structured Transcriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data, especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal, financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of 30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30 seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting. Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of spectral-element modeling of wave propagation through the anatomy of marine mammals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>VisionScores -- A system-segmented image score dataset for deep learning tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples, presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author, being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces' metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images are included for further analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup, web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores 92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems. Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.</description>

      <title>Investigating an Overfitting and Degeneration Phenomenon in Self-Supervised Multi-Pitch Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our insights on the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>JAM-Flow: Joint Audio-Motion Synthesis with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths. Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model. JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page: https://joonghyuk.com/jamflow-web</description>

      <title>Human-CLAP: Human-perception-based contrastive language-audio pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) is widely used for audio generation and recognition tasks. For example, CLAPScore, which utilizes the similarity of CLAP embeddings, has been a major metric for the evaluation of the relevance between audio and text in text-to-audio. However, the relationship between CLAPScore and human subjective evaluation scores is still unclarified. We show that CLAPScore has a low correlation with human subjective evaluation scores. Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.25 compared with the conventional CLAP.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Data Curation Matters in Scaling Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of modern speech enhancement systems rely on data-driven neural network models. Conventionally, larger datasets are presumed to yield superior model performance, an observation empirically validated across numerous tasks in other domains. However, recent studies reveal diminishing returns when scaling speech enhancement data. We focus on a critical factor: prevalent quality issues in ``clean'' training labels within large-scale datasets. This work re-examines this phenomenon and demonstrates that, within large-scale training sets, prioritizing high-quality training data is more important than merely expanding the data volume. Experimental findings suggest that models trained on a carefully curated subset of 700 hours can outperform models trained on the 2,500-hour full dataset. This outcome highlights the crucial role of data curation in scaling speech enhancement systems effectively.</description>

      <title>URGENT-PK: Perceptually-Aligned Ranking Model Designed for Speech Enhancement Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is fundamental to speech quality assessment. However, its acquisition requires significant human annotation. Although deep neural network approaches, such as DNSMOS and UTMOS, have been developed to predict MOS to avoid this issue, they often suffer from insufficient training data. Recognizing that the comparison of speech enhancement (SE) systems prioritizes a reliable system comparison over absolute scores, we propose URGENT-PK, a novel ranking approach leveraging pairwise comparisons. URGENT-PK takes homologous enhanced speech pairs as input to predict relative quality rankings. This pairwise paradigm efficiently utilizes limited training data, as all pairwise permutations of multiple systems constitute a training instance. Experiments across multiple open test sets demonstrate URGENT-PK's superior system-level ranking performance over state-of-the-art baselines, despite its simple network architecture and limited training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Re-orchestration is the process of adapting a music piece for a different set of instruments. By altering the original instrumentation, the orchestrator often modifies the musical texture while preserving a recognizable melodic line and ensures that each part is playable within the technical and expressive capabilities of the chosen instruments. In this work, we propose METEOR, a model for generating Melody-aware Texture-controllable re-Orchestration with a Transformer-based variational auto-encoder (VAE). This model performs symbolic instrumental and textural music style transfers with a focus on melodic fidelity and controllability. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. With both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that our model outperforms style transfer models on a re-orchestration task in terms of generation quality and controllability. Moreover, it can be adapted for a lead sheet orchestration task as a zero-shot learning model, achieving performance comparable to a model specifically trained for this task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.</description>

      <title>FreeCodec: A disentangled neural speech codec with fewer tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have gained great attention for their outstanding reconstruction with discrete token representations.
  It is a crucial component in generative tasks such as speech coding and large language models (LLM).
  However, most works based on residual vector quantization perform worse with fewer tokens due to low coding efficiency for modeling complex coupled information.
  In this paper, we propose a neural speech codec named FreeCodec which employs a more effective encoding framework by decomposing intrinsic properties of speech into different components:
  1) a global vector is extracted as the timbre information,
  2) a prosody encoder with a long stride level is used to model the prosody information,

      <title>Spotlight-TTS: Spotlighting the Style via Voiced-Aware Style Extraction and Style Direction Adjustment for Expressive Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Text-to-Music Generation Using Public Domain Movie Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Soundtrack Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre. To facilitate reproducibility and foster future work, we publicly release the dataset, code, and demo.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Song Detection via Lyrics Transcripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore, recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music generators.

      <title>MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.</description>

      <title>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.</description>

      <title>CMI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Music Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.</description>

      <title>Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/deezer/robust-AI-lyrics-detection.</description>

      <title>ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.
