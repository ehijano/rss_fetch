      <title>Generalization of Binet's formula for Fibonacci-type numeric sequences through the use of arithmetic pseudo-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to the study of recurrent sequences by introducing the concept of arithmetic pseudo-operators. Unlike conventional operators, these pseudo-operators are pure complex numbers with specific structural properties, allowing for unprecedented operational reformulations. Represented by the symbols ``$+$'', ``$/$'' (slash), ``$\setminus$'' (aslash), ``$\bot$'', ``$\top$'', and ``$\dashv$'', these operators correspond to rotations in the unit circle of the complex plane and generalize fundamental operations, as seen in the identities ``$1 / 1 \setminus 1 = 0$'' and ``$1 \bot 1 \top 1 \dashv 1 = 0$'', which exhibit behavior analogous to conventional subtraction ``$1 - 1 = 0$''. Based on this structure, we reformulate Binet's equations for the Fibonacci and Tribonacci sequences and outline the path for their generalization to the Tetranacci sequence \cite{koshy}. This new perspective not only enhances the understanding of higher-order recurrences but also suggests potential applications in discrete mathematics and computational algebra, expanding the scope of classical algebraic operations.</description>

      <title>Four cross-ratio maps sets of Points and their Algebraic Structures in a line on Desargues Affine Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces advances in the geometry of the transforms for cross ratio of four points in a line in the Desargues affine plane. The results given here have a clean, based Desargues affine plan axiomatic and definitions of addition and multiplication of points on a line in this plane, and for skew field properties. In this paper are studied, four types of cross-ratio maps sets of points, we discussed about for each of the 4-points of cross-ratio and we will examine the algebraic properties for each case. We are constructing four cross-ratio maps sets $\mathcal{R}^{A}_4=\left\{c_r(X,B;C,D) | \quad \forall X \in \ell^{OI} \right\}$, $\mathcal{R}^{B}_4=\left\{c_r(A,X;C,D) | \quad \forall X \in \ell^{OI} \right\}$, $\mathcal{R}^{C}_4=\left\{c_r(A,B;X,D) | \quad \forall X \in \ell^{OI} \right\}$ and $\mathcal{R}^{D}_4=\left\{c_r(A,B;C,X) | \quad \forall X \in \ell^{OI} \right\}$. We disuse and examine algebraic properties for each case, related to the actions of addition and multiplication of points in $\ell^{OI}$ line in Desargues affine planes, which are produced by these map sets.</description>

      <title>Homotopies and Maps between Eigenvalues of some Generalized Lucas Sequences and the Mandelbrot Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenvalues of companion matrices associated with generalized Lucas sequences, denoted as $\mathcal{L}$, exhibit a striking geometric resemblance to the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$. This work investigates this connection by analyzing the statistical distribution of eigenvalues and constructing a variety of homotopies that map different regions of $\mathcal{L}$ to structurally corresponding subsets of $\mathcal{M}$. In particular, we explore both global and piecewise homotopies, including a sinusoidal interpolation targeting the main cardioid and localized deformations aligned with the periodic bulbs. We also study a variation of the Jungreis map to better capture angular and radial structures. In addition to visual and geometric matching, we classify the eigenvalues according to their dynamical behavior, identifying subsets associated with hyperbolic, parabolic, Misurewicz, and Siegel disk points. Our findings suggest that meaningful correspondences between $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ must integrate both geometric deformation and dynamical classification. In light of these observations, we also suggest a conjectural homeomorphism between $\mathcal{L}$ and a dense subset of the Mandelbrot cardioid boundary, based on the behavior of the sinusoidal homotopy and the eigenvalue accumulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Relationships Between the Divisors of Friends of $10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solitary number is a positive integer that shares its abundancy index only with itself. $10$ is the smallest positive integer suspected to be solitary, but no proof has been established so far. In this paper, we prove that not all half of the exponents of the prime divisors of a friend of 10 are congruent to $1$ modulo $3$. Furthermore, we prove that if $F=5^{2a}\cdot Q^2$ ($Q$ is an odd positive integer coprime to $15$) is a friend of $10$, then $\sigma(5^{2a})+\sigma(Q^2)$ is congruent to $6$ modulo $8$ if and only if $a$ is even, and $\sigma(5^{2a}) + \sigma(Q^2)$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $8$ if and only if $a$ is odd. In addition, if we set $Q={\displaystyle \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(F)}}p_{i}^{a_i}$ and $a=a_1$, where $p_i$ are prime numbers, then we establish that $$F&gt;\frac{25}{81}\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{\omega(F)}(2a_i + 1)^2,$$ in particular $F&gt; 625\cdot 9^{\omega(F)-3}.$</description>

      <title>Exploring the refuge-induced bubbling phenomenon and harvesting in a three species food chain model that incorporates memory effect and odour effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00004</link>

Abstract: In this study, an odour-mediated system is developed and studied. In an odor-mediated systems, the sense of smell or odour of species plays a critical role in the interactions between predators and prey. It is widely recognised in scientific literature that these systems are very common and essential across natural ecosystems. These systems are crucial for various behaviors, including foraging, mating, and avoiding predators. In this paper, it is assumed that the presence of prey odour aids the predator in its hunting efforts. It is assumed that both prey and intermediate predators seek refuge against their respective predators upon detecting the odour of their predators. In other words, the odour of predators assists prey species in evaluating the danger and seeking refuge for hiding. This model incorporates the prey species' harvesting as well. We also explore the impact of fading memory on the system by incorporating fractional derivatives into the model. The conditions for both the existence and local stability of the non-negative equilibria are derived. The current model system undergoes both Hopf and transcritical bifurcation when the parameter values are appropriately chosen. The dynamic behaviour of the system is showcased and thoroughly analysed using a range of diagrams, highlighting the impact of prey refuge and predator odour parameters. This paper extensively examines the long-term impacts of harvesting within the system. The extent to which prey odour influences the system is investigated, and it emerges that prey odour can play a significant function within the system. It has been observed that when individuals within the system have a strong memory, it positively affects the stability of the system. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the model being considered, therefore supporting the analytical conclusions.</description>
