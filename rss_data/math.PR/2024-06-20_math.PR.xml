      <title>The saddlepoint approximation factors over sample paths of recursively compounded processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an identity between the multivariate and univariate saddlepoint approximations applied to sample path probabilities for a certain class of stochastic processes. This class, which we term the recursively compounded processes, includes branching processes and other models featuring sums of a random number of i.i.d. terms; and compound Poisson processes and other L\'evy processes in which the additive parameter is itself chosen randomly. For such processes, $\hat{f}_{X_1,\dotsc,X_N | X_0=x_0}(x_1,\dots,x_N) = \prod_{n=1}^N \hat{f}_{X_n | X_0=x_0,\dots,X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}}(x_n),$ where the left-hand side is a multivariate saddlepoint approximation applied to the random vector $(X_1,\dots,X_N)$ and the right-hand side is a product of univariate saddlepoint approximations applied to the conditional one-step distributions given the past. Two proofs are given. The first proof is analytic, based on a change-of-variables identity linking the functions that arise in the respective saddlepoint approximations. The second proof is probabilistic, based on a representation of the saddlepoint approximation in terms of tilted distributions, changes of measure, and relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Feller's test for explosions of stochastic Volterra equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a Feller's test for explosions of one-dimensional continuous stochastic Volterra processes of convolution type. The study focuses on dynamics governed by nonsingular kernels, which preserve the semimartingale property of the processes and introduce memory features through a path-dependent drift. In contrast to the classical path-independent case, the sufficient condition derived in this study for a Volterra process to remain in the interior of an interval is generally more restrictive than the necessary condition. The results are illustrated with three specifications of the dynamics: the Volterra square-root diffusion, the Volterra Jacobi process and the Volterra power-type diffusion. For the Volterra square-root diffusion, also known as the Volterra CIR process, the paper presents a detailed discussion on the approximation of the singular fractional kernel with a sum of exponentials, a method commonly employed in the mathematical finance literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants in concentration inequalities on the sphere and in the Gauss space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show several variants of concentration inequalities on the sphere stated as subgaussian estimates with optimal constants. For a Lipschitz function, we give one-sided and two-sided bounds for deviation from the median as well as from the mean. For example, we show that if $\mu$ is the normalized surface measure on $S^{n-1}$ with $n\geq 3$, $f : S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $1$-Lipschitz, $M$ is the median of $f$, and $t &gt;0$, then $\mu\big(f \geq M +t\big) \leq \frac 12 e^{-nt^2/2}$. If $M$ is the mean of $f$, we have a two-sided bound $\mu\big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-nt^2/2}$. Consequently, if $\gamma$ is the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ (again, $1$-Lipschitz, with the mean equal to $M$), then $\gamma \big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-t^2/2}$. These bounds are slightly better and arguably more elegant than those available elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>Self-normalized Sums in Free Probability Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the distribution of self-normalized sums of free self-adjoint random variables converges weakly to Wigner's semicircle law under appropriate conditions and estimate the rate of convergence in terms of the Kolmogorov distance. In the case of free identically distributed self-adjoint bounded random variables, we retrieve the standard rate of order $n^{-1/2}$ up to a logarithmic factor, whereas we obtain a rate of order $n^{-1/4}$ in the corresponding unbounded setting. These results provide free versions of certain self-normalized limit theorems in classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Strong existence and uniqueness of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation, whose volatility coefficient depends on the conditional distribution of the second component with respect to the first component. We prove the strong existence and uniqueness of the solution, establishing the well-posedness of a two-factor local stochastic volatility (LSV) model calibrated to the market prices of European call options. In the spirit of [Jourdain and Zhou, 2020, Existence of a calibrated regime switching local volatility model.], we assume that the factor driving the volatility of the log-price takes finitely many values. Additionally, the propagation of chaos of the particle system is established, giving theoretical justification for the algorithm [Julien Guyon and Henry-Labord\`ere, 2012, Being particular about calibration.].</description>

      <title>Multicoloured Hardcore Model: Fast Mixing and Queueing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the hardcore model to a multicoloured version: a subset of vertices of a graph are coloured such that no vertex is adjacent to one of the same colour; uncoloured vertices do not constrain neighbours. This mathematically models multi-channel resource sharing, such as fibreoptic routing.
  We analyse certain simple Glauber-type dynamics on such configurations, and find conditions which ensure fast mixing. These dynamics model a queueing system: customers queue for service at vertices, who only serve customers whilst they are coloured in the underlying configuration; uncoloured vertices sit idle. The mixing estimates are applied to control queue lengths in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>GROD: Enhancing Generalization of Transformer with Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer networks excel in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, they face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, that is, data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish data that deviates from the expected distribution, while maintaining optimal performance on in-distribution (ID) data. This paper introduces a novel approach based on OOD detection, termed the Generate Rounded OOD Data (GROD) algorithm, which significantly bolsters the generalization performance of transformer networks across various tasks. GROD is motivated by our new OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformer. The transformer has learnability in terms of OOD detection that is, when the data is sufficient the outlier can be well represented. By penalizing the misclassification of OOD data within the loss function and generating synthetic outliers, GROD guarantees learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inlier and outlier. This strategy demonstrates robust adaptability and general applicability across different data types. Evaluated across diverse OOD detection tasks in NLP and CV, GROD achieves SOTA regardless of data format. On average, it reduces the SOTA FPR@95 from 21.97% to 0.12%, and improves AUROC from 93.62% to 99.98% on image classification tasks, and the SOTA FPR@95 by 12.89% and AUROC by 2.27% in detecting semantic text outliers. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GROD-OOD-Detection-with-transformers-B70F.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and CLT for the Ground State of the Disordered Monomer-Dimer Model on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the disordered monomer-dimer model does not admit infinite volume incongruent ground states in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ which can be obtained as a limit of finite volume ground states. Furthermore, we also prove that these ground states are stable under perturbation of the weights in a precise sense.
  As an application, we obtain a CLT for the ground state weight for a growing sequence of tori. Our motivation stems from a similar and long standing open question for the short range Edwards-Anderson spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on the high-dimensional Hamming graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the random $r$-neighbour bootstrap percolation process on a graph $G$, a set of initially infected vertices is chosen at random by retaining each vertex of $G$ independently with probability $p\in (0,1)$, and "healthy" vertices get infected in subsequent rounds if they have at least $r$ infected neighbours. A graph $G$ \emph{percolates} if every vertex becomes eventually infected. A central problem in this process is to determine the critical probability $p_c(G,r)$, at which the probability that $G$ percolates passes through one half. In this paper, we study random $2$-neighbour bootstrap percolation on the $n$-dimensional Hamming graph $\square_{i=1}^n K_k$, which is the graph obtained by taking the Cartesian product of $n$ copies of the complete graph $K_k$ on $k$ vertices. We extend a result of Balogh and Bollob\'{a}s [Bootstrap percolation on the hypercube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 134 (2006), no. 4, 624-648. MR2214907] about the asymptotic value of the critical probability $p_c(Q^n,2)$ for random $2$-neighbour bootstrap percolation on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q^n=\square_{i=1}^n K_2$ to the $n$-dimensional Hamming graph $\square_{i=1}^n K_k$, determining the asymptotic value of $p_c\left(\square_{i=1}^n K_k,2\right)$, up to multiplicative constants (when $n \rightarrow \infty$), for arbitrary $k \in \mathbb N$ satisfying $2 \leq k\leq 2^{\sqrt{n}}$.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data has a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updating this coefficient over time forms a dynamic strategy approaching the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies is universally guaranteed under specific stochastic markets. Furthermore, in stationary and ergodic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on observed past market information during investment, almost surely does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>Sharp oracle inequalities and universality of the AIC and FPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two landmark papers, Akaike introduced the AIC and FPE, demonstrating their significant usefulness for prediction. In subsequent seminal works, Shibata developed a notion of asymptotic efficiency and showed that both AIC and FPE are optimal, setting the stage for decades-long developments and research in this area and beyond. Conceptually, the theory of efficiency is universal in the sense that it (formally) only relies on second-order properties of the underlying process $(X_t)_{t\in \mathbb{Z}}$, but, so far, almost all (efficiency) results require the much stronger assumption of a linear process with independent innovations. In this work, we establish sharp oracle inequalities subject only to a very general notion of weak dependence, establishing a universal property of the AIC and FPE. A direct corollary of our inequalities is asymptotic efficiency of these criteria. Our framework contains many prominent dynamical systems such as random walks on the regular group, functionals of iterated random systems, functionals of (augmented) Garch models of any order, functionals of (Banach space valued) linear processes, possibly infinite memory Markov chains, dynamical systems arising from SDEs, and many more.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with tight boundaries and the Zhukovsky transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider maps with tight boundaries, i.e. maps whose boundaries have minimal length in their homotopy class, and discuss the properties of their generating functions $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ for fixed genus $g$ and prescribed boundary lengths $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, with a control on the degrees of inner faces. We find that these series appear as coefficients in the expansion of $\omega^{(g)}_n(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$, a fundamental quantity in the Eynard-Orantin theory of topological recursion, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of the Zhukovsky transformation used in this context. This interpretation results from the so-called trumpet decomposition of maps with arbitrary boundaries. In the planar bipartite case, we obtain a fully explicit formula for $T^{(0)}_{2\ell_1,\ldots,2\ell_n}$ from the Collet-Fusy formula. We also find recursion relations satisfied by $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$, which consist in adding an extra tight boundary, keeping the genus $g$ fixed. Building on a result of Norbury and Scott, we show that $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ is equal to a parity-dependent quasi-polynomial in $\ell_1^2,\ldots,\ell_n^2$ times a simple power of the basic generating function $R$. In passing, we provide a bijective derivation in the case $(g,n)=(0,3)$, generalizing a recent construction of ours to the non bipartite case.</description>

      <title>A variational perspective on the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the position and velocity of particles under the influence of external confinement, interaction, friction, and stochastic force. It is well-known that this equation can be formally seen as a dissipative Hamiltonian system in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In order to better understand this geometric formalism, we introduce a time-discrete variational scheme, solutions of which converge to the solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as time-step vanishes. The implicit scheme is based on the symplectic Euler scheme, and updates the probability density at each iteration first in the velocity variable then in the position variable.
  The algorithm leverages the geometric structure of the Wasserstein space, and has several desirable properties. Energy functionals involved in each variational problem are geodesically-convex, which implies the unique solvability of the problem. Furthermore, the correct dissipation of the Hamiltonian is observed at the discrete level up to higher order errors.</description>

      <title>On one-step numerical schemes of weak convergence for SDEs with super-linear coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider weak convergence of one-step schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with one-sided Lipschitz conditions. It is known that the super-linear coefficients may lead to a blowup of moments of solutions and their numerical solutions. When solutions to SDEs have all finite moments, weak convergence of numerical schemes has been investigated in [Wang et al (2023), Weak error analysis for strong approximation schemes of SDEs with super-linear coefficients, IMA Journal numerical analysis]. Some modified Euler schemes have been analyzed for weak convergence. In this work, we present a family of explicit schemes of first and second-order weak convergence based on classical schemes for SDEs. We explore the effects of limited moments on these schemes. We provide a systematic but simple way to establish weak convergence orders for schemes based on approximations/modifications of drift and diffusion coefficients. We present several numerical examples of these schemes and show their weak convergence orders.</description>

      <title>Bridging bulk and surface: An interacting particle system towards the field-road diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recover the so-called field-road diffusion model as the hydrodynamic limit of an interacting particle system. The former consists of two parabolic PDEs posed on two sets of different dimensions (a "field" and a "road" in a population dynamics context), and coupled through exchange terms between the field's boundary and the road. The latter stands as a Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP): particles evolve on two microscopic lattices following a Markov jump process, with the constraint that each site cannot host more than one particle at the same time. The system is in contact with reservoirs that allow to create or remove particles at the boundary sites. The dynamics of these reservoirs are slowed down compared to the diffusive dynamics, to reach the reactions and the boundary conditions awaited at the macroscopic scale. This issue of bridging two spaces of different dimensions is, as far as we know, new in the hydrodynamic limit context, and raises perspectives towards future related works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study random instances of the classical marginal problem. We encode the problem in a graph, where the vertices have assigned fixed binary probability distributions, and edges have assigned random bivariate distributions having the incident vertex distributions as marginals. We provide estimates on the probability that a joint distribution on the graph exists, having the bivariate edge distributions as marginals. Our study is motivated by Fine's theorem in quantum mechanics. We study in great detail the graphs corresponding to CHSH and Bell-Wigner scenarios providing rations of volumes between the local and non-signaling polytopes.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimation via Differentiable Metropolis-Hastings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metropolis-Hastings estimates intractable expectations - can differentiating the algorithm estimate their gradients? The challenge is that Metropolis-Hastings trajectories are not conventionally differentiable due to the discrete accept/reject steps. Using a technique based on recoupling chains, our method differentiates through the Metropolis-Hastings sampler itself, allowing us to estimate gradients with respect to a parameter of otherwise intractable expectations. Our main contribution is a proof of strong consistency and a central limit theorem for our estimator under assumptions that hold in common Bayesian inference problems. The proofs augment the sampler chain with latent information, and formulate the estimator as a stopping tail functional of this augmented chain. We demonstrate our method on examples of Bayesian sensitivity analysis and optimizing a random walk Metropolis proposal.</description>

      <title>Utility maximization in constrained and unbounded financial markets: Applications to indifference valuation, regime switching, consumption and Epstein-Zin recursive utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.00199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This memoir presents a systematic study of utility maximization problems for an investor in constrained and unbounded financial markets. Building upon the foundational work of Hu et al. (2005) [Ann. Appl. Probab., 15, 1691--1712] in a bounded framework, we extend our analysis to more challenging unbounded cases. Our methodology combines quadratic backward stochastic differential equations with unbounded solutions and convex duality methods. Central to our approach is the verification of the finite entropy condition, which plays a pivotal role in solving the underlying utility maximization problems and establishing the martingale property and convex duality representation of the value processes. Through four distinct applications, we first study utility indifference valuation of financial derivatives with unbounded payoffs, uncovering novel asymptotic behavior as the risk aversion parameter approaches zero or infinity. Furthermore, we study the regime switching market model with unbounded random endowments and consumption-investment problems with unbounded random endowments, both constrained to portfolios chosen from a convex and closed set. Finally, we investigate investment-consumption problems involving an investor with Epstein-Zin recursive utility in an unbounded financial market.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time convergence of a Fleming-Viot process, in the case where the underlying process is a metastable diffusion killed when it reaches some level set. Through a coupling argument, we establish the long-time convergence of the Fleming-Viot process toward some stationary measure at an exponential rate independent of $N$, the size of the system, as well as uniform in time propagation of chaos estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the fast-slow motions setups in the discrete time $X^\epsilon((n+1)\epsilon)=X^\epsilon(n\epsilon)+\epsilon B(X^\epsilon(n\epsilon),\xi(n))$, $n=0,1,...,[T/\epsilon]$ and the continuous time $\frac {dX^\epsilon(t)}{dt}=B(X^\epsilon(t),\xi(t/\epsilon)).\, t\in [0,T]$ where $B$ is a smooth vector function and $\xi$ is a sufficiently fast mixing stationary stochastic process. It is known since 1966 (Khasminskii) that if $\bar X$ is the averaged motion then $G^\epsilon=\epsilon^{-1/2}(X^\epsilon-\bar X)$ weakly converges to a Gaussian process $G$. We will show that for each $\epsilon$ the processes $\xi$ and $G$ can be redefined on a sufficiently rich probability space without changing their distributions so that $E\sup_{0\leq t\leq T}|G^\epsilon(t)-G(t)|^{2M} =O(\epsilon^{\delta})$, $\delta&gt;0$ which gives also $O(\epsilon^{\delta/3})$ Prokhorov distance estimate between the distributions of $G^\epsilon$ and $G$. In the product case $B(x,\xi)=\Sigma(x)\xi$ we obtain almost sure convergence estimates of the form $\sup_{0\leq t\leq T}|G^\epsilon(t)-G(t)|=O(\epsilon^\delta)$ a.s., as well as the functional form of the law of iterated logarithm for $G^\epsilon$.
  We note that our mixing assumptions are adapted to fast motions generated by important classes of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On Decomposition of the Last Passage Time of Diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a regular transient diffusion, we provide a decomposition of its last passage time to a certain state $\alpha$. This is accomplished by transforming the original diffusion into two diffusions using the occupation time of the area above and below $\alpha$. Based on these two processes, both having a reflecting boundary at $\alpha$, we derive the decomposition formula of the Laplace transform of the last passage time explicitly in a simple form in terms of Green functions. This equation also leads to the Green function's decomposition formula. We demonstrate an application of these formulas to a diffusion with two-valued parameters.</description>

Abstract: Building on previous work on the stochastic analysis for Grassmann random variables, we introduce a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) which provides a stochastic quantisation of Grassmann measures. Our method is inspired by the so-called continuous renormalisation group, but avoids the technical difficulties encountered in the direct study of the flow equation for the effective potentials. As an application, we construct a family of weakly coupled subcritical Euclidean fermionic field theories and prove exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Regularity of laws via Dirichlet forms -- Application to quadratic forms in independent and identically distributed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the law of a quadratic form $Q(X,X)$, evaluated in a sequence $X = (X_{i})$ of independent and identically distributed random variables, when $X_{1}$ can be expressed as a sufficiently smooth function of a Gaussian field. This setting encompasses a large class of important and frequently used distributions, such as, among others, Gaussian, Beta, for instance uniform, Gamma distributions, or else any polynomial transform of them.
  Let us present an emblematic application. Take $X = (X_{i})$ a sequence of independent and identically distributed centered random variables, with unit variance, following such distribution. Consider also $(Q_{n})$ a sequence of quadratic forms, with associated symmetric Hilbert--Schmidt operators $(\mathsf{A}^{(n)})$. Assume that $\operatorname{Tr}[ (\mathsf{A}^{(n)})^{2} ] = 1/2$, $\mathsf{A}^{(n)}_{ii} =0$, and the spectral radius of $\mathsf{A}^{(n)}$ tends to $0$. Then, $(Q_{n}(X))$ converges in a strong sense to the standard Gaussian distribution. Namely, all derivatives of the densities, which are well-defined for $n$ sufficiently large, converge uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$ to the corresponding derivatives of the standard Gaussian density.
  While classical methods, from Malliavin calculus or $\Gamma$-calculus, generally consist in bounding negative moments of the so-called \emph{carr\'e du champ} operator $\Gamma(Q(X),Q(X))$, we provide a new paradigm through a second-order criterion involving the eigenvalues of a Hessian-type matrix related to $Q(X)$. This Hessian is built by iterating twice a tailor-made gradient, the \emph{sharp operator} $\sharp$, obtained via a Gaussian representation of the carr\'e du champ. We believe that this method, recently developed by the authors in the current paper and in their companion paper [AoP 52 n{\deg}3 (2024)] , is of independent interest and could prove useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits and universality: Critical percolation on weighted graphs converging to an $L^3$ graphon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general universality technique for establishing metric scaling limits of critical random discrete structures exhibiting mean-field behavior that requires four ingredients: (i) from the barely subcritical regime to the critical window, components merge approximately like the multiplicative coalescent, (ii) asymptotics of the susceptibility functions are the same as that of the Erdos-Renyi random graph, (iii) asymptotic negligibility of the maximal component size and the diameter in the barely subcritical regime, and (iv) macroscopic averaging of distances between vertices in the barely subcritical regime.
  As an application of the general universality theorem, we establish, under some regularity conditions, the critical percolation scaling limit of graphs that converge, in a suitable topology, to an $L^3$ graphon. In particular, we define a notion of the critical window in this setting. The $L^3$ assumption ensures that the model is in the Erdos-Renyi universality class and that the scaling limit is Brownian. Our results do not assume any specific functional form for the graphon. As a consequence of our results on graphons, we obtain the metric scaling limit for Aldous-Pittel's RGIV model [9] inside the critical window.
  Our universality principle has applications in a number of other problems including in the study of noise sensitivity of critical random graphs [52]. In [10], we use our universality theorem to establish the metric scaling limit of critical bounded size rules. Our method should yield the critical metric scaling limit of Rucinski and Wormald's random graph process with degree restrictions [56] provided an additional technical condition about the barely subcritical behavior of this model can be proved.</description>

Abstract: We show non-asymptotic exponential convergence of Sinkhorn iterates to the Schr\"odinger potentials, solutions of the quadratic Entropic Optimal Transport problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our results hold under mild assumptions on the marginal inputs: in particular, we only assume that they admit an asymptotically positive log-concavity profile, covering as special cases log-concave distributions and bounded smooth perturbations of quadratic potentials. Up to the authors' knowledge, these are the first results which establish exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm in a general setting without assuming bounded cost functions or compactly supported marginals.</description>

Abstract: We prove weak uniqueness of mild solutions for general classes of SPDEs on a Hilbert space. The main novelty is that the drift is only defined on a Sobolev-type subspace and no H\"older-continuity assumptions are required. This framework turns out to be effective to achieve novel uniqueness results for several specific examples. Such wide range of applications is obtained by exploiting either coloured or rougher-than-cylindrical noises.</description>

Abstract: The embedding problem of Markov matrices in Markov semigroups is a classic problem that regained a lot of impetus and activities through recent needs in phylogeny and population genetics. Here, we give an account for dimensions $d\leqslant 4$, including a complete and simplified treatment of the case $d=3$, and derive the results in a systematic fashion, with an eye on the potential applications.
  Further, we reconsider the setup of the corresponding problem for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, which is needed for real-world applications because transition rates need not be constant over time. Additional cases of this more general embedding occur for any $d\geqslant 3$. We review the known case of $d=3$ and describe the setting for future work on $d=4$.</description>

Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since response lags are essential in the feedback loops and are required by most physical systems, it is more appropriate to stabilize McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) with common noise through the implementation of delay feedback control mechanisms. The aim of this paper is to design delay feedback control functions of the system state such that the controlled system to be boundedness in infinite horizon and further exponentially stable in the mean square. The designed controller, which depends only on the system state is easier to implement than that in [27] which was designed to depend on both system state and measure. The existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the controlled system is proved. The It\^o formula with respect to both state and measure is derived. The proposed delay feedback control strategies are rendered viable for effective stabilization of MV-SDEs with common noise. Furthermore, the moment Lyapunov exponent, which is intricately linked to the time delays, is meticulously estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note studies monotone Markov chains, a subclass of Markov chains with extensive applications in operations research and economics. While the properties that ensure the global stability of these chains are well studied, their establishment often relies on the fulfillment of a certain splitting condition. We address the challenges of verifying the splitting condition by introducing simple, applicable conditions that ensure global stability. The simplicity of these conditions is demonstrated through various examples including autoregressive processes, portfolio allocation problems and resource allocation dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For normalized sums $Z_n$ of i.i.d. random variables, we explore necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee the normal approximation with respect to the R\'enyi divergence of infinite order. In terms of densities $p_n$ of $Z_n$, this is a strengthened variant of the local limit theorem taking the form $\sup_x (p_n(x) - \varphi(x))/\varphi(x) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence in the Hall-Janson coverage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a spherical Poisson Boolean model $Z$ in Euclidean $d$-space with $d \geq 2$, with Poisson intensity $t$ and radii distributed like $rY$ with $r \geq 0$ a scaling parameter and $Y$ a fixed nonnegative random variable with finite $(2d)$-th moment. Let $A \subset {\bf R}^d$ be compact with a nice boundary. Let $\alpha $ be the expected volume of a ball of radius $Y$, and suppose $r=r(t)$ is chosen so that $\alpha t r^d - \log t - (d-1) \log \log t$ is a constant indepenent of $t$. A classical result of Hall and of Janson determines the (non-trivial) large-$t$ limit of the probability that $A$ is fully covered by $Z$. In this paper we provide an $O((\log \log t)/\log t)$ bound on the rate of convergence in that result. With a slight adjustment to $r(t)$, this can be improved to $O(1/\log t)$.</description>

      <title>Higher order approximation of nonlinear SPDEs with additive space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider strong approximations of $1+1$-dimensional stochastic PDEs driven by additive space-time white noise. It has been long proposed (Davie-Gaines '01, Jentzen-Kloeden '08), as well as observed in simulations, that approximation schemes based on samples from the stochastic convolution, rather than from increments of the underlying Wiener processes, should achieve significantly higher convergence rates with respect to the temporal timestep. The present paper proves this. For a large class of nonlinearities, with possibly superlinear growth, a temporal rate of (almost) $1$ is proven, a major improvement on the rate $1/4$ that is known to be optimal for schemes based on Wiener increments. The spatial rate remains (almost) $1/2$ as it is standard in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the predictable representation property in the progressive enlargement F^\tau of a reference filtration F by a random time \tau. Our approach is based on the decomposition of any random time into two parts, one overlapping F-stopping times (thin part) and the other one that avoids F-stopping times (thick part). We assume that the F-thin part of \tau is nontrivial and prove a martingale representation theorem on F^\tau. We thus extend previous results dealing with F-avoiding random times. We collect some examples of application to the enlargement of the natural filtration of a L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>Markovian Lifts of Stochastic Volterra Equations in Sobolev Spaces: Solution theory, an Ito Formula and Invariant Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Markovian lifts of stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) with completely monotone kernels and general coefficients within a class of weighted Sobolev spaces. Our primary focus is developing a comprehensive solution theory for a class of non-local stochastic evolution equations (SEEs) encompassing these Markovian lifts. This enables us to provide conditions for the existence of invariant measures for the lifted processes and the corresponding SVE. Another key contribution is an Ito-type formula for the stochastic Volterra equations under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.05757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the rank of a random matrix over an arbitrary field with prescribed numbers of non-zero entries in each row and column. As an application we obtain a formula for the rate of low-density parity check codes. This formula vindicates a conjecture of Lelarge (2013). The proofs are based on coupling arguments and a novel random perturbation, applicable to any matrix, that diminishes the number of short linear relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of [49], but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel $Q$-learning algorithm tailored to solve distributionally robust Markov decision problems where the corresponding ambiguity set of transition probabilities for the underlying Markov decision process is a Wasserstein ball around a (possibly estimated) reference measure. We prove convergence of the presented algorithm and provide several examples also using real data to illustrate both the tractability of our algorithm as well as the benefits of considering distributional robustness when solving stochastic optimal control problems, in particular when the estimated distributions turn out to be misspecified in practice.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Results for Moreau-Yosida Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed class of MCMC methods which uses proximity maps instead of gradients to build proposal mechanisms which can be employed for both differentiable and non-differentiable targets. These methods have been shown to be stable for a wide class of targets, making them a valuable alternative to Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms (MALA); and have found wide application in imaging contexts. The wider stability properties are obtained by building the Moreau-Yosida envelope for the target of interest, which depends on a parameter $\lambda$. In this work, we investigate the optimal scaling problem for this class of algorithms, which encompasses MALA, and provide practical guidelines for the implementation of these methods.</description>

      <title>Muller's ratchet in a near-critical regime: tournament versus fitness proportional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical variant considers {\it fitness proportional} selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al. ([EPW09]) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the ``near-critical'' regime that was in the focus of [EPW09] (and in which the mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as $N\to \infty$). Using a Moran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click rate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet) follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.
  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of dual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph with a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio remains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics of the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between clicks. We will describe how these ideas can be extended to the near-critical regime in which the mutation-selection ratio of the tournament ratchet converges to 1 as $N\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random walks on the lampshuffler group $\mathrm{FSym}(H)\rtimes H$, where $H$ is a finitely generated group and $\mathrm{FSym}(H)$ is the group of finitary permutations of $H$. We show that for any step distribution $\mu$ with a finite first moment that induces a transient random walk on $H$, the permutation coordinate of the random walk almost surely stabilizes pointwise. Our main result states that for $H=\mathbb{Z}$, the above convergence completely describes the Poisson boundary of the random walk $(\mathrm{FSym}(\mathbb{Z})\rtimes \mathbb{Z},\mu)$.</description>

      <title>Time-inconsistent mean-field stopping problems: A regularized equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the mean-field Markov decision process (MDP) with the centralized stopping under the non-exponential discount. The problem differs fundamentally from most existing studies on mean-field optimal control/stopping due to its time inconsistency by nature. We look for the subgame perfect relaxed equilibria, namely the randomized stopping policies that satisfy the time-consistent planning with future selves from the perspective of the social planner. On the other hand, unlike many previous studies on time-inconsistent stopping where the decreasing impatience plays a key role, we are interested in the general discount function without imposing any conditions. As a result, the study on the relaxed equilibrium becomes necessary as the pure-strategy equilibrium may not exist in general. We formulate relaxed equilibria as fixed points of a complicated operator, whose existence is challenging by a direct method. To overcome the obstacles, we first introduce the auxiliary problem under the entropy regularization on the randomized policy and the discount function, and establish the existence of the regularized equilibria as fixed points to an auxiliary operator via Schauder fixed point theorem. Next, we show that the regularized equilibrium converges as the regularization parameter $\lambda$ tends to $0$ and the limit corresponds to a fixed point to the original operator, and hence is a relaxed equilibrium. We also establish some connections between the mean-field MDP and the N-agent MDP when $N$ is sufficiently large in our time-inconsistent setting.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Dirichlet problem on a bounded domain whose Hamiltonian is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operator with merely continuous and bounded coefficients. The objective of this paper is to study the existence of viscosity solutions from a stochastic point of view. Using a relaxed control framework, we define a candidate for a viscosity solution, we prove that this stochastic solution satisfies viscosity sub- and supersolution properties and we establish a strong Markov selection principle, which shows that the stochastic solution can be realized through a strong Markov family. Building on the selection principle, we investigate regularity properties of the stochastic solution. For certain elliptic cases, we connect the strong Markov selection to a Feller selection, which entails the continuity of the stochastic solution.</description>
