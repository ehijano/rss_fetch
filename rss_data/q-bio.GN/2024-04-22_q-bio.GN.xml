      <title>F5C-finder: An Explainable and Ensemble Biological Language Model for Predicting 5-Formylcytidine Modifications on mRNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a prevalent and dynamically regulated epigenetic modification, 5-formylcytidine (f5C) is crucial in various biological processes. However, traditional experimental methods for f5C detection are often laborious and time-consuming, limiting their ability to map f5C sites across the transcriptome comprehensively. While computational approaches offer a cost-effective and high-throughput alternative, no recognition model for f5C has been developed to date. Drawing inspiration from language models in natural language processing, this study presents f5C-finder, an ensemble neural network-based model utilizing multi-head attention for the identification of f5C. Five distinct feature extraction methods were employed to construct five individual artificial neural networks, and these networks were subsequently integrated through ensemble learning to create f5C-finder. 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests demonstrate that f5C-finder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with AUC of 0.807 and 0.827, respectively. The result highlights the effectiveness of biological language model in capturing both the order (sequential) and functional meaning (semantics) within genomes. Furthermore, the built-in interpretability allows us to understand what the model is learning, creating a bridge between identifying key sequential elements and a deeper exploration of their biological functions.</description>

      <title>Probing omics data via harmonic persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying molecular signatures from complex disease patients with underlying symptomatic similarities is a significant challenge in the analysis of high dimensional multi-omics data. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a way of extracting such information from the geometric structure of the data and identifying multiway higher-order relationships. Here, we propose an application of Harmonic persistent homology, which overcomes the limitations of ambiguous assignment of the topological information to the original elements in a representative topological cycle from the data. When applied to multi-omics data, this leads to the discovery of hidden patterns highlighting the relationships between different omic profiles, while allowing for common tasks in multi-omics analyses, such as disease subtyping, and most importantly biomarker identification for similar latent biological pathways that are associated with complex diseases. Our experiments on multiple cancer data show that harmonic persistent homology effectively dissects multi-omics data to identify biomarkers by detecting representative cycles predictive of disease subtypes.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous inference for generalized linear models with unmeasured confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</description>

      <title>GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this "diagnostic odyssey" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.</description>
