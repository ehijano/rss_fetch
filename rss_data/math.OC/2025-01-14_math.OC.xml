      <title>Linear Algebraic Truncation Algorithm with A Posteriori Error Bounds for Computing Markov Chain Equilibrium Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical computation of equilibrium reward gradients for Markov chains appears in many applications for example within the policy improvement step arising in connection with average reward stochastic dynamic programming. When the state space is large or infinite, one will typically need to truncate the state space in order to arrive at a numerically tractable formulation. In this paper, we derive the first computable a posteriori error bounds for equilibrium reward gradients that account for the error induced by the truncation. Our approach uses regeneration to express equilibrium quantities in terms of the expectations of cumulative rewards over regenerative cycles. Lyapunov functions are then used to bound the contributions to these cumulative rewards and their gradients from path excursions that take the chain outside the truncation set. Our numerical results indicate that our approach can provide highly accurate bounds with truncation sets of moderate size. We further extend our approach to Markov jump processes.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Randomization for Discrete-Time Linear Exponential Quadratic Gaussian (LEQG) Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exploratory randomization for an extended linear-exponential-quadratic-Gaussian (LEQG) control problem in discrete time. This extended control problem is related to the structure of risk-sensitive investment management applications. We introduce exploration through a randomization of the control. Next, we apply the duality between free energy and relative entropy to reduce the LEQG problem to an equivalent risk-neutral LQG control problem with an entropy regularization term, see, e.g. Dai Pra et al. (1996), for which we present a solution approach based on Dynamic Programming. Our approach, based on the energy-entropy duality may also be considered as leading to a justification for the use, in the literature, of an entropy regularization when applying a randomized control.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Infrastructure Networks with Multicriteria Portfolio Decision Analysis: An Application to Railway Stations in Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced societies are crucially dependent on critical infrastructure networks for the reliable delivery of essential goods and services. Hence, well-founded analyses concerning disruptions are needed to guide decisions that seek to ensure the performance of these networks in the face of failures caused by vulnerabilities to external hazards or technical malfunctions. In this setting, we develop a multicriteria decision analysis approach to support the formulation of cost-efficient portfolios of preventive reinforcement actions. Our approach is general in that it (i) allows for multiple objectives, such as those that represent the volume of traffic that is enabled between alternative origin-destination pairs in a transportation network, (ii) uses methods of probabilistic risk assessment to quantify the expected performance of the network, and (iii) solves optimization problems to identify those combinations of reinforcement actions that are cost-efficient in improving the performance of the network, given the available, possibly incomplete information about the relative importance of objectives. Our methodological contributions are illustrated by a case study on the analysis of railway switches at a representative Finnish railway station.</description>

      <title>SMOP: Stochastic trust region method for multi-objective problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem considered is a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the goal is to find an optimal value of a vector function representing various criteria. The aim of this work is to develop an algorithm which utilizes the trust region framework with probabilistic model functions, able to cope with noisy problems, using inaccurate functions and gradients. We prove the almost sure convergence of the proposed algorithm to a Pareto critical point if the model functions are good approximations in probabilistic sense. Numerical results demonstrate effectiveness of the probabilistic trust region by comparing it to competitive stochastic multi-objective solvers. The application in supervised machine learning is showcased by training non discriminatory Logistic Regression models on different size data groups. Additionally, we use several test examples with irregularly shaped fronts to exhibit the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Event Constrained Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present event constraints as a new modeling paradigm that generalizes joint chance constraints from stochastic optimization to (1) enforce a constraint on the probability of satisfying a set of constraints aggregated via application-specific logic (constituting an event) and (2) to be applied to general infinite-dimensional optimization (InfiniteOpt) problems (i.e., time, space, and/or uncertainty domains). This new constraint class offers significant modeling flexibility in posing InfiniteOpt constraints that are enforced over a certain portion of their domain (e.g., to a certain probability level), but can be challenging to reformulate/solve due to difficulties in representing arbitrary logical conditions and specifying a probabilistic measure on a collection of constraints. To address these challenges, we derive a generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) representation of event constrained optimization problems, which readily enables us to pose logical event conditions in a standard form and allows us to draw from a suite of GDP solution strategies that leverage the special structure of this problem class. We also extend several approximation techniques from the chance constraint literature to provide a means to reformulate certain event constraints without the use of binary variables. We illustrate these findings with case studies in stochastic optimal power flow, dynamic disease control, and optimal 2D diffusion.</description>

      <title>Two Proofs of a Structural Theorem of Decreasing Minimization on Integrally Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives two different proofs to a structural theorem of decreasing minimization (lexicographic optimization) on integrally convex sets. The theorem states that the set of decreasingly minimal elements of an integrally convex set can be represented as the intersection of a unit discrete cube and a face of the convex hull of the given integrally convex set. The first proof resorts to the Fenchel-type duality theorem in discrete convex analysis and the second is more elementary using Farkas' lemma.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Iterative algorithm for solving Variational Inclusion and Fixed point problems involving Multivalued Quasi-Nonexpansive and Demicontractive Operators in real Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modified general viscosity iterative process designed to solve variational inclusion and fixed point problems involving multi-valued quasi-nonexpansive and demi-contractive operators. The modified iterative process incorporates a viscosity approximation technique to handle the nonexpansive and contractive mappings, providing a more robust and efficient solution approach. By introducing an additional sequence of iterates, the algorithm iteratively approximates the desired solution by combining fixed point iteration with viscosity approximation. The proposed method has been proven to converge strongly to the solution of the given problem, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the results.</description>

      <title>A Linear Complexity Algorithm for Optimal Transport Problem with Log-type Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Q. Liao et al., Commun. Math. Sci., 20(2022)], a linear-time Sinkhorn algorithm is developed based on dynamic programming, which significantly reduces the computational complexity involved in solving optimal transport problems. However, this algorithm is specifically designed for the Wasserstein-1 metric. We are curious whether the preceding dynamic programming framework can be extended to tackle optimal transport problems with different transport costs. Notably, two special kinds of optimal transport problems, the Sinkhorn ranking and the far-field reflector and refractor problems, are closely associated with the log-type transport costs. Interestingly, by employing series rearrangement and dynamic programming techniques, it is feasible to perform the matrix-vector multiplication within the Sinkhorn iteration in linear time for this type of cost. This paper provides a detailed exposition of its implementation and applications, with numerical simulations demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence and Complexity of the Stochastic Central Finite-Difference Based Gradient Estimation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic framework for solving unconstrained stochastic optimization problems using only stochastic function evaluations. We employ central finite-difference based gradient estimation methods to approximate the gradients and dynamically control the accuracy of these approximations by adjusting the sample sizes used in stochastic realizations. We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed framework on nonconvex functions. Our analysis yields sublinear convergence results to the neighborhood of the solution, and establishes the optimal worst-case iteration complexity ($\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$) and sample complexity ($\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$) for each gradient estimation method to achieve an $\epsilon$-accurate solution. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework and the quality of the gradient estimation methods through numerical experiments on nonlinear least squares problems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Highly Robust Solutions in Multi-Objective Programming in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the challenging issues in uncertain multi-objective optimization, where uncertainty permeates nonsmooth nonconvex objective and constraint functions. In this context, we investigate highly robust (weakly efficient) solutions, a solution concept defined by efficiency across all scenarios. Our exploration reveals important relationships between highly robust solutions and other robustness notions, including set-based and worst-case notions, as well as connections with proper and isolated efficiency. Leveraging modern techniques from variational analysis, we establish necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for these solutions. Moreover, we explore the robustness of multi-objective optimization problems in the face of various uncertain sets, such as ball, ellipsoidal, and polyhedral sets.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control for the Oldroyd Equation in Memoriam to Professor Luiz Adauto Medeiros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript deals with a hierarchical control problem for Oldroyd equation under the Stackelberg-Nash strategy. The Oldroyd equation model is defined by non-regular coefficients, that is, they are bounded measurable functions. We assume that we can act in the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls, where one main control (the leader) and several additional secondary control (the followers) act in order to accomplish their given tasks: controllability for the leader and optimization for followers. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and its characterization, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for leader control.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the approximate controllability for a one-dimensional wave equation in domains with moving boundary. This equation models the motion of a string where an endpoint is fixed and the other one is moving. When the speed of the moving endpoint is less than the characteristic speed, the controllability of this equation is established. We present the following results: the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for the leader control.</description>

      <title>Initial Guess Generation for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design with Robustness to Missed-Thrust-Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in cislunar space exploration in recent years has driven an increasing demand for efficient low-thrust missions to key cislunar orbits. These missions, typically possessing long thrust arcs, are particularly susceptible to operational uncertainties such as missed thrust events. Addressing these challenges requires efficient robust trajectory design frameworks during the preliminary mission design phase, where it is necessary to explore the solution space at a rapid cadence under evolving operational constraints. However, existing methods for missed thrust design rely on solving high-dimensional nonlinear programs, where generating effective initial guesses becomes challenging. To enhance computational efficiency, quality, and depth of robustness of solutions from global search, we compare two initial guess strategies: a baseline non-conditional global search, which samples from a static distribution with global support, and a conditional global search, which generates initial guesses conditioned on solutions to problems with less depth of robustness. The conditional search provides a sequential procedure for solving increasingly robust problems. We validate the improvements in the conditional approach using a low-thrust case study for the Lunar Gateway Power and Propulsion Element, where our results demonstrate that it significantly improves convergence rate and solution quality, highlighting its potential in preliminary robust trajectory design.</description>

      <title>A Smoothing Consensus-Based Optimization Algorithm for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lately, a novel swarm intelligence model, namely the consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm, was introduced to deal with the global optimization problems. Limited by the conditions of Ito's formula, the convergence analysis of the previous CBO finite particle system mainly focuses on the problem with smooth objective function. With the help of smoothing method, this paper achieves a breakthrough by proposing an effective CBO algorithm for solving the global solution of a nonconvex, nonsmooth, and possible non-Lipschitz continuous minimization problem with theoretical analysis, which dose not rely on the mean-field limit. We indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits a global consensus and converges to a common state with any initial data. Then, we give a more detailed error estimation on the objective function values along the state of the proposed algorithm towards the global minimum. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the appreciable performance of the proposed method on solving the nonsmooth, nonconvex minimization problems.</description>

      <title>Discrete lossless convexification for pointing constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Lossless Convexification (DLCvx) formulates a convex relaxation for a specific class of discrete-time non-convex optimal control problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which the solution of the relaxed problem satisfies the original non-convex constraints at specified time grid points. Furthermore, it provides an upper bound on the number of time grid points where these sufficient conditions may not hold, and thus the original constraints could be violated. This paper extends DLCvx to problems with control pointing constraints. Additionally, it introduces a novel DLCvx formulation for mixed-integer optimal control problems in which the control is either inactive or constrained within an annular sector. This formulation broadens the feasible space for problems with pointing constraints. A numerical example is provided to illustrate its application.</description>

      <title>An Alternating Approach to Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to solve large-scale Markov decision programming (MDP) problem. In comparison with many classic ADP methods which have large number of constraints, we formulate an alternating ADP (AADP) which have both small number of constraints and small number of variables by approximating the decision variables (instead of the objective functions in classic ADP) and write the dual of the exact LP. Also, to get the basis functions, we use kernel approximation instead of empirical choice of basis functions, which can efficiently learn nonlinear functions while retaining the expressive power. By treating option pricing as an large-scale MDP problem, we apply the AADP method to give an empirical proof that American call option will not be exercised earlier if the underlying stock has no dividend payment, which is a classic result proved by Black-Scholes model. We also make comparison of pricing options in high-dimensional with some benchmark option pricing papers which use the classic ADP to give upper and lower bound of the option price.</description>

      <title>PDLP: A Practical First-Order Method for Large-Scale Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PDLP, a practical first-order method for linear programming (LP) designed to solve large-scale LP problems. PDLP is based on the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method applied to the minimax formulation of LP. PDLP incorporates several enhancements to PDHG, including diagonal preconditioning, presolving, adaptive step sizes, adaptive restarting, and feasibility polishing. Our algorithm is implemented in C++, available in Google's open-source OR-Tools library, and supports multithreading.
  To evaluate our method, we introduce a new collection of eleven large-scale LP problems with sizes ranging from 125 million to 6.3 billion nonzeros. PDLP solves eight of these instances to optimality gaps of 1\% (with primal and dual feasibility errors of less than $10^{-8}$) within six days on a single machine. We also compare PDLP with Gurobi barrier, primal simplex, and dual simplex implementations. Gurobi barrier solves only three instances, exceeding our 1TB RAM limit on the other eight. While primal and dual simplex are more memory-efficient than the barrier method, they are slower and solve only three instances within six days.
  Compared with the conference version of this work (in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (NeurIPS 2021)), the key new contributions are: (i) feasibility polishing, a technique that quickly finds solutions that are approximately optimal but almost exactly feasible (without which only three of the eleven problems can be solved); (ii) a multithreaded C++ implementation available in Google OR-Tools; and (iii) a new collection of large-scale LP problems. Note that the conference version should be referred to for comparisons with SCS and ablation studies, which we do not repeat in this paper.</description>

      <title>A New Concept of optimal control for epidemic spreading by Vaccination Technique for Assessing social optimum employing Pontryagins Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces a new approach utilizing optimal control theory (OCT) to assess the Social Optimum (SO) of a vaccination game, navigating the intricate considerations of cost, availability, and distribution policies. By integrating an SIRS/V epidemic model with a behavior model, the study analyzes individual vaccination strategies. A unique optimal control framework, centered on vaccination costs, is proposed, diverging significantly from previous methods. Our findings confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach in managing vaccination strategies. Moreover, we examine the underlying social dilemma of the vaccination game, investigating key parameters. By calculating the Nash equilibrium (NE) through the behavior model and determining the SO using our approach, we measure the Social Efficiency Deficit (SED), quantifying the overall cost gap between the NE and SO. Results indicate that an increased waning immunity rate exacerbates the social dilemma, although higher vaccination costs partially mitigate it. This research provides valuable insights into optimizing vaccination strategies amidst complex societal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimization with Multi-sourced Reference Information and Unknown Trust: A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In problems that involve input parameter information gathered from multiple data sources with varying reliability, incorporating users' trust about different sources in decision-optimization models can potentially improve solution performance and reliability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-reference distributionally robust optimization (MR-DRO) framework, where the model inputs are uncertain and their probability distributions can be statistically inferred from multiple data sources. Via nonparametric data fusion, we construct a Wasserstein ambiguity set to minimize the worst-case expected value of a stochastic objective function, accounting for both uncertainty and unknown reliability of information sources. We reformulate the MR-DRO model as a linear program given linear objective and constraints in the original problem. We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that adjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In addition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources with dominant trust. Via solving instances of resource allocation and portfolio optimization, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust-informed MR-DRO approach compared to traditional optimization frameworks relying on a single data source. Our results highlight the significance of integrating (dynamic) user trust in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when given diverse and potentially conflicting input data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Methods for Multiobjective Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a multiobjective version of the unit commitment problem that deals with finding the optimal generation schedule of a firm, over a period of time and a given electrical network. With growing importance of environmental impact, some objectives of interest include CO2 emission levels and renewable energy penetration, in addition to the standard generation costs. Some typical constraints include limits on generation levels and up/down times on generation units. This further entails solving a multiobjective mixed integer optimization problem. The related literature has predominantly focused on heuristics (like Genetic Algorithms) for solving larger problem instances. Our major intent in this work is to propose scalable versions of mathematical optimization based approaches that help in speeding up the process of estimating the underlying Pareto frontier. Our contributions are computational and rest on two key embodiments. First, we use the notion of both epsilon constraints and adaptive weights to solve a sequence of single objective optimization problems. Second, to ease the computational burden, we propose a Mccormick-type relaxation for quadratic type constraints that arise due to the resulting formulation types. We test the proposed computational framework on real network data from [1,50] and compare the same with standard solvers like Gurobi. Results show a significant reduction in complexity (computational time) when deploying the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>State-space reduction techniques exploiting specific constraints for quantum search Application to a specific job scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum search has emerged as one of the most promising fields in quantum computing. State-of-the-art quantum search algorithms enable the search for specific elements in a distribution by monotonically increasing the density of these elements until reaching a high density. This kind of algorithms demonstrate a theoretical quadratic speed-up on the number of queries compared to classical search algorithms in unstructured spaces. Unfortunately, the major part of the existing literature applies quantum search to problems which size grows exponnentialy with the input size without exploiting any specific problem structure, rendering this kind of approach not exploitable in real industrial problems. In contrast, this work proposes exploiting specific constraints of scheduling problems to build an initial superposition of states with size almost quadraticaly increasing as a function of the problem size. This state space reduction, inspired by the quantum walk algorithm, constructs a state superposition corresponding to all paths in a state-graph embedding spacing constraints between jobs. Our numerical results on quantum emulators highlights the potential of state space reduction approach, which could lead to more efficient quantum search processes by focusing on a smaller, more relevant, solution space.</description>

      <title>Integrated Wind Farm Design: Optimizing Turbine Placement and Cable Routing with Wake Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources is crucial for a successful transformation of the current energy system, with wind energy playing a key role in this transition. This study addresses the integrated wind farm layout and cable routing problem, a challenging nonlinear optimization problem. We model this problem as an extended version of the Quota Steiner Tree Problem (QSTP), optimizing turbine placement and network connectivity simultaneously to meet specified expansion targets. Our proposed approach accounts for the wake effect - a region of reduced wind speed induced by each installed turbine - and enforces minimum spacing between turbines. We introduce an exact solution framework in terms of the novel Quota Steiner Tree Problem with interference (QSTPI). By leveraging an interference-based splitting strategy, we develop an advanced solver capable of tackling large-scale problem instances. The presented approach outperforms generic state-of-the-art mixed integer programming solvers on our dataset by up to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we demonstrate that our integrated method significantly reduces the costs in contrast to a sequential approach. Thus, we provide a planning tool that enhances existing planning methodologies for supporting a faster and cost-efficient expansion of wind energy.</description>

Abstract: We establish partial H\"older continuity of the gradient for equilibrium configurations of vectorial multidimensional variational problems, involving bulk and surface energies. The bulk energy densities are uniformly strictly quasiconvex functions with $p$-growth, $1&lt;p&lt; 2$, without any further structure conditions. The anisotropic surface energy is defined by means of an elliptic integrand $\Phi$ not necessarily regular.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of the Scholtes regularization for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC), we refine the convergence analysis of the Scholtes regularization. Our goal is to relate nondegenerate C-stationary points of MPCC with nondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of its Scholtes regularization. We detected the following anomalies: (i) in a neighborhood of a nondegenerate C-stationary point there could be degenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization; (ii) even if nondegenerate, they might be locally non-unique; (iii) if nevertheless unique, their quadratic index potentially differs from the C-index of the C-stationary point under consideration. Thus, a change of the topological type for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization is possible. In particular, a nondegenerate minimizer of MPCC might be approximated by saddle points. In order to bypass the mentioned anomalies, an additional generic condition for nondegenerate C-stationary points of MPCC is identified. Then, we uniquely trace nondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization and successively maintain their topological type.</description>

      <title>Smoothing Iterative Consensus-based Optimization Algorithm for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization Problems with Global Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on finding the global minimizer of a general unconstrained nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem. Taking advantage of the smoothing method and the consensus-based optimization (CBO) method, we propose a novel smoothing iterative consensus-based optimization (SICBO) algorithm. First, we prove that the solution process of the proposed algorithm here exponentially converges to a common stochastic consensus point almost surely. Second, we establish a detailed theoretical analysis to ensure the small enough error between the objective function value at the consensus point and the optimal function value, to the best of our knowledge, which provides the first theoretical guarantee to the global optimality of the proposed algorithm for nonconvex optimization problems. Moreover, unlike the previously introduced CBO methods, the theoretical results are valid for the cases that the objective function is nonsmooth, nonconvex and perhaps non-Lipschitz continuous. Finally, several numerical examples are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for solving the global minimizer of the nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Method for Simultaneous Design and Control Optimization of Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a carbon-neutral energy system requires massive installation of renewable energy sources and economically feasible energy storage solutions. This study addresses these challenges by optimizing the design and control strategies of an energy system that meets the heat and electricity demands of a community. The proposed system integrates solar and wind power with energy storage, including seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) and battery, coupled via a heat pump. This approach enhances self-sufficiency and effectively mitigates seasonal mismatches. To model heat transfer between the storage and the ground in the STES system, we employ a multi-node lumped-parameter method. The optimization problem is formulated as a periodic optimal control problem, which is then transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem. To reduce computational complexity, we apply the averaging method, which significantly lowers the effort required to solve the problem. We apply this approach to a case study, where the economically optimized configuration results in a projected total energy cost per household of approximately 75 EUR/month over 30 years for both heat and electricity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of designing economically viable, autonomous energy communities in real-world scenarios, and provides a comprehensive optimization framework for designing system components and control strategies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients and address the class of running algorithms where only one iteration per time change is performed. We model these algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with a time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce terms that can be interpreted as a temporal rate of change in the cost function and the optimal value. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has established itself as a robust framework for quantifying differences between distributions, with applications that span fields such as machine learning, data science, and computer vision. This paper offers a detailed examination of the OT problem, beginning with its theoretical foundations, including the classical formulations of Monge and Kantorovich and their extensions to modern computational techniques. It explores cutting-edge algorithms, including Sinkhorn iterations, primal-dual strategies, and reduction-based approaches, emphasizing their efficiency and scalability in addressing high-dimensional problems. The paper also highlights emerging trends, such as integrating OT into machine learning frameworks, the development of novel problem variants, and ongoing theoretical advancements. Applications of OT are presented across a range of domains, with particular attention to its innovative application in time series data analysis via Optimal Transport Warping (OTW), a robust alternative to methods like Dynamic Time Warping. Despite the significant progress made, challenges related to scalability, robustness, and ethical considerations remain, necessitating further research. The paper underscores OT's potential to bridge theoretical depth and practical utility, fostering impactful advancements across diverse disciplines.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Strategies to Embed Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Formulations Solved via Direct Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to benchmark candidate strategies for embedding neural network (NN) surrogates in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulations that are subject to systems described with partial differential equations and that are solved via direct transcription (i.e., simultaneous methods). This study focuses on the use of physics-informed NNs and physics-informed convolutional NNs as the internal (surrogate) models within the NMPC formulation. One strategy embeds NN models as explicit algebraic constraints, leveraging the automatic differentiation (AD) of an algebraic modelling language (AML) to evaluate the derivatives. Alternatively, the solver can be provided with derivatives computed external to the AML via the AD routines of the machine learning environment the NN is trained in. The three numerical experiments considered in this work reveal that replacing mechanistic models with NN surrogates may not always offer computational advantages when smooth activation functions are used in conjunction with a local nonlinear solver (e.g., Ipopt), even with highly nonlinear systems. Moreover, in this context, the external function evaluation of the NN surrogates often outperforms the embedding strategies that rely on explicit algebraic constraints, likely due to the difficulty in initializing the auxiliary variables and constraints introduced by explicit algebraic reformulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (2024) Camacho, C\'{a}novas, Mart\'{\i}nez-Legaz and Parra introduced bimonotone operators, i.e., operators $T$ such that both $T$ and $-T$ are monotone, and found some interesting applications to convex feasibility problems, especially in the case the operator is also paramonotone. In the present paper we drop paramonotonicity and examine the question of finding the most general form of a bimonotone operator in a Banach space. We show that any such operator can be reduced in some sense to a single-valued, skew symmetric linear operator. This facilitates the proof of some results involving these operators in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for statistical inference on Riemannian manifolds that achieves high-order accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by non-Euclidean parameter spaces frequently encountered in modern data science. Our approach leverages a novel and computationally efficient procedure to reach higher-order asymptotic precision. In particular, we develop a bootstrap algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that is both computationally efficient and accurate for hypothesis testing and confidence region construction. Although locational hypothesis testing can be reformulated as a standard Euclidean problem, constructing high-order accurate confidence regions necessitates careful treatment of manifold geometry. To this end, we establish high-order asymptotics under a fixed normal chart centered at the true parameter, thereby enabling precise expansions that incorporate curvature effects. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework across various manifold settings-including spheres, the Stiefel manifold, fixed-rank matrices manifolds, and rank-one tensor manifolds-and, for Euclidean submanifolds, introduce a class of projection-like coordinate charts with strong consistency properties. Finally, numerical studies confirm the practical merits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>How Low Can We Go? Minimizing Interaction Samples for Configurable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software systems are typically configurable, a fundamental prerequisite for wide applicability and reusability. This flexibility poses an extraordinary challenge for quality assurance, as the enormous number of possible configurations makes it impractical to test each of them separately. This is where t-wise interaction sampling can be used to systematically cover the configuration space and detect unknown feature interactions. Over the last two decades, numerous algorithms for computing small interaction samples have been studied, providing improvements for a range of heuristic results; nevertheless, it has remained unclear how much these results can still be improved.
  We present a significant breakthrough: a fundamental framework, based on the mathematical principle of duality, for combining near-optimal solutions with provable lower bounds on the required sample size. This implies that we no longer need to work on heuristics with marginal or no improvement, but can certify the solution quality by establishing a limit on the remaining gap; in many cases, we can even prove optimality of achieved solutions. This theoretical contribution also provides extensive practical improvements: Our algorithm SampLNS was tested on 47 small and medium-sized configurable systems from the existing literature. SampLNS can reliably find samples of smaller size than previous methods in 85% of the cases; moreover, we can achieve and prove optimality of solutions for 63% of all instances. This makes it possible to avoid cumbersome efforts of minimizing samples by researchers as well as practitioners, and substantially save testing resources for most configurable systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Bookmaking for Binary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online betting, the bookmaker can update the payoffs it offers on a particular event many times before the event takes place, and the updated payoffs may depend on the bets accumulated thus far. We study the problem of bookmaking with the goal of maximizing the return in the worst-case, with respect to the gamblers' behavior and the event's outcome. We formalize this problem as the \emph{Optimal Online Bookmaking game}, and provide the exact solution for the binary case. To this end, we develop the optimal bookmaking strategy, which relies on a new technique called bi-balancing trees, that assures that the house loss is the same for all \emph{decisive} betting sequences, where the gambler bets all its money on a single outcome in each round.</description>

      <title>Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</description>

      <title>Generating Poisoning Attacks against Ridge Regression Models with Categorical Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models have become a very powerful tool to extract information from large datasets and use it to make accurate predictions and automated decisions. However, ML models can be vulnerable to external attacks, causing them to underperform or deviate from their expected tasks. One way to attack ML models is by injecting malicious data to mislead the algorithm during the training phase, which is referred to as a poisoning attack. We can prepare for such situations by designing anticipated attacks, which are later used for creating and testing defence strategies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to generate strong poisoning attacks for a ridge regression model containing both numerical and categorical features that explicitly models and poisons categorical features. We model categorical features as SOS-1 sets and formulate the problem of designing poisoning attacks as a bilevel optimization problem that is nonconvex mixed-integer in the upper-level and unconstrained convex quadratic in the lower-level. We present the mathematical formulation of the problem, introduce a single-level reformulation based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the lower level, find bounds for the lower-level variables to accelerate solver performance, and propose a new algorithm to poison categorical features. Numerical experiments show that our method improves the mean squared error of all datasets compared to the previous benchmark in the literature.</description>

      <title>Variable Bregman Majorization-Minimization Algorithm and its Application to Dirichlet Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Bregman descent algorithm for minimizing a convex function that is expressed as the sum of a differentiable part (defined over an open set) and a possibly nonsmooth term. The approach, referred to as the Variable Bregman Majorization-Minimization (VBMM) algorithm, extends the Bregman Proximal Gradient method by allowing the Bregman function used in the divergence to adaptively vary at each iteration, provided it satisfies a majorizing condition on the objective function. This adaptive framework enables the algorithm to approximate the objective more precisely at each iteration, thereby allowing for accelerated convergence compared to the traditional Bregman Proximal Gradient descent. We establish the convergence of the VBMM algorithm to a minimizer under mild assumptions on the family of metrics used. Furthermore, we introduce a novel application of both the Bregman Proximal Gradient method and the VBMM algorithm to the estimation of the multidimensional parameters of a Dirichlet distribution through the maximization of its log-likelihood. Numerical experiments confirm that the VBMM algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Derivation of effective gradient flow equations and dynamical truncation of training data in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit equations governing the cumulative biases and weights in Deep Learning with ReLU activation function, based on gradient descent for the Euclidean cost in the input layer, and under the assumption that the weights are, in a precise sense, adapted to the coordinate system distinguished by the activations. We show that gradient descent corresponds to a dynamical process in the input layer, whereby clusters of data are progressively reduced in complexity ("truncated") at an exponential rate that increases with the number of data points that have already been truncated. We provide a detailed discussion of several types of solutions to the gradient flow equations. A main motivation for this work is to shed light on the interpretability question in supervised learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt{\'a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>An Error Analysis of Second Order Elliptic Optimal Control Problem via Hybrid Higher Order Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and analysis of a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) approximation for a distributed optimal control problem governed by the Poisson equation. We propose three distinct schemes to address unconstrained control problems and two schemes for constrained control problems. For the unconstrained control problem, while standard finite elements achieve a convergence rate of \( k+1 \) (with \( k \) representing the polynomial degree), our approach enhances this rate to \( k+2 \) by selecting the control from a carefully constructed reconstruction space. For the box-constrained problem, we demonstrate that using lowest-order elements (\( \mathbb{P}_0 \)) yields linear convergence, in contrast to finite element methods (FEM) that require linear elements to achieve comparable results. Furthermore, we derive a cubic convergence rate for control in the variational discretization scheme. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13111v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a distributionally robust optimization formulation (i.e., a min-max game) for two representative problems in Bayesian nonparametric estimation: Gaussian process regression and, more generally, linear inverse problems. Our formulation seeks the best mean-squared error predictor, in an infinite-dimensional space, against an adversary who chooses the worst-case model in a Wasserstein ball around a nominal infinite-dimensional Bayesian model. The transport cost is chosen to control features such as the degree of roughness of the sample paths that the adversary is allowed to inject. We show that the game has a well-defined value (i.e., strong duality holds in the sense that max-min equals min-max) and that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium which can be computed by a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations. Crucially, the worst-case distribution is itself Gaussian. We explore properties of the Nash equilibrium and the effects of hyperparameters through a set of numerical experiments, demonstrating the versatility of our modeling framework.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Decentralized Smooth Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13931v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decentralized optimization problem $\min_{{\bf x}\in{\mathbb R}^d} f({\bf x})\triangleq \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i({\bf x})$, where the local function on the $i$-th agent has the form of $f_i({\bf x})\triangleq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n f_{i,j}({\bf x})$ and every individual $f_{i,j}$ is smooth but possibly nonconvex. We propose a stochastic algorithm called DEcentralized probAbilistic Recursive gradiEnt deScenT (DEAREST) method, which achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point at each agent with the communication rounds of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(L\epsilon^{-2}/\sqrt{\gamma}\,)$, the computation rounds of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n+(L+\min\{nL, \sqrt{n/m}\bar L\})\epsilon^{-2})$, and the local incremental first-oracle calls of ${\mathcal O}(mn + {\min\{mnL, \sqrt{mn}\bar L\}}{\epsilon^{-2}})$, where $L$ is the smoothness parameter of the objective function, $\bar L$ is the mean-squared smoothness parameter of all individual functions, and $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the mixing matrix associated with the network. We then establish the lower bounds to show that the proposed method is near-optimal. Notice that the smoothness parameters $L$ and $\bar L$ used in our algorithm design and analysis are global, leading to sharper complexity bounds than existing results that depend on the local smoothness. We further extend DEAREST to solve the decentralized finite-sum optimization problem under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, also achieving the near-optimal complexity bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a descent method for nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problems on complete Riemannian manifolds is proposed. The objective functions are only assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous instead of convexity used in existing methods. A necessary condition for Pareto optimality in Euclidean space is generalized to the Riemannian setting. At every iteration, an acceptable descent direction is obtained by constructing a convex hull of some Riemannian $\varepsilon$-subgradients. And then a Riemannian Armijo-type line search is executed to produce the next iterate. The convergence result is established in the sense that a point satisfying the necessary condition for Pareto optimality can be generated by the algorithm in a finite number of iterations. Finally, some preliminary numerical results are reported, which show that the proposed method is efficient.</description>

      <title>Accelerating genetic optimization of nonlinear model predictive control by learning optimal search space size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) is typically used to solve nonlinear model predictive control's optimization problem. However, the size of the search space in which the GA searches for the optimal control inputs is crucial for its applicability to fast-response systems. This paper proposes accelerating the genetic optimization of NMPC by learning optimal search space size. The approach trains a multivariate regression model to adaptively predict the best smallest size of the search space in every control cycle. The proposed approach reduces the GA's computational time, improves the chance of convergence to better control inputs, and provides a stable and feasible solution. The proposed approach was evaluated on three nonlinear systems and compared to four other evolutionary algorithms implemented in a processor-in-the-loop fashion. The results show that the proposed approach provides a 17-45\% reduction in computational time and increases the convergence rate by 35-47\%. The source code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the value of the objective function and the Hessian spectrum. The results allow an analytic characterization of various obstructions to using local optimization methods, revealing in particular a complex array of saddles and minima differing by their symmetry, structure and analytic properties. A~desirable phenomenon, occurring for all critical points considered, concerns the number of negative Hessian eigenvalues increasing with the value of the objective function. Our approach makes use of Newton polyhedra as well as results from real algebraic geometry, notably the Curve Selection Lemma, to determine the extremal character of degenerate critical points, establishing in particular the existence of infinite families of third-order saddles which can significantly slow down the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Anytime Solvers for Variational Inequalities: the (Recursive) Safe Monotone Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes anytime algorithms, in the form of continuous-time dynamical systems, to solve monotone variational inequalities. We introduce three algorithms that solve this problem: the projected monotone flow, the safe monotone flow, and the recursive safe monotone flow. The first two systems admit dual interpretations: either as projected dynamical systems or as dynamical systems controlled with a feedback controller synthesized using techniques from safety-critical control. The third flow bypasses the need to solve quadratic programs along the trajectories by incorporating a dynamics whose equilibria precisely correspond to such solutions, and interconnecting the dynamical systems on different time scales. We perform a thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of all three systems. For the safe monotone flow, we show that equilibria correspond exactly with critical points of the original problem, and the constraint set is forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The additional assumption of convexity and monotonicity allows us to derive global stability guarantees, as well as establish the system is contracting when the constraint set is polyhedral. For the recursive safe monotone flow, we use tools from singular perturbation theory for contracting systems to show KKT points are locally exponentially stable and globally attracting, and obtain practical safety guarantees. We illustrate the performance of the flows on a two-player game example and also demonstrate the versatility for interconnection and regulation of dynamical processes of the safe monotone flow in an example of a receding horizon linear quadratic dynamic game.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Lyapunov Functions: PDE Characterization, Learning, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic investigation of using physics-informed neural networks to compute Lyapunov functions. We encode Lyapunov conditions as a partial differential equation (PDE) and use this for training neural network Lyapunov functions. We analyze the analytical properties of the solutions to the Lyapunov and Zubov PDEs. In particular, we show that employing the Zubov equation in training neural Lyapunov functions can lead to approximate regions of attraction close to the true domain of attraction. We also examine approximation errors and the convergence of neural approximations to the unique solution of Zubov's equation. We then provide sufficient conditions for the learned neural Lyapunov functions that can be readily verified by satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, enabling formal verification of both local stability analysis and region-of-attraction estimates in the large. Through a number of nonlinear examples, ranging from low to high dimensions, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform traditional sums-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov functions obtained using semidefinite programming (SDP).</description>

      <title>Deck of Cards method for Hierarchical, Robust and Stochastic Ordinal Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the recently introduced application of the Deck of Cards Method (DCM) to ordinal regression proposing two extensions related to two main research trends in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding, namely scaling and ordinal regression generalizations. On the one hand, procedures, different from DCM (e.g. AHP, BWM, MACBETH) to collect and elaborate Decision Maker's (DM's) preference information are considered to define an overall evaluation of reference alternatives. On the other hand, Robust Ordinal Regression and Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis are used to offer the DM more detailed and realistic decision-support outcomes. More precisely, we take into account preference imprecision and indetermination through a set of admissible comprehensive evaluations of alternatives provided by the whole set of value functions compatible with DM's preference information rather than the univocal assessment obtained from a single value function. In addition, we also consider alternatives evaluated on a set of criteria hierarchically structured. The methodology we propose allows the DM to provide precise or imprecise information at different levels of the hierarchy of criteria. Like scaling procedures, the compatible value function we consider can be of a different nature, such as weighted sum, linear or general monotone value function, or Choquet integral. Consequently, the approach we propose is versatile and well-equipped to be adapted to DM's characteristics and requirements. The applicability of the proposed methodology is shown by a didactic example based on a large ongoing research project in which Italian regions are evaluated on criteria representing Circular Economy, Innovation-Driven Development and Smart Specialization Strategies.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Nonsmooth Composite Optimization under Orthogonality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of structured, nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems under orthogonality constraints, where the objectives combine a smooth function, a nonsmooth concave function, and a nonsmooth weakly convex function. This class of problems finds diverse applications in statistical learning and data science. Existing methods for addressing these problems often fail to exploit the specific structure of orthogonality constraints, struggle with nonsmooth functions, or result in suboptimal oracle complexity. We propose {\sf OADMM}, an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) designed to solve this class of problems using efficient proximal linearized strategies. Two specific variants of {\sf OADMM} are explored: one based on Euclidean Projection ({\sf OADMM-EP}) and the other on Riemannian Retraction ({\sf OADMM-RR}). Under mild assumptions, we prove that {\sf OADMM} converges to a critical point of the problem with an ergodic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Additionally, we establish a polynomial convergence rate or super-exponential convergence rate for {\sf OADMM}, depending on the specific setting, under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is \textit{the first non-ergodic convergence result} for this class of nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches Free From Lipschitz Constant Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Extract Interpretable Rules from Tree Ensembles via Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree ensembles are very popular machine learning models, known for their effectiveness in supervised classification and regression tasks. Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble models do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed method works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and its flexible formulation can include any arbitrary loss or regularization functions. Our extensive computational experiments offer statistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other rule extraction methods in terms of predictive performance and fidelity towards the tree ensemble. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed method effectively extracts interpretable rules from tree ensemble that are designed for time series data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in a Hilbertian setting, first and second-order monotone inclusions related to stochastic optimization problems with decision dependent distributions. The studied dynamics are formulated as monotone inclusions governed by Lipschitz perturbations of maximally monotone operators where the concept of equilibrium plays a central role. We discuss the relationship between the $\mathbb{W}_1$-Wasserstein Lipschitz behavior of the distribution and the so-called coarse Ricci curvature. As an application, we consider the monotone inclusions associated with stochastic optimisation problems involving the sum of a smooth function with Lipschitz gradient, a proximable function and a composite term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06204v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops an algorithm for distributed computing of linear programming problems of huge-scales. Global consensus with single common variable, multiblocks, and augmented Lagrangian are adopted. The consensus is used to partition the constraints of equality and inequality into multi-consensus blocks, and the subblocks of each consensus block are employed to partition the primal variables into $M$ sets of disjoint subvectors. The block-coordinate Gauss-Seidel method, the proximal point method, and ADMM are used to update the primal variables, and descent models used to update the dual. Under the dual sequences supposedly bounded, convergence of the algorithm to optimal solution is shown and the rate of convergence of the augmented Lagrangian, of $O(1/k)$ is obtained. It is yet to be investigated regarding the issue of the dual sequences to be bounded via initialization of the primal and dual sequences and the control parameter values.</description>

Abstract: Matrix regression plays an important role in modern data analysis due to its ability to handle complex relationships involving both matrix and vector variables. We propose a class of regularized regression models capable of predicting both matrix and vector variables, accommodating various regularization techniques tailored to the inherent structures of the data. We establish the consistency of our estimator when penalizing the nuclear norm of the matrix variable and the $\ell_1$ norm of the vector variable. To tackle the general regularized regression model, we propose a unified framework based on an efficient preconditioned proximal point algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior estimation and prediction accuracy of our proposed estimator, as well as the efficiency of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Bird migration is an adaptive behavior ultimately aiming at optimizing survival and reproductive success. We propose an optimal switching model to study bird migration, where birds' migration behaviors can be efficiently modeled as switching between different stochastic differential equations. For individuals with perfect information regarding the environment, we implement numeric methods to see the expected payoff and corresponding optimal control. For individual with only partial information of the environment, we combine the finite difference method and stochastic simulations to investigate the change of the bird's optimal strategy. Based on biological backgrounds, we characterizing the optimal strategies of birds under different scenarios and these behaviors depend on the specific assumptions of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework for Merton's portfolio problem, unifying modern neural-network-based policy parameterization with the adjoint viewpoint from Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP). Instead of approximating the value function (as done in deep BSDE methods), we track a policy-fixed BSDE for the adjoint processes, which allows each gradient update to align with continuous-time PMP conditions. This setup yields locally optimal consumption and investment policies that are closely tied to classical stochastic control. We further incorporate an alignment penalty that nudges the learned policy toward Pontryagin-derived solutions, enhancing both convergence speed and training stability. Numerical experiments confirm that PG-DPO effectively handles both consumption and investment, achieving strong performance and interpretability without requiring large offline datasets or model-free reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: We study non-convex delayed-noise online optimization problems by evaluating dynamic regret in the non-stationary setting when the loss functions are quasar-convex. In particular, we consider scenarios involving quasar-convex functions either with a Lipschitz gradient or weakly smooth and, for each case, we ensure bounded dynamic regret in terms of cumulative path variation achieving sub-linear regret rates. Furthermore, we illustrate the flexibility of our framework by applying it to both theoretical settings such as zeroth-order (bandit) and also to practical applications with quadratic fractional functions. Moreover, we provide new examples of non-convex functions that are quasar-convex by proving that the class of differentiable strongly quasiconvex functions (Polyak 1966) are strongly quasar-convex on convex compact sets. Finally, several numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings, illustrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

Subsequently, by applying the Schauder fixed-point theorem (SFPT), we prove the existence of a solution and demonstrate the finite-approximate controllability of semilinear impulsive systems in Hilbert spaces. Finally, we extend these results to a broader application, specifically to the heat equation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient Tracking Algorithms for Distributed Optimization Problems with Inexact Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed optimization problems usually face inexact communication issues induced by communication quantization, differential privacy protection, or channels noise. Most existing algorithms need two-timescale setting of the stepsize of gradient descent and the parameter of noise suppression to ensure the convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose two single-timescale algorithms, VRA-DGT and VRA--DSGT, for distributed deterministic and stochastic optimization problems with inexact communication respectively. VRA-DGT integrates the Variance-Reduced Aggregation (VRA) mechanism with the distributed gradient tracking framework, which achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-1}\right)$ in the mean-square sense when the objective function is strongly convex and smooth. For distributed stochastic optimization problem,VRA-DSGT, where a hybrid variance reduction technique has been introduced in VRA-DGT,
  VRA-DGT,, maintains the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-1}\right)$ for strongly convex and smooth objective function. Simulated experiments on logistic regression problem with real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study neural networks' loss surfaces by methods of topological data analysis. We suggest to apply barcodes of Morse complexes to explore topology of loss surfaces. An algorithm for calculations of the loss function's barcodes of local minima is described. We have conducted experiments for calculating barcodes of local minima for benchmark functions and for loss surfaces of small neural networks. Our experiments confirm our two principal observations for neural networks' loss surfaces. First, the barcodes of local minima are located in a small lower part of the range of values of neural networks' loss function. Secondly, increase of the neural network's depth and width lowers the barcodes of local minima. This has some natural implications for the neural network's learning and for its generalization properties.</description>

Abstract: We obtain, under an additional assumption on the subanalytic abnormal distribution constructed in [4], a proof of the minimal rank Sard conjecture in the analytic category. It establishes that from a given point the set of points accessible through singular horizontal curves of minimal rank, which corresponds to the rank of the distribution, has Lebesgue measure zero. The minimal rank Sard Conjecture is equivalent to the Sard Conjecture for co-rank 1 distributions.</description>

      <title>The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit conjugate points on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family contains the well-known canonical and Euclidean metrics. An upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold in the considered metric is then obtained as the minimum between the length of the geodesic along which the points are conjugate and the length of certain geodesic loops. Numerical experiments support the conjecture that the obtained upper bound is in fact equal to the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Game of Market Entry: Portfolio Liquidation with Trading Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider both $N$-player and mean-field games of optimal portfolio liquidation in which the players are not allowed to change the direction of trading. Players with an initially short position of stocks are only allowed to buy while players with an initially long position are only allowed to sell the stock. Under suitable conditions on the model parameters we show that the games are equivalent to games of timing where the players need to determine the optimal times of market entry and exit. We identify the equilibrium entry and exit times and prove that equilibrium mean-trading rates can be characterized in terms of the solutions to a highly non-linear higher-order integral equation with endogenous terminal condition. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the integral equation from which we obtain the existence of a unique equilibrium both in the mean-field and the $N$-player game.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose a method for the inference of parameters of stochastic reaction networks that works for both steady-state and time-resolved data and is applicable to networks with non-linear and rational propensities. Our approach provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices by taking observations to form moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common non-linear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model and the toggle switch, a model of post-transcriptional regulation at steady state, and a birth-death model with time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>A 2-approximation algorithm for the softwired parsimony problem on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the most parsimonious tree inside a phylogenetic network with respect to a given character is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that for many network topologies is essentially inapproximable. In contrast, if the network is a rooted tree, then Fitch's well-known algorithm calculates an optimal parsimony score for that character in polynomial time. Drawing inspiration from this we here introduce a new extension of Fitch's algorithm which runs in polynomial time and ensures an approximation factor of 2 on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks, a popular topologically-restricted subclass of phylogenetic networks in the literature. Specifically, we show that Fitch's algorithm can be seen as a primal-dual algorithm, how it can be extended to binary, tree-child networks and that the approximation guarantee of this extension is tight. These results for a classic problem in phylogenetics strengthens the link between polyhedral methods and phylogenetics and can aid in the study of other related optimization problems on phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Model-Free and Real-Time Bioinspired Unicycle-Based Source Seeking: Differential Wheeled Robotic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioinspred robots aimed at source-seeking are often studied, and their controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</description>
