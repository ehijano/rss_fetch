      <title>Searching for the Flavon in the diphoton channel at future super hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of a CP-even flavon $H_F$ in proton-proton collisions and the prospects for its detection via the diphoton channel at future super hadron colliders, i.e., $pp\to H_F\to\gamma\gamma$. The theoretical framework adopted is a model that invokes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an Abelian flavor symmetry, which includes a Higgs doublet and a complex singlet. We confront the free parameters of the model against theoretical and experimental constraints to find the allowed parameter space, which is then used to evaluate the production cross section of the flavon and the branching ratio of its decay into two photons. We find promising results based on specific benchmark points, achieving signal significances at the level of 5$\sigma$ for flavon masses in the interval $200\lesssim M_{H_F}\lesssim 450$ and integrated luminosities in the range $5-12$ ab$^{-1}$ at the future High-Energy LHC. On the other hand, the Future hadron-hadron Circular Collider could probe masses up to 1 TeV if it reaches an integrated luminosity of at least 2 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Visualizing How the Structure of Large-Radius Jets Shapes Their Wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration has introduced and implemented a strategy for selecting and analyzing large-radius jets composed of skinny $R=0.2$ subjets in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We show how measurements of these jets teach us about the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and can teach us how jet substructure shapes the wakes that jets excite in the QGP droplets through which they pass. We use Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce measurements of $R_{AA}$ for large-radius jets in PbPb collisions, and study their dependence on the angle between the two skinny subjets involved in the final reclustering step of an $R=1$ jet. We show how these observables can constrain the value of $L_{\rm res}$ and demonstrate that the ATLAS data rule out any picture in which an entire parton shower loses energy coherently as if it were a single entity. Determining the degree to which the QGP can resolve partons within a jet is central to the broader program of using jet quenching measurements to probe QGP.
  We make further use of this setup by analyzing the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in a droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when they are $\sim 0.8- 1$ radian apart, a single broad wake is produced. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart is the presence of two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes jet wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only those hadrons with low $p_T$. These observables thus offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet wakes in heavy ion collision data.</description>

      <title>$CP$ violation in the $HZZ$ vertex and left-right asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate new contributions to the $HZZ$ vertex from the Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) of the Higgs and $Z$ bosons. It is found that the $h_2^V$ and $h_3^V$ ($V=H$, $Z$) form factors can be induced through these couplings, and we present our results in terms of the Passarino-Veltman scalar functions. Using the current limits on $H\overline{t}c$ and $Z\overline{t}c$ couplings, we determine that the new contributions to the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_2^V$ are small in comparison to the Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, for the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^V$, the contributions can reach values as large as $10^{-6}$, five orders of magnitude larger than in the SM. Furthermore, we examine how these results influence the left-right asymmetries in the processes $H^\ast\to ZZ$ and $Z^\ast\to ZH$. Our findings indicate that significant deviations from the SM predictions may arise when FCNC contributions are considered.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Two-Body $B\to P (K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ Decays with $f_0(980)$ Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $CP$-averaged branching fractions and direct $CP$ asymmetries in the quasi-two-body decays $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )(K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ within the framework of perturbative QCD approach, where $P$ denotes light pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$,$K$). The timelike form factor $F_{S}(\omega)$, characterizing final-state interactions between collinear particles in the resonant region, is modeled through the revised relativistic Breit-Wigner formalism for the $S$-wave $f_0(980)$ resonance. Within the Gegenbauer moments of the $S$-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes constrained by current data, we predict the branching fractions of $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )(K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ to lie in the range of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$. Our calculations reveal that our theoretical results for some decay modes exhibit satisfactory agreement with existing measurements from the BaBar and Belle collaborations. Furthermore, we extract the corresponding branching fractions of $B \to P f_0(980)$ decays from the quasi-two-body counterparts $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )\pi^+\pi^-$ rather than $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )K^+K^-$. All predictions are awaiting experimental verification in current and upcoming collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Resummation for Lattice QCD Calculation of Generalized Parton Distributions at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) provides an approach to directly calculate the $x$-dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) on a Euclidean lattice through power expansion and a perturbative matching. When a parton's momentum becomes soft, the corresponding logarithms in the matching kernel become non-negligible at higher orders of perturbation theory, which requires a resummation. But the resummation for the off-forward matrix elements at nonzero skewness $\xi$ is difficult due to their multi-scale nature. In this work, we demonstrate that these logarithms are important only in the threshold limit, and derive the threshold factorization formula for the quasi-GPDs in LaMET. We then propose an approach to resum all the large logarithms based on the threshold factorization, which is implemented on a GPD model. We demonstrate that the LaMET prediction is reliable for $[-1+x_0,-\xi-x_0]\cup[-\xi+x_0,\xi-x_0]\cup[\xi+x_0,1-x_0]$, where $x_0$ is a cutoff depending on hard parton momenta. Through our numerical tests with the GPD model, we demonstrate that our method is self-consistent and that the inverse matching does not spread the nonperturbative effects or power corrections to the perturbatively calculable regions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the DGLAP resummation in the JIMWLK Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the recently derived equation that resums DGLAP corrections to the JIMWLK Hamiltonian in the simplified setting of the SU(2) gauge theory. We solve the equation numerically for the scattering matrix of a dressed gluon for a particular initial condition, that corresponds to a dipole initial state. As expected, the $S$-matrix of a single dressed gluon state ceases to be unitary if evolved to significant $\ln Q^2/Q_s^2$. Our numerical results indicate an interesting universal (independent of the coupling constant) pattern for this deviation from unitarity.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal short-distance constraints on hadronic light-by-light scattering and tensor meson contributions to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-distance constraints from the operator product expansion in QCD play an important role in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While conventional hadronic models involving a finite number of resonances fail to reproduce the correct power laws implied by them, holographic QCD has been shown to naturally incorporate the Melnikov-Vainshtein constraint on the longitudinal amplitude following from the triangle anomaly in the asymmetric limit, where one photon virtuality remains small compared to the others. This is saturated by an infinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the muon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive analysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance constraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the level of 81\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to the muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap, because in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only contributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint. Numerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the low-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a negligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining gap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete hadronic light-by-light contribution.</description>

      <title>Viscous effects of a hot QGP medium in time dependent magnetic field and their phenomenological significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time or equivalently, decrease with the strength of the magnetic field. To connect these observations with experiments, we have calculated the thermalization time, shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\eta /s$), and bulk viscosity to entropy ratio ($\zeta /s$).</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk which can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH. Moreover, we assume that a disk contains only a toroidal magnetic magnetic field of moderate strength. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>There is Room at the Top: Fundamental Quantum Limits for Detecting Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sky of astrophysical gravitational waves is expected to be quiet above $\sim 10{\rm kHz}$, which is the upper limit of characteristic frequencies of dynamical processes involving astrophysical black holes and neutron stars. Therefore, the ultrahigh ($\ge 10{\rm kHz}$) frequency window is particularly promising for detecting primordial gravitational waves, as isolating the contribution from the astrophysical foreground has always been a challenging problem for gravitational wave background detection at ${\rm nHz, mHz}$ and the audio band studied so far. While there are various types of detectors proposed targeting the ultra-high frequency gravitational waves, they have to satisfy the (loss-constrained) fundamental limits of quantum measurements. We develop a universal framework for the quantum limit under different measurement schemes and input quantum states, and apply them to several plausible detector configurations. The fundamental limits are expressed as the strength of gravitational wave background at different frequencies, which should serve as a lower limit for ultra-high frequency gravitational wave signal possibly detectable, to probe early-universe phase transitions, and/or other primordial gravitational wave sources. We discover that a GUT-motivated phase transition from $10^7-10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$ can naturally lead to possibly detectable GW signals within the band of $\rm{kHz-MHz}$. For phase transition above $10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$, the signals are however below the quantum limit and are thus not detectable. Ultra-high frequency GWs also provide a window to test topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings generated close to the GUT scale.</description>

      <title>Results on meson-meson scattering at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on the large $N_\text{c}$ scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes. We work in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate quark flavors and run lattice simulations with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 590$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators corresponding to two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. Using L\"uscher's quantization condition, we constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitudes and investigate subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections to the large $N_\text{c}$ limit. For one of the channels, we find indications of a virtual bound state at $N_\text{c}=3$, which may be related to one of the aforementioned exotic states.</description>

      <title>Temperature-redshift relation in energy-momentum-powered gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations includes a term proportional to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. Previous works have suggested that these models can lead to a recent accelerating universe without a cosmological constant, but they can also be seen as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, which are observationally constrained to be close to the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Here we show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and background cosmological data, showing that this power is constrained to be about $|n|&lt;0.01$ and $|n|&lt;0.1$, respectively in models without and with a cosmological constant, and improving previous constraints on this parameter by more than a factor of three. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic attractor in periodically driven ultracold quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. In particular, the rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. So far, hydrodynamic attractors have been explored only in systems undergoing monotonic expansion, such as Bjorken flow. We demonstrate that a system with an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel cyclic attractor behavior. This phenomenon can be investigated in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, offering a new avenue for experimentally discovering hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Study on the $P$-wave form factors contributing to $ B_s $ to $D_s$ inclusive semileptonic decays from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pilot study on extracting the form factors of the semileptonic decay of a $ B_s $ meson to the $P$-wave $ D_s^{**} $ states from $B_s$ four-point correlators. With their inclusive nature, four-point correlators include contributions from all possible final states. From the extracted $ P $-wave form factors, we obtain numerical results for the corresponding Isgur-Wise form factors. The results suggest significant contributions from radial excitations to the Uraltsev sum rule at zero-recoil. In this pilot study, a coarse lattice of $ 24^3\times 64 $ with lattice spacing of $0.11\,\mathrm{fm}$ is used for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Various constraints on BSM physics from extensive air showers and from ultra-high energy gamma-ray and neutrino searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various phenomena of physics beyond that of the Standard Model could occur at high scale. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the only particles available to explore scales above a few dozens of TeV. Although these explorations are much more limited than those carried out with colliders, they provide a series of constraints in several topics such as tests of Lorentz invariance, dark matter, phase transitions in the early universe or sterile neutrinos. Several of these constraints are reviewed in these proceedings of UHECR2024 based on searches for anomalous characteristics in extensive air showers or searches for ultra-high energy gamma rays and neutrinos.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-luminosity Super $\tau$-Charm Factory (STCF) will be a crucial facility for charm-physics research, particularly for the precise measurement of electroweak parameters, measuring $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing parameters, investigating Charge-Parity (CP) violation within the charm sector, searching for the rare and forbidden decays of charmed hadrons, and addressing other foundational questions related to charmed hadrons. With the world's largest charm-threshold data, the STCF aims to achieve high sensitivity in studying the strong phase of neutral $D$ mesons using quantum correlation, complementing studies at LHCb and Belle II, and contributing to the understanding of CP violations globally. The STCF will also enable world-leading precision in measuring the leptonic decays of charmed mesons and baryons, providing constraints on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and strong-force dynamics. Additionally, the STCF will explore charmed hadron spectroscopy. The advanced detector and clean experimental environment of the STCF will enable unprecedented precision, help address key challenges in the Standard Model, and facilitate the search for potential new physics.</description>

      <title>$A_{5}$ symmetry and deviation from Golden Ratio mixing with charged lepton flavor violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A neutrino mass model that can satisfy the exact golden ratio mixing is constructed using $A_{5}$ discrete symmetry group. The deviation from the golden ratio mixing is studied by considering the contribution from the charged lepton sector in a linear seesaw framework. A definite pattern of charged lepton mass matrix predicted by the model controls the leptonic mixing angles. By taking the observed $\theta_{13}$ as the input value, we can obtain the values of all the mixing angles and Dirac CP-violating phase within the current experimental bounds.
  The model predicts that only the normal neutrino mass ordering is consistent with the current oscillation data. We also study the two body charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes such as $\mu \rightarrow e +\gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow e +\gamma$ and $\tau \rightarrow \mu+ \gamma$ and neutrinoless double beta decay parameter $m_{\beta \beta}$. The present neutrino mass model can explain the current and future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow e +\gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow e+ \gamma$ processes and the present sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decay parameter when the masses of quasi-Dirac neutrinos are in the TeV range. On the other hand, the model cannot reproduce the present sensitivity of $\tau \rightarrow \mu+ \gamma$ but can explain the future sensitivity and the present sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decay parameter simultaneously when the masses of the quasi-Dirac neutrinos are in the TeV range.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the stability of the electroweak vacuum with respect to vacuum tunneling to the Komatsu vacuum, which exists when $m_L^2 + m_{H_u}^2&lt;0$, in the cMSSM. Employing the numerical tools SARAH, SPheno and CosmoTransitions, we scan and constrain the parameter space of the cMSSM up to 10 TeV. Regions excluded due to having a vacuum tunneling half-life less than the age of the observable universe are concentrated near the regions where the electroweak vacuum is tachyonic and are more stringent at smaller $m_0$, larger and negative $A_0$, and larger $\tan\beta$. New excluded regions, which satisfy $m_h \simeq 125 \text{GeV}$, are found.</description>

      <title>Electroweak corrections and EFT operators in $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of electroweak corrections and effective field theory operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing the Standard Model effective-field theory (SMEFT) framework, we extend the Standard Model by incorporating higher-dimensional operators to encapsulate potential new physics effects. These operators allow for a model-independent approach to data interpretation, essential for probing beyond the Standard Model physics. We generate pseudodata at the next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics and include approximate electroweak corrections. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between these corrections and SMEFT operators at leading order. The inclusion of electroweak corrections is crucial as they can counteract the effects predicted by SMEFT operators, necessitating precise theoretical and experimental handling. By examining $pp\to W^+ W^-$ production, a process sensitive to the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism, we demonstrate the importance of these corrections in isolating and interpreting new physics signatures. Our results highlight the significant role of electroweak corrections in enhancing the interpretative power of LHC data and in obtaining reliable constraints on new physics interactions.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that, the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small, and future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as the precision tests of the SM advances, rarer processes with a greater number of final-state particles will require consideration, which will in turn require the analysis of a multitude of observables. As an inherent consequence of the high luminosity, the generation of a large amount of experimental data in a large feature space presents a significant challenge for data processing. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm; the VQSN, however, introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As an example, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the gluon quartic gauge couplings~(gQGCs) at the Large Hadron Collider. The results suggest that VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos as well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and spin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken into account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino arriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii, magnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments are outlined.</description>

      <title>Probing low-reheating scenarios with minimal freeze-in dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter space of freeze-in dark matter (DM) with mass $m_\chi$ through light dark photon (``minimal freeze-in DM'') is currently being probed by direct detection experiments through electron and nuclear recoil. Exploring the DM production in the mass range $10^{-2}~{\rm MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10^3$ TeV, we quantify the impact of quantum statistics and the reheating dynamics (beyond the instantaneous reheating approximation) on the DM production in the early universe, in particular, the dependence on the cosmic equation of state and the scaling of the temperature of the Standard Model bath during reheating. Special cases corresponding to matter-domination and kination are carefully studied. To fit the entire observed DM relic abundance, low-temperature reheating scenarios require an increase in the coupling between dark and visible sectors which, in turn, enhances the regions of the parameter space that are already tested and will be probed by next-generation direct detection experiments for diverse reheating scenarios.</description>

      <title>How many interactions does it take to modify a jet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a continued open question how there can be an azimuthal anisotropy of high $p_\perp$ particles quantified by a sizable $v_2$ in p+Pb collisions when, at the same time, the nuclear modification factor $R_\text{AA}$ is consistent with unity. We address this puzzle within the framework of the jet quenching model \textsc{Jewel}. In the absence of reliable medium models for small collision systems we use the number of scatterings per parton times the squared Debye mass to characterise the strength of medium modifications. Working with a simple brick medium model we show that, for small systems and not too strong modifications, $R_\text{AA}$ and $v_2$ approximately scale with this quantity. We find that a comparatively large number of scatterings is needed to generate measurable jet quenching. Our results indicate that the $R_\text{AA}$ corresponding to the observed $v_2$ could fall within the experimental uncertainty. Thus, while there is currently no contradiction with the measurements, our results indicate that $v_2$ and $R_\text{AA}$ go hand-in-hand. We also discuss departures from scaling, in particular, due to sizable inelastic energy loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.2 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinear causality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it is believed that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts to behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no means trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the fluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear causality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the inverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid. The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality conditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies per rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper time and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This analysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than the framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.</description>
