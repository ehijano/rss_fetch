      <title>Recognizing Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of monoids in the study of word languages recognized by finite-state automata has been quite fruitful. In this work, we look at the same idea of "recognizability by finite monoids" for other monoids. In particular, we attempt to characterize recognizable subsets of various additive and multiplicative monoids over integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers. While these recognizable sets satisfy properties such as closure under Boolean operations and inverse morphisms, they do not enjoy many of the nice properties that recognizable word languages do.</description>

      <title>Pumping-Like Results for Copyless Cost Register Automata and Polynomially Ambiguous Weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider two rich subclasses of weighted automata over fields: polynomially ambiguous weighted automata and copyless cost register automata. Primarily we are interested in understanding their expressiveness power. Over the rational field and 1-letter alphabets, it is known that the two classes coincide; they are equivalent to linear recurrence sequences (LRS) whose exponential bases are roots of rationals. We develop two pumping-like results over arbitrary fields with unrestricted alphabets, one for each class. As a corollary of these results, we present examples proving that the two classes become incomparable over the rational field with unrestricted alphabets.
  We complement the results by analysing the zeroness and equivalence problems. For weighted automata (even unrestricted) these problems are well understood: there are polynomial time, and even NC$^2$ algorithms. For copyless cost register automata we show that the two problems are \textsc{PSpace}-complete, where the difficulty is to show the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Reachability and Related Problems in Vector Addition Systems with Nested Zero Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector addition systems with states (VASS), also known as Petri nets, are a popular model of concurrent systems. Many problems from many areas reduce to the reachability problem for VASS, which consists of deciding whether a target configuration of a VASS is reachable from a given initial configuration. In this paper, we obtain an Ackermannian (primitive-recursive in fixed dimension) upper bound for the reachability problem in VASS with nested zero tests. Furthermore, we provide a uniform approach which also allows to decide most related problems, for example semilinearity and separability, in the same complexity. For some of these problems like semilinearity the complexity was unknown even for plain VASS.</description>

      <title>Completely reachable automata: a quadratic decision algorithm and a quadratic upper bound on the reaching threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete deterministic finite (semi)automaton (DFA) with a set of states $Q$ is \emph{completely reachable} if every nonempty subset of $Q$ is the image of the action of some word applied to $Q$. The concept of completely reachable automata appeared, in particular, in connection with synchronizing automata; the class contains the \v{C}ern{\'y} automata and covers several distinguished subclasses. The notion was introduced by Bondar and Volkov (2016), who also raised the question about the complexity of deciding if an automaton is completely reachable. We develop an algorithm solving this problem, which works in ${\mathcal{O}(|\Sigma|\cdot n^2)}$ time and $\mathcal{O}(|\Sigma|\cdot n)$ space, where $n=|Q|$ is the number of states and $|\Sigma|$ is the size of the input alphabet. In the second part, we prove a weak Don's conjecture for this class of automata: a nonempty subset of states $S \subseteq Q$ is reachable with a word of length at most $2n(n-|S|) - n \cdot H_{n-|S|}$, where $H_i$ is the $i$-th harmonic number. This implies a quadratic upper bound in $n$ on the length of the shortest synchronizing words (reset threshold) for the class of completely reachable automata and generalizes earlier upper bounds derived for its subclasses.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Linear Temporal Logic for Pomset Languages of Higher Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logics are a powerful tool to specify properties of computational systems. For concurrent programs, Higher Dimensional Automata (HDA) are a very expressive model of non-interleaving concurrency. HDA recognize languages of partially ordered multisets, or pomsets. Recent work has shown that Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic is as expressive as HDA for pomset languages. In this paper, we investigate the class of pomset languages that are definable in First Order (FO) logic. As expected, this is a strict subclass of MSO-definable languages. In the case of words, Kamp's theorem states that FO is as expressive as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our aim is to prove a variant of Kamp's theorem for pomset languages. Thus, we define a temporal logic called Sparse Pomset Temporal Logic (SPTL), and show that it is equivalent to FO, when there is no autoconcurrency.</description>
