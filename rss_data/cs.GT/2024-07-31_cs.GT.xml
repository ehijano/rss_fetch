      <title>LiteEFG: An Efficient Python Library for Solving Extensive-form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiteEFG is an efficient library with easy-to-use Python bindings, which can solve multiplayer extensive-form games (EFGs). LiteEFG enables the user to express computation graphs in Python to define updates on the game tree structure. The graph is then executed by the C++ backend, leading to significant speedups compared to running the algorithm in Python. Moreover, in LiteEFG, the user needs to only specify the computation graph of the update rule in a decision node of the game, and LiteEFG will automatically distribute the update rule to each decision node and handle the structure of the imperfect-information game.</description>

      <title>Escape Sensing Games: Detection-vs-Evasion in Security Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional game-theoretic research for security applications primarily focuses on the allocation of external protection resources to defend targets. This work puts forward the study of a new class of games centered around strategically arranging targets to protect them against a constrained adversary, with motivations from varied domains such as peacekeeping resource transit and cybersecurity. Specifically, we introduce Escape Sensing Games (ESGs). In ESGs, a blue player manages the order in which targets pass through a channel, while her opponent tries to capture the targets using a set of sensors that need some time to recharge after each activation. We present a thorough computational study of ESGs. Among others, we show that it is NP-hard to compute best responses and equilibria. Nevertheless, we propose a variety of effective (heuristic) algorithms whose quality we demonstrate in extensive computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Embracing Fairness in Consumer Electricity Markets using an Automatic Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As consumer flexibility becomes expected, it is important that the market mechanisms which attain that flexibility are perceived as fair. We set out fairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address them. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different prices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated using a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the system over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against more classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Fair Incentives for Repeated Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a decision-maker's problem of finding optimal monetary incentive schemes for retention when faced with agents whose participation decisions (stochastically) depend on the incentive they receive. Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.</description>

      <title>An Abundance of Katherines: The Game Theory of Baby Naming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniqueness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Best-response algorithms for a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the convergence properties of traditional best-response (BR) algorithms in computing solutions to mixed-integer Nash equilibrium problems (MI-NEPs) that turn into a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems (NEPs) once relaxed the integer restrictions. We show that the sequence produced by a Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel BR method always approaches a bounded region containing the entire solution set of the MI-NEP, whose tightness depends on the problem data, and it is related to the degree of strong monotonicity of the relaxed NEP. When the underlying algorithm is applied to the relaxed NEP, we establish data-dependent complexity results characterizing its convergence to the unique solution of the NEP. In addition, we derive one of the very few sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to MI-NEPs. The theoretical results developed bring important practical benefits, illustrated on a numerical instance of a smart building control application.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent, Human-Agent and Beyond: A Survey on Cooperation in Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of cooperation within social dilemmas has long been a fundamental topic across various disciplines, including computer science and social science. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly reshaped this field, offering fresh insights into understanding and enhancing cooperation. This survey examines three key areas at the intersection of AI and cooperation in social dilemmas. First, focusing on multi-agent cooperation, we review the intrinsic and external motivations that support cooperation among rational agents, and the methods employed to develop effective strategies against diverse opponents. Second, looking into human-agent cooperation, we discuss the current AI algorithms for cooperating with humans and the human biases towards AI agents. Third, we review the emergent field of leveraging AI agents to enhance cooperation among humans. We conclude by discussing future research avenues, such as using large language models, establishing unified theoretical frameworks, revisiting existing theories of human cooperation, and exploring multiple real-world applications.</description>
