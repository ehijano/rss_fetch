      <title>Symplectic quandle Method and $SL(2,\mathbb C)$-representations of 2-bridge Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the symplectic quandle method, previously employed in our study of parabolic representations of knot groups, to investigate the general $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-representations of 2-bridge ``kmot" groups. We introduce a `generalized symplectic quandle structure' corresponding to ($\mathcal{D}_M$, conjugation) for each $M\in\mathbb C\setminus \{0,1,-1\}$, where $\mathcal{D}_M=\{A\in SL(2,\mathbb{C})\mid tr(A)= M+M^{-1} \}$. By converting the system of conjugation quandle equations to that of generalized symplectic quandle equations, we obtain a simpler expression for the 2-variable Riley polynomial and derive some recursive formulas for Riley polynomials and Alexander polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively compute the A-polynomials, allowing us to obtain numerous previously unknown A-polynomials within minutes using Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Skeins, $q$-series, and modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study BPS $q$-series associated to 3-manifolds decorated by a line defect along an embedded link. We prove that these $q$-series depend only on the class of the link in the skein module, thereby defining a homomorphism from the skein module to the space of $q$-series. The image of this homomorphism is conjectured to be holomorphically quantum modular, which suggests a new approach to Langlands duality for skein modules through $q$-series.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the $sl(n)$ Polynomial to Knotted 4-Valent Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use planar 4-valent graphs and a graphical calculus involving such graphs to construct an invariant for balanced-oriented, knotted 4-valent graphs. Our invariant is an extension of the $sl(n)$ polynomial for classical knots and links. We also provide a minimal generating set of Reidemeister-type moves for diagrams of balanced-oriented, knotted 4-valent graphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that the knots $K\in\{4_1,5_1\}$ can be paired with a corresponding knot $K^\prime$ such that $u(K\#K^\prime)&lt;u(K)+u(K^\prime)$. As a consequence unknotting number fails to be additive for these knots. We also provide a candidate knot $K^\prime$ for the knot $3_1$.</description>

      <title>On Proper Descent of Smooth Affine Surfaces with Finite Homotopy Rank-Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the descent behaviour of homotopy-theoretic properties of smooth complex affine surfaces under finite surjective morphisms. We first examine the Eilenberg-MacLane property and show, by means of an explicit counterexample, that it does not descend under proper morphisms in general. This negative result motivates the introduction of a weaker notion, the finite homotopy rank-sum property. Our main theorem establishes that this property does descend under proper morphisms between smooth affine surfaces of logarithmic Kodaira dimension at most zero. The proof relies essentially on the recent classification of smooth complex affine surfaces of log non-general type characterized by these two properties. As a further application, we classify smooth affine surfaces properly dominated by the complex algebraic 2-torus, thereby clarifying an earlier remark of M. Furushima.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric rigidity of the integers: an elementary primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chatawate (Flame) Ruethaimetapat was a passionate, enthusiastic, and wonderful person who passed away in August of 2024. At the time of their passing they were working towards their PhD, specializing in geometric group theory. Flame was just as excited about learning new mathematics as they were about sharing it with everyone else, so it's no surprise that they spent a lot of time thinking about how to write down expository proofs of classical theorems that would be accessible for first year students. In particular, they sought a simple, elementary proof of the fact that any finitely generated group quasi-isometric to the integers is virtually the integers. In the spirit of this endeavor and in loving memory of Flame, we present such a proof here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a polynomial factorization problem that naturally arises from Hartley's factorization condition on the Alexander polynomial of freely periodic knots. We give a number-theoretic interpretation of this factorization condition, which allows for efficient computation. As an application, we prove that any polynomial which is not a product of cyclotomic polynomials can be the Alexander polynomial of a freely p-periodic knot for only finitely many p. As a demonstration of the computational efficiency of these methods, we also show that the Alexander polynomial of any freely-periodic L-space knot with genus at most 16 must be a product of cyclotomic polynomials. We conjecture that any periodic or freely periodic L-space knot must be an iterated torus knot.</description>

      <title>On the monodromy and spin parity of single-cylinder origamis in the minimal stratum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper with Menasco-Nieland, the first author constructed factorially many origamis in the minimal stratum of the moduli space of translation surfaces having simultaneously a single vertical cylinder and a single horizontal cylinder. Moreover, these origamis were constructed using the minimal number of squares required for origamis in the minimal stratum. We shall call such origamis minimal $[1,1]$-origamis.
  In this work, we calculate all of the spin parities of the Aougab-Menasco-Nieland origamis, and we therefore determine the connected component of the minimal stratum within which each is contained. Motivated by understanding the $\SL(2,\Z)$-orbits of these origamis, we investigate their monodromy groups, in particular proving that all of them are alternating or projective special linear groups. In fact, we prove more generally that the monodromy group of a minimal $[1,1]$-origami must almost always be a finite simple group. Finally, we determine the Kontsevich-Zorich monodromies of these origamis in low genus and give a conjecture in general.
  Note that previous works in the literature (e.g., that of Eskin-Kontsevich-Zorich, Filip-Forni-Matheus, Guti\'{e}rrez-Romo, Kany-Matheus, Matheus-Yoccoz-Zmiaikou, and Zorich) often chose to discuss just one of these $\SL(2,\Z)$-invariants at a time: in particular, to the best our knowledge, this is one of the first places where all of these $\SL(2,\Z)$-invariants are computed explicitly in a single paper for such a large family of origamis.</description>

      <title>Coning off totally geodesic boundary components of a hyperbolic manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let M be a compact hyperbolic manifold with totally geodesic boundary. If the injectivity radius of the boundary is larger than an explicit function of the normal injectivity radius of the boundary, we show that there is a negatively curved metric on the space obtained by coning each boundary component of M to a point. Moreover, we give explicit geometric conditions under which a locally convex subset of M gives rise to a locally convex subset of the cone-off.
  Group-theoretically, we conclude that the fundamental group of the cone-off is hyperbolic and the image of the fundamental group of the coned-off locally convex subset is a quasi-convex subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotics of shortest filling closed multi-geodesics of closed hyperbolic surfaces as systole $\to 0$ or as genus $\to \infty$. We first show that for a closed hyperbolic surface $X_g$ of genus $g$, the length of a shortest filling closed multi-geodesic of $X_g$ is uniformly comparable to $$\left(g+\sum\limits_{\textit{closed geodesic }\gamma\subset X_g, \ \ell(\gamma)&lt;1}\log \left(\frac{1}{\ell(\gamma)}\right)\right).$$ As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, a Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surface has a shortest closed multi-geodesic of length uniformly comparable to $g$. We also show that this is true for a random hyperbolic surface in the Brooks-Makover model.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a collection of subgroups of the mapping class group of a surface such that the associated coset intersection complex is quasi-isometric and homotopy equivalent to the curve complex. Moreover, we prove that these two complexes are combinatorially equivalent in the sense that one can be obtained from the other via taking a nerve. As an application, we prove that the automorphism group of this coset intersection complex is the extended mapping class group, providing new examples for Ivanov's metaconjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a spherical knot mosaic where a knot is represented by tiling the surface of a topological 2-sphere with 11 canonical knot mosaic tiles and show this gives rise to several novel knot (and link) invariants: the spherical mosaic number, spherical tiling number, minimal spherical mosaic tiling number, spherical face number, spherical n-mosaic face number, and minimal spherical mosaic face number. We show examples where this framework offers an improvement over classical knot mosaics. Furthermore, we explore several bounds involving classical knot invariants derived from these spherical mosaic invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a connected component of the space of conjugacy classes of representations of the modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ into the isometry group of the symmetric space $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}(3)$. This connected component contains the family of representations constructed by Schwartz via Pappus' theorem, as well as their Anosov deformations studied by Barbot, Lee, and Val\'erio. We show that certain representations in this component (far from the Schwartz representations) are Anosov. The main results of this paper were previously proved by Schwartz in arXiv:2412.18457, though with different arguments. I was unaware of arXiv:2412.18457 when I posted the first version of this paper.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi-Yau categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple topological field theory and $\widehat{Z}$-invariants from $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct three-dimensional non-semisimple topological field theories from the unrolled quantum group of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. More precisely, the quantum group depends on a root of unity $q=e^{\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{-1}}{r}}$, where $r$ is a positive integer greater than $2$, and the construction applies when $r$ is not congruent to $4$ modulo $8$. The algebraic result which underlies the construction is the existence of a relative modular structure on the non-finite, non-semisimple category of weight modules for the quantum group. We prove a Verlinde formula which allows for the computation of dimensions and Euler characteristics of topological field theory state spaces of unmarked surfaces. When $r$ is congruent to $\pm 1$ or $\pm 2$ modulo $8$, we relate the resulting $3$-manifold invariants with physicists' $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. Finally, we establish a relation between $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$ which was conjectured in the physics literature.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the generic fibre of the Betti moduli space associated to any of the ten Painlev\'e equations coincides with the result of attaching Weinstein handles along the Stokes Legendrian, and provide Weinstein handlebody diagrams for each of them in the process. We moreover extend the procedure for obtaining presentations in Gompf normal form of Weinstein manifolds obtained by attaching handles to Legendrian lifts of cooriented curves in surfaces to their unit cotangent bundle to the case where the surface may have nonempty boundary.</description>
