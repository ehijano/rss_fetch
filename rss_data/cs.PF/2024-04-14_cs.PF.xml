      <title>Updates on the Low-Level Abstraction of Memory Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choosing the best memory layout for each hardware architecture is increasingly important as more and more programs become memory bound. For portable codes that run across heterogeneous hardware architectures, the choice of the memory layout for data structures is ideally decoupled from the rest of a program. The low-level abstraction of memory access (LLAMA) is a C++ library that provides a zero-runtime-overhead abstraction layer, underneath which memory mappings can be freely exchanged to customize data layouts, memory access and access instrumentation, focusing on multidimensional arrays of nested, structured data.
  After its scientific debut, several improvements and extensions have been added to LLAMA. This includes compile-time array extents for zero-memory-overhead views, support for computations during memory access, new mappings for bit-packing, switching types, byte-splitting, memory access instrumentation, and explicit SIMD support. This contribution provides an overview of recent developments in the LLAMA library.</description>

      <title>Tail Optimality and Performance Analysis of the Nudge-M Scheduling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the response time of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling can be stochastically and asymptotically improved upon by the {\it Nudge} scheduling algorithm in case of light-tailed job size distributions. Such improvements are feasible even when the jobs are partitioned into two types and the scheduler only has information about the type of incoming jobs (but not their size).
  In this paper we introduce Nudge-$M$ scheduling, where basically any incoming type-1 job is allowed to pass any type-2 job that is still waiting in the queue given that it arrived as one of the last $M$ jobs. We prove that Nudge-$M$ has an asymptotically optimal response time within a large family of Nudge scheduling algorithms when job sizes are light-tailed. Simple explicit results for the asymptotic tail improvement ratio (ATIR) of Nudge-$M$ over FCFS are derived as well as explicit results for the optimal parameter $M$. An expression for the ATIR that only depends on the type-1 and type-2 mean job sizes and the fraction of type-1 jobs is presented in the heavy traffic setting.
  The paper further presents a numerical method to compute the response time distribution and mean response time of Nudge-$M$ scheduling provided that the job size distribution of both job types follows a phase-type distribution (by making use of the framework of Markov modulated fluid queues with jumps).</description>
