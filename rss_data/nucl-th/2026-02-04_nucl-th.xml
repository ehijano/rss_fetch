      <title>Anisotropic time evolution of sound modes in Bjorken expanding holographic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of sound is a key parameter for characterizing equilibrium states. However, sound waves change their properties when propagating through rapidly evolving anisotropic media, such as the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. This paper uses $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory to numerically study the time evolution of the speed and attenuation of sound modes along with the relaxation time in a plasma undergoing Bjorken expansion from various initial states in a quasi-static approximation. The longitudinal Bjorken expansion breaks the isotropy, resulting in two distinct sound speeds that range from just below the conformal value to the speed of light. An anisotropic hydrodynamic description is constructed and its applicability is discussed. Implications for the analysis of heavy ion data are considered.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Smoothness and On-Shell Approximations in Femtoscopy and Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce femtometer-scale sources whose space-time structure can be constrained using two-particle femtoscopic correlations. Standard implementations rely on the smoothness and on-shell approximations, which effectively remove the relative momentum dependence of the particle emission function. We explore the validity of these approximations by deriving model-independent expansions that quantify the leading corrections for femtoscopy and coalescence with arbitrary sources and final-state interactions. The resulting first- and second-order correction terms can be evaluated with essentially the same numerical complexity as the usual Koonin-Pratt expressions; for angle-averaged correlations the first-order contributions vanish by symmetry. We illustrate the framework with explicit calculations in a blast-wave source model. For parameter sets representative of pp and PbPb fits at LHC energies, the corrections are at or below the percent level for pp correlations and deuteron coalescence.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness and its volume and surface contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the neutron skin thickness ($\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$) in finite nuclei is crucial for constraining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In this work, we systematically investigate $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$ in the transuranium berkelium (Bk) isotopic chain using the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). Our results reveal a general increase of $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$ with neutron number $N$, which exhibits anti-kinks at the shell closures $N = 184, 258$ due to the shell effects. By decomposing $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$ into volume and surface contributions through two-parameter Fermi (2pF) fits to angle-averaged DRHBc densities, we find that the volume term accounts for as much as $68\%$ in most nuclei, whereas the surface term dominates only near the proton drip line for $N &lt; 142$. Nuclear deformation is shown to slightly reduce the central radius $R_c$ while significantly enhancing the surface diffuseness $a$, resulting in a notable increase in $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$ that is largely driven by the surface term. Moreover, by extracting 2pF parameters along the symmetry axis ($\theta = 0^\circ$) and perpendicular to it ($\theta = 90^\circ$), we examine the anisotropy of $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$. In prolate deformed nuclei, a pronounced directional dependence emerges: although the nucleus elongates along the symmetry axis, $\Delta R_{\mathrm{np}}$ is substantially larger in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy is weak for oblate nuclei near shell closures. The anisotropy of $\Delta R_{\rm np}$ is attributed mainly to the volume term, which remains the dominant contribution in most nuclei regardless of direction. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between deformation, shell structure, and the neutron skin in finite nuclei.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hyperon Skyrme Forces in Multi-$\Lambda$ Hypernuclei and Neutron Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major source of uncertainty in modeling the strangeness-rich interiors of neutron stars arises from the poorly constrained two-body and three-body interactions among hyperons and nucleons. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\Lambda N$ interaction parameters within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework, constrained by both hypernuclei experimental data and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the parameter space of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction is tightly constrained by combining nuclear and astrophysical data, while the parameters of the $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body interaction remain sensitive to astrophysical inputs alone. Specifically, the local, momentum-independent two-body interaction parameter $\lambda_0$ is tightly constrained and predominantly attractive, while the momentum-dependent parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ contribute repulsive effects at high densities. A key role is played by the $\Lambda\Lambda$ potential depth in pure $\Lambda$ matter, which effectively constrains the two-body $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction and governs the balance between attraction at low densities and repulsion at high densities. The repulsive components of $\Lambda\Lambda$ interactions then decrease hyperon fractions and reconcile hyperon-rich equations of state with the observed $\sim2\,M_{\odot}$ neutron stars, increasing the maximum mass by up to 22\%. The inclusion of $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body forces further stiffens the EOS, raising the maximum mass by up to $\sim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$. Our study represents a promising step toward a complete, experimentally grounded description of dense matter across a wide range of densities and strangeness compositions.</description>

      <title>The favoured twin: on the dynamical response of twin stars to perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a strong first-order phase transition takes place at sufficiently high rest-mass densities in the equation of state (EOS) modelling compact stars, a new branch will appear in the mass-radius sequence of stable equilibria. This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Thermalization and Multi-Freeze-Out Effects in Pb-Pb collisions Based on Tsallis pT Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates transverse-momentum (pT) distributions of pi-, pi+, K-, K+, p, pbar, K0s, and Lambda in several centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV. The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.
  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics. These observations provide new insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Nuclear De-Excitation at SBND with Ab Initio Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment to light dark matter using MeV-scale electromagnetic activity. Inelastic scattering of dark matter with argon nuclei can excite nuclear states that subsequently de-excite via the emission of MeV-scale photons, producing localized low-energy "blip" signatures in a liquid argon time projection chamber. We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals. After accounting for relevant backgrounds, we find that SBND can probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space for light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Contact interaction treatment of the nucleon Faddeev equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI), a largely algebraic three-body Faddeev equation treatment of the nucleon bound state problem is introduced and used to deliver results for all nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions and their flavour separation. A strength of the SCI treatment is that it provides for a transparent understanding of this three-body approach to developing predictions for baryon observables. Comparisons of SCI results with predictions obtained in realistic-interaction Faddeev equation studies reveal the sensitivities of given observable to phenomena associated with the emergence of hadron mass.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the pion-nucleon coupling constant using the effective-range expansion with the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the generalized effective-range expansion of Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 011903(2025), which incorporates the left-hand cut from one-pion exchange, to low-energy neutron-proton scattering in the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ channels. The amplitude zero for the center-of-mass momentum near 0.35 GeV in the $^1S_0$ channel is naturally accommodated within this framework. We extract the pole position, scattering length, effective range, and the pseudoscalar pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ at different expansion orders. The low-energy parameters are stable and consistent with established values, while $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ exhibits larger uncertainties. The extraction of $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation. Despite larger uncertainties compared to high-precision extractions, the consistency with established values demonstrates that this framework can probe the left-hand-cut singularity.</description>

      <title>Probing $NN\Omega_{ccc}$ three-body systems with the modern QCD $N\Omega_{ccc}$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newly, first-principles lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass, $ m_\pi \backsimeq 137.1 $ MeV, have been reported by the HAL QCD Collaboration for the S-wave interaction between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{ccc}$). The $N\Omega_{ccc}$ potentials in the spin-1 $ \left(^{3}S_{1}\right) $ and spin-2 $ \left(^{5}S_{2}\right) $ channels were derived and found to be attractive, though no two-body bound state was supported in these channels.
  The present work investigates the $NN\Omega_{ccc}$ three-body system
  using the Malfliet-Tjon $NN$ potential. Analyses of spin-1, spin-averaged, and spin-2 $N\Omega_{ccc}$ channels (at Euclidean times 16, 17, 18) reveal a three-body bound state only for the d-$\Omega_{ccc}$ configuration with spin $(0)1/2^{+}$ and $t/a=16$. Its binding energy ($B_3 = -2.255$ MeV) lies slightly below the deuteron's ($B_d = -2.23$ MeV).
  Other parameter sets do not yield a bound state,
  and complex scaling analysis indicates these configurations correspond to virtual states rather than resonances.
  The Coulomb potential's role was also examined to differentiate charged states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the pentaquark systems with quark contents $qqqq\bar{c}$ with the analyzed total spin and parity quantum numbers of $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$, $J^{P}=\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ and $J^{P}=\frac{5}{2}^{-}$, in the I=0, I=1 and I=2 isospin channels. The effective potentials between baryon and meson clusters are given, and the possible bound states are also investigated. Also, the study of the scattering process of the open channels is performed to identify possible resonance states. Our estimations indicate that several possible bound states and narrow baryon-meson resonances are found from corresponding the calculation processes. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurement, we also extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the femtoscopic correlation functions for the $N\bar{D}$ system using the CATS framework. The results demonstrate that the predicted $I=0$ bound state manifests as a significant enhancement at low momentum accompanied by a characteristic suppression. In contrast, the $I=1$ correlations remain relatively flat as the predicted resonances are kinematically distant from the threshold. The $I=2$ sector exhibits strong spin dependence, where the bound state signal in the $J=1/2^{-}$ channel is largely masked by repulsive components in spin-averaged observables. This cancellation effect suggests that future experimental searches at ALICE and LHCb may require spin-selective measurements to identify such states. These predictions provide crucial theoretical guidance for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Can negative bare couplings make sense? The $\vec{\phi}^4$ theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in 3+1D, for a positive coupling constant $\lambda&gt;0$, is known to have no interacting continuum limit, which is referred to as quantum triviality. However, it has been recently argued that the theory in 3+1D with an $N$-component scalar $\vec{\phi}$ and a $(\vec{\phi}\cdot\vec{\phi})^{\,2}=\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ interaction term does have an interacting continuum limit at large $N$. It has been suggested that this continuum limit has a negative (bare) coupling constant and exhibits asymptotic freedom, similar to the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric $-g\phi^4$ field theory. In this paper I study the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory in 3+1D at large $N$ with a negative coupling constant $-g&lt;0$, and with the scalar field taking values in a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric complex domain. The theory is non-trivial, has asymptotic freedom, and has a Landau pole in the IR, and I demonstrate that the thermal partition function matches that of the positive-coupling $\lambda&gt;0$ theory when the Landau poles of the two theories (in the $\lambda&gt;0$ case a pole in the UV) are identified with one another. The spirit of renormalization is that observables do not depend on the renormalization scale. Here we see even if the coupling is taken negative above the scale of the Landau pole, thermodynamic observables are unaffected. Thus the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory at large $N$ appears to have a negative bare coupling constant; the coupling only becomes positive in the IR, which in the context of other $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric and large-$N$ quantum field theories I argue is perfectly acceptable.</description>

      <title>Compact object of HESS J1731-347 and its implication on neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\odot$ within $90\%$ confidence interval, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

      <title>Momentum Flow Mechanisms and Color-Lorentz Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum current density (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the color-Lorentz force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly (a ``negative pressure'' potential). From the state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and the color-Lorentz forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a heavy-quark confinement potential.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of a number of proton-rich isotopes in the solar system has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. While recent studies have analyzed several relevant physical effects that influence the efficiency of this process, the impact of General Relativity (GR) on it remains unexplored. We perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated $\nu p$-process yields in Newtonian and fully GR calculations, using detailed models of time-evolving outflow profiles. The GR effects are seen to suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the resulting $p$-nuclide abundances. Our reference GR model, with an 18~$M_\odot$ progenitor, reproduces both the relative and absolute solar system abundances of the entire set of the $p$ nuclides in the mass range $74\leq A\leq102$. The yields are suboptimal in our 12.75~$M_\odot$ GR model, where the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, suppressing further $p$-nuclide production. In both models, most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes occurs relatively early, 1--3 seconds after shock revival. In contrast, a large fraction of the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$ is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In summary, with the GR effects taken into account, the $\nu p$-process in a sufficiently massive progenitor can provide a unifying explanation for the origin of all $p$ nuclei in the solar system up to $^{102}$Pd.</description>

      <title>A Journey of Seeking Pressure and Forces in the Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ is a general physics concept describing the momentum conservation through momentum flow generated from both the kinetic motion of particles and the interacting forces among them. It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the MCD in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear forces between adjacent parts of the system because the nucleon interior approximates a continuous medium. While intuitively appealing, we find that the interpretation is hard to justify from a detailed examination of the physical mechanisms for the momentum flow in QCD. After reviewing through a broad range of classical and quantum systems, we find that while thermal and/or quantum average of isotropic motion contributes to kinetic MCD a pressure term proportional to $\delta^{ij}$, when there is an anisotropic motion, the pressure cannot simply be identified from the MCD tensor. Furthermore, kinetic pressure cannot be considered as the surface force between adjacent parts of a system. More importantly, at the scale of the nucleon dimension, the color forces among quarks and gluons is by no means short-ranged as in a continuous medium, and the resulting interaction MCD cannot be interpreted as normal or shear ``stress'' force, although an isotropic term from the QCD trace anomaly may be interpreted as a ``vacuum pressure.'' Following our previous study of force densities through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the vacuum pressure term provides a confining potential on the quarks through color Lorentz forces.</description>

      <title>Does the suppression shown at LHC in O-O collisions follow the systematics obtained for A-A collisions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present to what extent recent experimental results obtained for $\pi^{0}$ suppression in O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.36 TeV fit into the systematics for much heavier systems. The systematics with which the comparison is made was published a few years ago \cite{Pet_1} in terms of charged particles suppression $R_{AA}$ as a function of $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ and $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$. The values of $R_{AA}$ at $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$ and $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ experimentally measured and estimated by Glauber MC, respectively, for O-O collisions
  are in good agreement with the systematics obtained for
  A-A collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>
