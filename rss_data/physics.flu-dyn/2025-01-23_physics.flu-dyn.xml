      <title>Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Relaxation Strategies to Support Numerical Stability of Segregated Continuous Adjoint Flow Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for numerically stabilizing sequential continuous adjoint flow solvers utilizing an elliptic relaxation strategy. The proposed approach is formulated as a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) containing a single user-defined parameter, which analytical investigations reveal to represent the filter width of a probabilistic density function or Gaussian kernel. Key properties of the approach include (a) smoothing features with redistribution capabilities while (b) preserving integral properties. The technique targets explicit adjoint cross-coupling terms, such as the Adjoint Transpose Convection (ATC) term, which frequently causes numerical instabilities, especially on unstructured grids common in industrial applications. A trade-off is made by sacrificing sensitivity consistency to achieve enhanced numerical robustness.
  The method is validated on a two-phase, laminar, two-dimensional cylinder flow test case at Re=20 and Fn=0.75, focusing on minimizing resistance or maximizing lift. A range of homogeneous and inhomogeneous filter widths is evaluated. Subsequently, the relaxation method is employed to stabilize adjoint simulations during shape optimizations that aim at drag reduction of ship hulls. Two case studies are considered: A model-scale bulk carrier traveling at Re=7.246E+06 and Fn=0.142 as well as a harbor ferry cruising at Re=2.43E+08 and Fn=0.4 in full-scale conditions. Both cases, characterized by unstructured grids prone to adjoint divergence, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in overcoming stability challenges. The resulting optimizations achieve superior outcomes compared to approaches that omit problematic coupling terms.</description>

      <title>An Implicit Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator for Long-term Predictions of Three-dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term prediction of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning approaches. Although some existing machine learning approaches such as implicit U-net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) have been proven to be capable of achieving stable long-term predictions for turbulent flows, their computational costs are usually high. In this paper, we extend the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO) from two-dimensional space to 3D space. Furthermore, we employ the implicit iteration to the AFNO and propose the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO). IAFNO is systematically tested in three types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. The numerical results demonstrate that IAFNO is more accurate and stable than IUFNO and the traditional large-eddy simulation using dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). Meanwhile, the AFNO model exhibits instability in numerical simulations. Moreover, the training efficiency of IAFNO is 4 times higher than that of IUFNO, and the number of parameters and GPU memory occupation of IAFNO are only 1/80 and 1/3 of IUFNO, respectively in HIT. In other tests, the improvements are slightly lower but still considerable. These improvements mainly come from patching and self-attention in 3D space. Besides, the well-trained IAFNO is significantly faster than the DSM.</description>

      <title>Impact of saturation on evaporation-driven density instabilities in porous media: mathematical and numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation from a porous medium partially saturated with saline water, causes the salinity (salt concentration) to increase near the top of the porous medium as water leaves while salt stays behind. As the density of the water increases with increased salt concentration, the evaporation leads to a gravitational unstable setting, where density instabilities can form. Whether density instabilities form, depends on a large range of parameters like the evaporation rate and intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, but also on the water saturation. As water saturation decreases, the storage, convection and diffusion of salt also decrease, which all influence the onset of instabilities. By performing a linear stability analysis on the governing equations, we give criteria for onset of instabilities. Numerical simulations give information about the further development of these instabilities. With this knowledge we can predict whether and when density instabilities occur, and how they will influence the further development of salt concentration in the porous medium.</description>

      <title>Local slip length and surfactant effects on liquid-infused surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust surfaces capable of reducing flow drag, controlling heat and mass transfer, and resisting fouling in fluid flows are important for various applications. In this context, textured surfaces impregnated with a liquid lubricant show promise due to their ability to sustain a liquid-liquid layer that induces slippage. However, theoretical and numerical studies suggest that the slippage can be compromised by surfactants in the overlying fluid, which contaminate the liquid-liquid interface and generate Marangoni stresses. In this study, we use Doppler-optical coherence tomography, an interferometric imaging technique, combined with numerical simulations to investigate how surfactants influence the slip length of lubricant-infused surfaces with longitudinal grooves in a laminar flow. We introduce surfactants by adding tracer particles (milk) to the working fluid (water). Local measurements of slip length at the liquid-liquid interface are significantly smaller than theoretical predictions for clean interfaces (Sch\"onecker &amp; Hardt 2013). In contrast, measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of fully immobilized interfaces, indicating that milk particles adsorbed at the interface are responsible for the reduction in slippage. This work provides the first experimental evidence that liquid-liquid interfaces within textured surfaces can become immobilized in the presence of surfactants and flow.</description>

      <title>Global potential energy coupled $k$-$\varepsilon$ RANS model for natural convection flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new buoyancy-correction approach for the $\varepsilon$-equation in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling is introduced, derived from a general algebraic function that incorporates available potential energy as an additional global parameter. A key limitation of conventional two-equation RANS models is the absence of a clear standard for incorporating buoyancy effects in their scale-determining equations (e.g., the $\varepsilon$-equation). This study proposes addressing this gap by using Rayleigh--B\'enard (RB) convection as a baseline problem to guide the model formulation. An equilibrium analysis, yielding an analytic solution for RB convection, confirms that the proposed model can reproduce similarity relations not captured by conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number dependencies over wide ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Using a set of modeling constants optimized for RB convection, the proposed model is further tested on two types of internally heated convection, demonstrating marked improvements over existing models. The method remains fully compatible with conventional RANS frameworks and naturally reverts to conventional turbulence treatments in shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a single, algebraic global function in front of the buoyancy-related term in the conventional $\varepsilon$-equation, this approach is expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Can aerodynamic noise from large offshore wind turbines affect marine life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pressing demand for offshore wind energy has driven a significant increase in the size of wind turbines, as exemplified by the proposed 22MW turbine in the IEA Task 55 REFWIND. In addition, today it is common to see offshore farms with 100 or 150 turbines. The combination of turbines of increasing sizes in populated farms facilitates energy production but can lead to non-negligible aerodynamic noise emissions, which can be heard underwater. This paper quantifies the underwater aerodynamic noise footprint of three large offshore turbines (5MW, 10MW, and 22MW) and farms composed of these types of turbines. By comparing the underwater noise spectra with audiograms of marine animals, we confirm that the noise emissions of large offshore farms will soon pose an environmental problem. The proposed methodology allows wind turbine designers to predict and mitigate the impact of noise while promoting sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>Ensemble score filter with image inpainting for data assimilation in tracking surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics with partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting turbulent systems within geoscience and weather forecasting, where data assimilation is used to address three fundamental challenges, i.e., high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and partial observations. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated encouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF) that integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with partial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed training-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data assimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in the context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are directly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a covariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved state variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the partial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image inpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during data assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to estimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the score function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved state variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by tracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of scenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth investigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data assimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting problems.</description>

      <title>Conservative, pressure-equilibrium-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for compressible, multicomponent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns preservation of velocity and pressure equilibria in smooth, compressible, multicomponent flows in the inviscid limit. First, we derive the velocity-equilibrium and pressure-equilibrium conditions of a standard discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the conservative form of the compressible, multicomponent Euler equations. We show that under certain constraints on the numerical flux, the scheme is velocity-equilibrium-preserving. However, standard discontinuous Galerkin schemes are not pressure-equilibrium-preserving. Therefore, we introduce a discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the pressure-evolution equation in place of the total-energy conservation equation. Semidiscrete conservation of total energy, which would otherwise be lost, is restored via the correction terms of [Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys., 372, 2018, pp. 640-666] and [Abgrall et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453, 2022, 110955]. Since the addition of the correction terms prevents exact preservation of pressure and velocity equilibria, we propose modifications that then lead to a velocity-equilibrium-preserving, pressure-equilibrium-preserving, and (semidiscretely) energy-conservative discontinuous Galerkin scheme, although there are certain tradeoffs. Additional extensions are also introduced. We apply the developed scheme to smooth, interfacial flows involving mixtures of thermally perfect gases initially in pressure and velocity equilibria to demonstrate its performance in one, two, and three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Orientation instability of settling spheroids in a linearly density stratified fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much work has been done to understand the settling dynamics of spherical particles in a homogeneous and a stratified fluid. However, the effects of shape anisotropy on the settling dynamics of a particle in a stratified fluid are not completely understood. To this end, we perform numerical simulations for settling oblate and prolate spheroids in a stratified fluid. We present the results for the Reynolds number, $Re$, in the range $80-250$ and the Richardson number, $Ri$, in the range $0-10$. We find that both the oblate and prolate spheroids reorient to the edge-wise and partially edge-wise orientations, respectively, as they settle in a stratified fluid completely different from the steady-state broad-side on orientation observed in a homogeneous fluid. We observe that reorientation instabilities emerge when the velocity magnitude of the spheroids fall below a particular threshold. We also report the enhancement of the drag on the particle from stratification. The torque due to buoyancy effects tries to orient the spheroid in an edge-wise orientation while the hydrodynamic torque tries to orient it to a broad-side on orientation. Below the velocity threshold, the buoyancy torque dominates; resulting in the onset of reorientation instability. Finally, the asymmetry in the distribution of the baroclinic vorticity generation term around the spheroids explains the onset of the reorientation instability.</description>

      <title>Rheology of concentrated suspension of fibers with load dependent friction coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian calibration of bubble size dynamics applied to CO2 gas fermenters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in class methods for population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.</description>

      <title>Glacierware: Hotspot-aware Microfluidic Cooling for High TDP Chips using Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous increase in computational power of GPUs, essential for advancements in areas like artificial intelligence and data processing, is driving the adoption of liquid cooling in data centers. Skived copper cold plates featuring parallel straight channels are a mature technology, but they lack design freedom due to manufacturing limitations. As chips become increasingly complex in their design with the transition towards heterogeneous integration, these parallel straight channels are not able to address critical areas of concentrated high heat flux (hotspots) on a chip. A single hotspot exceeding the upper temperature limit can cause the full chip to throttle and hence limit performance. In addition, this would require a reduction in coolant inlet temperature in the data center, causing an increase in electricity and water consumption. Ideally, areas of the cold plate in contact with hotspots of the chip need smaller channels to increase convective heat transfer, whereas areas with low heat flux may benefit from larger channels to compensate for the increased pressure drop. However, manual optimization of such a cooling design is challenging due to the nonlinearity of the problem. In this paper, we explore the usage of topology optimization as a method to tailor microfluidic cooling design to the power distribution of a chip to address the hotspot temperatures in high-power chips, using a platform called Glacierware. We compare the hotspot-aware, topology-optimized microfluidic design to straight channels of various widths to benchmark its performance. Evaluations of this optimized design show a 13% lower temperature rise or a 55% lower pressure than the best-performing straight channels, indicating highly competitive performance in industrial settings where both pressure and flow rate are constrained.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fluid-solid interaction of suspensions of Kolmogorov-size spherical particles moving in homogeneous isotropic turbulence at a microscale Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 140$. Two volume fractions are considered, $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, and the solid-to-fluid density ratio is set to $5$ and $100$. We present a comparison between interface-resolved (PR-DNS) and one-way-coupled point-particle (PP-DNS) direct numerical simulations. We find that the modulated energy spectrum shows the classical $-5/3$ Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range of scales and a $-4$ scaling at smaller scales, with the latter resulting from a balance between the energy injected by the particles and the viscous dissipation, in an otherwise smooth flow. An analysis of the small-scale flow topology shows that the particles mainly favour events with axial strain and vortex compression. The dynamics of the particles and their collective motion studied for PR-DNS are used to assess the validity of the PP-DNS. We find that the PP-DNS predicts fairly well both the Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics of the particles motion for the low-density case, while some discrepancies are observed for the high-density case. Also, the PP-DNS is found to underpredict the level of clustering of the suspension compared to the PR-DNS, with a larger difference for the high-density case.</description>

      <title>Using lateral dispersion to optimise microfluidic trap array efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microfluidic trapping arrays have proven to be efficient tools for various applications that require working at the single-cell level, such as cell-cell communication or fusion. Although several hydrodynamic trapping devices have already been optimised, two-dimensional (2D) single-layer trapping arrays with high trap densities remain partially inefficient. Specifically, many traps remain empty, even after prolonged injection, which drastically reduces the number of samples available for post-treatment. These unfilled traps result from the symmetrical nature of the flow around the traps, and breaking this symmetry enhances capture efficiency. In this study, we use a numerical approachto show that optimal geometries can significantly increase filling efficiency and a preliminary experimental test confirming our approach is provided. We show that these improvements are achieved by promoting lateral dispersion of particles, facilitated either through an optimised oblique flow or by introducing disorder into the spatial arrangement of traps without specific inlet/outlet adjustment.</description>

      <title>Influence of initial conditions on data-driven model identification and information entropy for ideal mhd problems</title>

Abstract: Data-driven methods of model identification are able to discern governing dynamics of a system from data. Such methods are well suited to help us learn about systems with unpredictable evolution or systems with ambiguous governing dynamics given our current understanding. Many plasma problems of interest fall into these categories as there are a wide range of models that exist, however each model is only useful in a certain regime and often limited by computational complexity. To ensure data-driven methods align with theory, they must be consistent and predictable when acting on data whose governing dynamics are known. Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) is a recently developed data-driven method that has shown promise in learning governing dynamics from data with high noise levels [1]. This work examines how WSINDy acts on ideal MHD test problems as the initial conditions are varied and specifies limiting requirements for successful equation identification. It is hard to recover the governing dynamics from data that emphasize a single dominant behavior. In these low information cases, Shannon information entropy is able to pick up on the redundancies in the data that affect recoverability.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>

Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent application in the derivation of stochastic transport models for fluids dynamics. In this work, we first construct the Lagrange-to-Euler map of an ideal fluid flow, modelled by a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism, as the deterministic homogenized limit of a parameterized flow map that decomposes into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove the convergence of this parameterized map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak-invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component becomes a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism that can introduce stochastic transport into the dynamics of the slow component, which remains to be closed.
  The second contribution of this work formulates two distinct types of variational closures for the slow component of the homogenized flow whilst utilising the composite structure of the full stochastic flow. In one case, the critical points of the new principle satisfy a system of random partial differential equations equivalent to a system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) under stochastic transport via a transformation by the stochastic flow. Additionally, we show these equations are stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). In the other case, we modify the assumptions on the slow component of composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work such as Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) and Lagrangian Average Euler Poincar\'e (LAEP).</description>

      <title>Community attitudes towards the environmental cost of computational fluid dynamics research</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations underpin much fluid dynamics research today. Such simulations often rely on large scale high performance computing (HPC) systems, and have a significant carbon footprint. Increasing the efficiency of data centers or the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources can lessen the environmental impact of scientific computing to a degree, but the attitudes of researchers also play a role. There are many choices researchers make which influence the carbon footprint of simulations. To change behaviours around simulation use, it is first necessary to understand attitudes toward them. Here, we present a case study on fluid dynamics researchers based in the University of Manchester, UK. We find a low awareness of the carbon footprint of computations, compounded by a lack of knowledge of the specific hardware used to run simulations. There is a discrepancy between researchers self-declared attitudes towards reducing the carbon footprint of their work, and their actions and choices. Overall, researchers did not consider carbon footprint as important in their decision making, and we found no correlation between the impact and carbon cost of simulations. Improved education and awareness of the environmental impact of simulations is imperative in the interests of the sustainability of this field.</description>
