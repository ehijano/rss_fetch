      <title>Algebra of Invariants for the Vlasov-Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebra of invariants for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic multispecies Vlasov-Maxwell system is examined, including the case with a fixed ion background. Invariants and their associated fluxes are obtained directly from the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The invariants are shown to Poisson commute with the Hamiltonian and the rest of the Poisson bracket algebra of invariants is identified. Special attention is given to the role played by the monopole condition, $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}$.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50\% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>X-ray free-electron lasing in a flying-focus undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven free-electron lasers (LDFELs) replace magnetostatic undulators with the electromagnetic fields of a laser pulse. Because the undulator period is half the wavelength of the laser pulse, LDFELs can amplify x rays using lower electron energies and over shorter interaction lengths than a traditional free-electron laser. In LDFELs driven by conventional laser pulses, the undulator uniformity required for high gain necessitates large laser-pulse energies. Here, we show that a flying-focus pulse provides the undulator uniformity required to reach high gain with a substantially lower energy than a conventional pulse. The flying-focus pulse features an intensity peak that travels in the opposite direction of its phase fronts. This enables an LDFEL configuration where an electron beam collides head-on with the phase fronts and experiences a near-constant undulator strength as it co-propagates with the intensity peak. Three-dimensional simulations of this configuration demonstrate the generation of megawatts of coherent x-ray radiation with 20 times less energy than a conventional laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Robustness Optimization for Compact Free-electron Laser Driven by Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the shot-to-shot fluctuations inherent to LWFAs remain a major obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with high gain and robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with enhanced robustness and reliability. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 microjoule at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, and yet, a means to carefully control the decay of compressible modes in these systems has largely been neglected. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of the compressible modes, we perform supersonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. For $10^{-3} \leq \rm{P}\nu \leq \infty$, we explore a broad range of statistics critical to the dynamo problem. We derive a general framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that compressible modes play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in supersonic dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), compressible modes pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. As $\rm{P}\nu$ decreases, compressible modes are dissipated at increasingly larger scales, in turn suppressing incompressible modes through a coupling between viscosity operators. We emphasise the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas and direct numerical simulations that include compressibility.</description>

      <title>First-principles measurement of ion and electron energization in collisionless accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the largest 3D Particle-in-Cell shearing-box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability, for the first time employing the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio. We investigate the energy partition between relativistically hot electrons and subrelativistic ions in turbulent accretion flows, a regime relevant to collisionless, radiatively inefficient accretion flows of supermassive black holes, such as those targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope. We provide a simple empirical formula to describe the measured heating ratio between ions and electrons, which can be used for more accurate global modeling of accretion flows with standard fluid approaches such as general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.</description>
