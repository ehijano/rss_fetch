      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ad-hoc networks are specifically designed to facilitate communication in environments where establishing a dedicated network infrastructure is exceedingly complex or impractical. The integration of clustering concepts into various ad-hoc network scenarios, including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET), Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET), Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN), Wireless Ad-hoc Networks (WANET), Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks (UAV), commonly known as "drones," Space Networks (SN), and Satellite Networks (TN), presents abundant opportunities for refining strategies in event tracking and area monitoring across both deterministic and uncertain environments. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of diverse proposed strategies leveraging clustering concepts to address coverage challenges within deterministic and uncertain environments. As a result, it addresses current and future challenges inherent in clustering-based WANET, elucidating the merits, shortcomings, and weaknesses of clustering models. Lastly, it identifies potential avenues for addressing coverage issues in existing and emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Network Deployment on the Performance of NCR-assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the need of coverage enhancement in the fifth generation (5G) of wireless cellular telecommunications, while taking into account possible bottlenecks related to deploying fiber based backhaul (e.g., required cost and time), the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) proposed in Release 18 the concept of network-controlled repeaters (NCRs). NCRs enhance previous radio frequency (RF) repeaters by exploring beamforming transmissions controlled by the network through side control information. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of NCR. Furthermore, we present a system level model that allows the performance evaluation of an NCR-assisted network. Finally, we evaluate the network deployment impact on the performance of NCR-assisted networks. As we show, with proper network planning, NCRs can boost the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the user equipments (UEs) in a poor coverage of a macro base station. Furthermore, celledge UEs and uplink (UL) communications are the ones that benefit the most from the presence of NCRs.</description>

      <title>Optimization of End-to-End AoI in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Fog Systems: A Dueling-DQN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-time status update services for the Internet of Things (IoT), the timely dissemination of information requiring timely updates is crucial to maintaining its relevance. Failing to keep up with these updates results in outdated information. The age of information (AoI) serves as a metric to quantify the freshness of information. The Existing works to optimize AoI primarily focus on the transmission time from the information source to the monitor, neglecting the transmission time from the monitor to the destination. This oversight significantly impacts information freshness and subsequently affects decision-making accuracy. To address this gap, we designed an edge-enabled vehicular fog system to lighten the computational burden on IoT devices. We examined how information transmission and request-response times influence end-to-end AoI. As a solution, we proposed Dueling-Deep Queue Network (dueling-DQN), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm and compared its performance with DQN policy and analytical results. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dueling-DQN algorithm outperforms both DQN and analytical methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving real-time system information freshness. Considering the complete end-to-end transmission process, our optimization approach can improve decision-making performance and overall system efficiency.</description>

      <title>FedPot: A Quality-Aware Collaborative and Incentivized Honeypot-Based Detector for Smart Grid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeypot technologies provide an effective defense strategy for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), particularly in enhancing the Advanced Metering Infrastructure's (AMI) security by bolstering the network intrusion detection system. For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Reactive Routing Protocol for Decentralized UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks consisting of low SWaP, FW-UAVs are used in many applications, such as monitoring, search and surveillance of inaccessible areas. A decentralized and autonomous approach ensures robustness to failures; the UAVs explore and sense within the area and forward their information, in a multihop manner, to nearby aerial gateway nodes. However, the unpredictable nature of the events, relatively high speed of UAVs, and dynamic UAV trajectories cause the network topology to change significantly over time, resulting in frequent route breaks. A holistic routing approach is needed to support multiple traffic flows in these networks to provide mobility- and congestion-aware, high-quality routes when needed, with low control and computational overheads, using the information collected in a distributed manner. Existing routing schemes do not address all the mentioned issues.
  We present a hybrid reactive routing protocol for decentralized UAV networks. Our scheme searches routes on-demand, monitors a region around the selected route (the pipe), and proactively switches to an alternative route before the current route's quality degrades below a threshold. We empirically evaluate the impact of pipe width and node density on our ability to find alternate high-quality routes within the pipe and the overhead required to maintain the pipe. Compared to existing reactive routing schemes, our approach achieves higher throughput and reduces the number of route discoveries, overhead, and resulting flow interruptions at different traffic loads, node densities and speeds. Despite having limited network topology information, and low overhead and route computation complexity, our proposed scheme achieves superior throughput to proactive optimized link state routing scheme at different network and traffic settings. We also evaluate the relative performance of reactive and proactive routing schemes.</description>

      <title>xApp Distillation: AI-based Conflict Mitigation in B5G O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements of machine learning-based (ML) decision-making algorithms created various research and industrial opportunities. One of these areas is ML-based near-real-time network management applications (xApps) in Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Normally, xApps are designed solely for the desired objectives, and fine-tuned for deployment. However, telecommunication companies can employ multiple xApps and deploy them in overlapping areas. Consider the different design objectives of xApps, the deployment might cause conflicts. To prevent such conflicts, we proposed the xApp distillation method that distills knowledge from multiple xApps, then uses this knowledge to train a single model that has retained the capabilities of Previous xApps. Performance evaluations show that compared conflict mitigation schemes can cause up to six times more network outages than xApp distillation in some cases.</description>

      <title>Science DMZ Networks: How Different are They Really?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ) is a network environment optimized for scientific applications. A Science DMZ provides an environment mostly free from competing traffic flows and complex security middleware such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems that often impede data transfer performance. The Science DMZ model provides a reference set of network design patterns, tuned hosts and protocol stacks dedicated to large data transfers and streamlined security postures that significantly improve data transfer performance, accelerating scientific collaborations and discovery.
  Over the past decade, many universities and organizations have adopted this model for their research computing. Despite becoming increasingly popular, there is a lack of quantitative studies comparing such a specialized network to conventional production networks regarding network characteristics and data transfer performance. We strive to answer the following research questions in this study: Does a Science DMZ exhibit significantly different behavior than a general-purpose campus network? Does it improve application performance compared to such general-purpose networks? Through a two-year-long quantitative network measurement study, we find that a Science DMZ exhibits lower latency, higher throughput, and lower jitter behaviors. However, we also see several non-intuitive results. For example, a DMZ may take a longer route to external destinations and experience higher latency than the campus network. While the DMZ model benefits researchers, the benefits are not automatic - careful network tuning based on specific use cases is required to realize the full potential of such infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automotive User Experience with Dynamic Service Orchestration for Software Defined Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for dynamic behaviors in automotive use cases, Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) have emerged as a promising solution by bringing dynamic onboard service management capabilities. While users may request a wide range of services during vehicle operation, background tasks such as cooperative Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services can activate on-the-fly in response to real-time road conditions. In this dynamic environment, the efficient allocation of onboard resources becomes a complex challenge, in order to meet mixed-criticality onboard Quality-of-Service (QoS) network requirements while ensuring an optimal user experience. Additionally, the ever-evolving real-time network connectivity and computational availability conditions further complicate the process. In this context, we present a dynamic resource-based onboard service orchestration algorithm that considers real-time in-vehicle and V2X network health, along with onboard resource constraints, to select degraded modes for onboard applications and maximize user experience. To enable dynamic orchestration, we introduce the concept of Automotive eXperience Integrity Level (AXIL) which expresses a runtime priority for non-safety-critical applications. This algorithm produces near-optimal solutions while significantly reducing execution time compared to straightforward methods as demonstrated by simulation results. With this approach, we aim to enable efficient onboard execution for a user experience-focused service orchestration.</description>

      <title>Navigating Connected Car Cybersecurity: Location Anomaly Detection with RAN Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cybersecurity of connected cars, integral to the broader Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, has become of paramount concern. Cyber-attacks, including hijacking and spoofing, pose significant threats to these technological advancements, potentially leading to unauthorized control over vehicular networks or creating deceptive identities. Given the difficulty of deploying comprehensive defensive logic across all vehicles, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying potential attacks through Radio Access Network (RAN) event monitoring. The major contribution of this paper is a location anomaly detection module that identifies aberrant devices that appear in multiple locations simultaneously - a potential indicator of a hijacking attack. We demonstrate how RAN-event based location anomaly detection is effective in combating malicious activity targeting connected cars. Using RAN data generated by tens of millions of connected cars, we developed a fast and efficient method for identifying potential malicious or rogue devices. The implications of this research are far-reaching. By increasing the security of connected cars, we can enhance the safety of users, provide robust defenses for the automotive industry, and improve overall cybersecurity practices for IoT devices.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of ROS2 Middlewares for Multi-robot Mesh Networks in Planetary Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) and mesh network technologies pave the way for innovative approaches to explore extreme environments. The Artemis Accords, a series of international agreements, have further catalyzed this progress by fostering cooperation in space exploration, emphasizing the use of cutting-edge technologies. In parallel, the widespread adoption of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) by companies across various sectors underscores its robustness and versatility. This paper evaluates the performances of available ROS 2 MiddleWare (RMW), such as FastRTPS, CycloneDDS and Zenoh, over a mesh network with a dynamic topology. The final choice of RMW is determined by the one that would fit the most the scenario: an exploration of the extreme extra-terrestrial environment using a MRS. The conducted study in a real environment highlights Zenoh as a potential solution for future applications, showing a reduced delay, reachability, and CPU usage while being competitive on data overhead and RAM usage over a dynamic mesh topology</description>

      <title>Streaming Large-Scale Electron Microscopy Data to a Supercomputing Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data management is a critical component of modern experimental workflows. As data generation rates increase, transferring data from acquisition servers to processing servers via conventional file-based methods is becoming increasingly impractical. The 4D Camera at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) generates data at a nominal rate of 480 Gbit/s (87,000 frames/s) producing a 700 GB dataset in fifteen seconds. To address the challenges associated with storing and processing such quantities of data, we developed a streaming workflow that utilizes a high-speed network to connect the 4D Camera's data acquisition (DAQ) system to supercomputing nodes at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), bypassing intermediate file storage entirely. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our streaming pipeline in a production setting through an hour-long experiment that generated over 10 TB of raw data, yielding high-quality datasets suitable for advanced analyses. Additionally, we compare the efficacy of this streaming workflow against the conventional file-transfer workflow by conducting a post-mortem analysis on historical data from experiments performed by real users. Our findings show that the streaming workflow significantly improves data turnaround time, enables real-time decision-making, and minimizes the potential for human error by eliminating manual user interactions.</description>

      <title>HexRAN: A Programmable Approach to Open RAN Base Station System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the radio access network (RAN) domain has witnessed a sea change with increasing levels of virtualization and softwarization driven by emerging paradigms such as the Open RAN (O-RAN) movement. However, the fundamental building block of the cellular network, i.e., the base station, remains unchanged and ill-equipped to handle this architectural evolution. In particular, with reference to existing base station architectures, there exists a general lack of programmability and composability along with a protocol stack that grapples with diverging and often conflicting requirements set forth by 3GPP and O-RAN. Recognizing the need for an "O-RAN-native" approach to base station design, this paper introduces HexRAN- a novel base station architecture characterized by key features relating to RAN disaggregation and composability, 3GPP and O-RAN protocol integration and programmability, robust controller interactions, and customizable RAN slicing. Furthermore, the paper also includes a concrete systems-level prototype and comprehensive experimental evaluation of HexRAN on an over-the-air testbed, showcasing the scalability and performance benefits associated with the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>DNFS-VNE: Deep Neuro Fuzzy System Driven Virtual Network Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By decoupling substrate resources, network virtualization (NV) is a promising solution for meeting diverse demands and ensuring differentiated quality of service (QoS). In particular, virtual network embedding (VNE) is a critical enabling technology that enhances the flexibility and scalability of network deployment by addressing the coupling of Internet processes and services. However, in the existing deep neural networks (DNNs)-based works, the black-box nature DNNs limits the analysis, development, and improvement of systems. For example, in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a conflict between decision interpretability and the opacity of DNN-based methods. In recent times, interpretable deep learning (DL) represented by deep neuro fuzzy systems (DNFS) combined with fuzzy inference has shown promising interpretability to further exploit the hidden value in the data. Motivated by this, we propose a DNFS-based VNE algorithm that aims to provide an interpretable NV scheme. Specifically, data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as fuzzy implication operators to compute the embedding probabilities of candidate substrate nodes through entailment operations. And, the identified fuzzy rule patterns are cached into the weights by forward computation and gradient back-propagation (BP). Moreover, the fuzzy rule base is constructed based on Mamdani-type linguistic rules using linguistic labels. In addition, the DNFS-driven five-block structure-based policy network serves as the agent for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which optimizes VNE decision-making through interaction with the environment. Finally, the effectiveness of evaluation indicators and fuzzy rules is verified by simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: Terrestrial networks form the fundamental infrastructure of modern communication systems, serving more than 4 billion users globally. However, terrestrial networks are facing a wide range of challenges, from coverage and reliability to interference and congestion. As the demands of the 6G era are expected to be much higher, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for the future. To address these problems, Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) has emerged to be a promising solution. NTNs are communication networks that leverage airborne (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) and spaceborne vehicles (e.g., satellites) to facilitate ultra-reliable communications and connectivity with high data rates and low latency over expansive regions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the utilization of network slicing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) to address diverse challenges of NTNs from the perspectives of both academia and industry. Particularly, we first provide an in-depth tutorial on NTN and the key enabling technologies including network slicing, AI/ML, and ORAN. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on how network slicing and AI/ML have been leveraged to overcome the challenges that NTNs are facing. Moreover, we present how ORAN can be utilized for NTNs. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of NTN in the 6G era.</description>

      <title>The Gossiping Insert-Eliminate Algorithm for Multi-Agent Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret. In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is gradually becoming a reality due to the significant increase in frequency and bandwidth of next-generation wireless communication technologies. Therefore it becomes crucial to evaluate the communication and sensing performance using appropriate channel models to address resource competition from each other. Existing work only models the sensing capability based on the mutual information between the channel response and the received signal, and its theoretical resolution is difficult to support the high-precision requirements of ISAC for sensing tasks, and may even affect its communication optimal.
  In this paper, we propose a sensing channel encoder model to measure the sensing capacity with higher resolution by discrete task mutual information. For the first time, derive upper and lower bounds on the sensing accuracy for a given channel. This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the ISAC systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>
