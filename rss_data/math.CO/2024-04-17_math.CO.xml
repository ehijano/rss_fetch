      <title>Koszulity, supersolvability, and Stirling representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>The sandwich problem for odd-hole-free and even-hole-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a property $\mathcal{P}$ of graphs, the $\mathcal{P}$-\textsc{Sandwich-Problem}, introduced by Golumbic and Shamir (1993), is the following: Given a pair of graphs $(G_1, G_2)$ on the same vertex set $V$, does there exist a graph $G$ such that $V(G)=V$, $E(G_{1})\subseteq E(G) \subseteq E(G_{2})$, and $G$ satisfies $\mathcal{P}$? A {\em hole} in a graph is an induced subgraph which is a cycle of length at least four. An odd (respectively even) hole is a hole of odd (respectively even) length. Given a class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$ and a graph $G$ we say that $G$ is {\em $\mathcal{C}$-free} if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper we prove that if $\mathcal{P}$ is the property of being odd-hole-free or the property of being even-hole-free, then the $\mathcal{P}$-\textsc{Sandwich-Problem} is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Limit points of $A_{\alpha}$-matrices of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study limit points of the spectral radii of $A_{\alpha}$-matrices of graphs. Adapting a method used by J. B. Shearer in 1989, we prove a density property of $A_{\alpha}$-limit points of caterpillars for $\alpha$ close to zero. Precisely, we show that for $\alpha \in [0, 1/2)$ there exists a positive number $\tau_2(\alpha)&gt;2$ such that any value $\lambda&gt; \tau_2(\alpha)$ is an $A_{\alpha}$-limit point. We also determine the existence of other intervals for which all its points are $A_{\alpha}$-limit points.</description>

      <title>Eulerian $k$-dominating reconfiguration graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the vertices of the $k$-dominating graph, denoted $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$, correspond to the dominating sets of $G$ with cardinality at most $k$. Two vertices of $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding dominating sets in $G$ can be obtained from one other by adding or removing a single vertex of $G$. Since $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is not necessarily connected when $k &lt; |V(G)|$, much research has focused on conditions under which $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is connected and recent work has explored the existence of Hamilton paths in the $k$-dominating graph. We consider the complementary problem of determining the conditions under which the $k$-dominating graph is Eulerian. In the case where $k = |V(G)|$, we characterize those graphs $G$ for which $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is Eulerian. In the case where $k$ is restricted, we determine for a number of graph classes, the conditions under which the $k$-dominating graph is Eulerian.</description>

      <title>Forbidden subgraphs generating a finite set of graphs with minimum degree three and large girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, a graph $G$ is said to be {\it $\mathcal{H}$-free} if $G$ contains no member of $\mathcal{H}$ as an induced subgraph. We let $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_{3}(\mathcal{H})$ denote the family of connected $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs having minimum degree at least $3$. In this paper, we characterize the non-caterpillar trees $T$ having diameter at least $7$ such that $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_{3}(\{C_{3},C_{4},T\})$ is a finite family, where $C_{n}$ is a cycle of order $n$.</description>

      <title>The total chord length of maximal outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider embeddings of maximal outerplanar graphs whose vertices all lie on a cycle $\mathcal{C}$ bounding a face. Each edge of the graph that is not in $\mathcal{C}$, a chord, is assigned a length equal to the length of the shortest path in $\mathcal{C}$ between its endpoints. We define the total chord length of a graph as the sum of lengths of all its chords. For each order $n\ge 5$, we find outerplanar graphs whose total chord length is minimal among all graphs of the same order, and graphs whose total chord length is maximal among all graphs of the same order. We give a complete characterization of those graphs whose total chord length is maximal. We show that every integer value in the interval determined by the minimum and maximum values is the total chord length of a maximal outerplanar graph of the same order.</description>

      <title>An improved upper bound for planar Tur\'an number of double star $S_{2,5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Tur\'{a}n number of a graph $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. Recently, D. Ghosh, et al. initiated the topic of double stars and prove that $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,S_{2,5})\leq \frac{20}{7}n$. In this paper, we continue to study this and give a sharp upper bound $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,S_{2,5})\leq \frac{19}{7}n-\frac{18}{7}$ for all $n\geq 1$, with equality when $n=12$. This improves Ghosh's result.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional grid-imprimitive block-transitive designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown in 1989 by Delandtsheer and Doyen that, for a $2$-design with $v$ points and block size $k$, a block-transitive group of automorphisms can be point-imprimitive (that is, leave invariant a nontrivial partition of the point set) only if $v$ is small enough relative to $k$. Recently, exploiting a construction of block-transitive point-imprimitive $2$-designs given by Cameron and the last author, four of the authors studied $2$-designs admitting a block-transitive group that preserves a two-dimensional grid structure on the point set. Here we consider the case where there a block-transitive group preserves a multidimensional grid structure on points. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for such $2$-designs to exist in terms of the parameters of the grid, and certain `array parameters' which describe a subset of points (which will be a block of the design). Using this criterion, we construct explicit examples of $2$-designs for grids of dimensions three and four, and pose several open questions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ma, Qian and Shi determined the maximum size of an $n$-vertex graph with given fractional matching number $s$ and maximum degree at most $d$. Motivated by this result, we determine the maximum number of $\ell$-cliques in a graph with given fractional matching number and minimum degree, which generalizes Shi and Ma's result about the maximum size of a graph with given fractional matching number and minimum degree at least one. We also determine the maximum number of complete bipartite graphs in a graph with prescribed fractional matching number and minimum degree.</description>

      <title>On the number of subsequence sums of a sequence in finite abelian groups related to the support of the sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $S$ a sequence with elements of $G$. Let $|S|$ denote the length of $S$ and $k$ an integer with $k\in [1, |S|]$. Let $\Sigma_{k}(S) \subset G$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a subsequence of $S$ with length $k$. Let $\Sigma(S)=\cup_{k=1}^{|S|}\Sigma_{k}(S)$ and $\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)=\cup_{t=k}^{|S|}\Sigma_{t}(S)$. It is known that if $0\not\in \Sigma(S)$, then $|\Sigma(S)|\geq |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$, where $|\mathrm{supp}(S)|$ denotes the number of distinct terms in $S$. In this paper, we study the above inequality. On one hand, we determine the sequence $S$ with $0\notin \Sigma(S)$ such that $|\Sigma(S)|= |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$. As a corollary, we disprove a conjecture of Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia. On the other hand, we generate the above inequality as if $|S|&gt;k$ and $0\not\in \Sigma_{\geq k}(S)\cup \Sigma_{1}(S)$, then $|\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)|\geq |S|-k+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|$. Then among other results, we give an alternative proof of a conjecture of Hamidoune, which was first proved by Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Canonical theorems in geometric Ramsey theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Euclidean Ramsey Theory usually we are looking for monochromatic configurations in the Euclidean space, whose points are colored with a fixed number of colors. In the canonical version, the number of colors is arbitrary, and we are looking for an `unavoidable' set of colorings of a finite configuration, that is a set of colorings with the property that one of them always appears in any coloring of the space. This set definitely includes the monochromatic and the rainbow colorings. In the present paper, we prove the following two results of this type. First, for any acute triangle $T$, and any coloring of $\mathbb{R}^3$, there is either a monochromatic or a rainbow copy of $T$. Second, for every $m$, there exists a sufficiently large $n$ such that in any coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists either a monochromatic or a rainbow $m$-dimensional unit hypercube. In the maximum norm, $\ell_{\infty}$, we have a much stronger statement. For every finite $M$, there exits an $n$ such that in any coloring of $\mathbb{R}_\infty^n$, there is either a monochromatic or a rainbow isometric copy of $M$.</description>

      <title>Self-affinity of discs under glass-cut dissections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological disc is called $n$-self-affine if it has a dissection into $n$ affine images of itself. It is called $n$-gc-self-affine if the dissection is obtained by successive glass-cuts, which are cuts along segments splitting one disc into two. For every $n \ge 2$, we characterize all $n$-gc-self-affine discs. All such discs turn out to be either triangles or convex quadrangles. All triangles and trapezoids are $n$-gc-self-affine for every $n$. Non-trapezoidal quadrangles are not $n$-gc-self-affine for even $n$. They are $n$-gc-self-affine for every odd $n \ge 7$, and they are $n$-gc-self-affine for $n=5$ if they aren't affine kites. Only four one-parameter families of quadrangles turn out to be $3$-gc-self-affine.
  In addition, we show that every convex quadrangle is $n$-self-affine for all $n \ge 5$.</description>

      <title>The B\'ar\'any-Kalai conjecture for certain families of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B\'ar\'any and Kalai conjectured the following generalization of Tverberg's theorem: if $f$ is a linear function from an $m$-dimensional polytope $P$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $m \ge (d + 1)(r - 1)$, then there are $r$ pairwise disjoint faces of $P$ whose images have a point in common. We show that the conjecture holds for cross polytopes, cyclic polytopes, and more generally for $(d+1)$-neighborly polytopes. Moreover, we show that for cross polytopes, the conjecture holds if the map $f$ is assumed to be continuous (but not necessarily linear), and we give a lower bound on the number of sets of $r$ pairwise disjoint faces whose images under $f$ intersect. We also show that the conjecture holds for all polytopes when $d=1$ and $f$ is assumed to be continuous. Finally, when $r$ is prime or large enough with respect to $d$, we prove that there exists a constant $c=c(d,r)$, depending only on $d$ and $r$, such that the conjecture holds (with continuous functions) for the polytope obtained by taking $c$ subdivisions of $P$.</description>

      <title>The Terwilliger algebras of doubly regular tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of asymmetric association schemes of rank $3$, whose nonidentity relations correspond to doubly regular tournaments, are shown to have thin irreducible modules, and to always be of dimension $4k+9$ for some positive integer $k$. It is determined that asymmetric rank $3$ association schemes of order up to $23$ are determined up to combinatorial isomorphism by the list of their complex Terwilliger algebras at each vertex, but this no longer true at order $27$. To distinguish order $27$ asymmetric rank $3$ association schemes, it is shown using computer calculations that the list of rational Terwilliger algebras at each vertex will suffice.</description>

      <title>Strong coalitions in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $D\subset V(G)$ is a strong dominating set of $G$, if for every vertex $x\in V (G)\setminus D$ there is a vertex $y\in D$ with $xy \in E(G)$ and $deg(x)\leq deg(y)$. A strong coalition consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, neither of which is a strong dominating set but whose union $V_{1}\cup V_{2}$, is a strong dominating set. A vertex partition $\Omega=\{V_1, V_2,..., V_k \}$ of vertices in $G$ is a strong coalition partition, if every set $V_i \in\Omega$ either is a strong dominating set consisting of a single vertex of degree $n-1$, or is not a strong dominating set but produces a strong coalition with another set $V_j \in \Omega$ that is not a strong dominating set. The maximum cardinality of a strong coalition partition of $G$ is the strong coalition number of $G$ and is denoted by $SC(G)$. In this paper, we study properties of strong coalitions in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository note we show how combinatorial Nullstellensatz by N. Alon naturally appears in solutions of elementary problems. Simple ideas gradually and naturally appear in such solutions, thus bringing a reader to generalizations. The note is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area, and to students familiar with polynomials.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Bounds and Reverse Hypercontractivity on HDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal concentration of measure for lifted functions on high dimensional expanders (HDX). Let $X$ be a $k$-dimensional HDX. We show for any $i\leq k$ and $f:X(i)\to [0,1]$: \[\Pr_{s\in X(k)}\left[\left|\underset{{t\subseteq s}}{\mathbb{E}}[f(t)]-\mu\right|\geq\varepsilon\right]\leq exp\left(-\varepsilon^2\frac{k}{i}\right).\] Using this fact, we prove that high dimensional expanders are reverse hypercontractive, a powerful functional inequality from discrete analysis implying that for any sets $A,B \subset X(k)$, the probability a $\rho$-correlated pair passes between them is at least \[\Pr_{s,s' \sim T_\rho}[s \in A, s' \in B] \geq \Pr[A]^{O(1)} \Pr[B]^{O(1)}.\] Our results hold under weak spectral assumptions on $X$. Namely we prove exponential concentration of measure for any complex below the `Trickling-Down Threshold' (beyond which concentration may be arbitrarily poor), and optimal concentration for $\sqrt{k}$-skeletons of such complexes. We also show optimal bounds for the top dimension of stronger HDX among other settings. We leverage our inequalities to prove several new agreement testing theorems on high dimensional expanders, including a new 99%-regime test for subsets, and a variant of the `Z-test' achieving inverse exponential soundness under the stronger assumption of $\ell_\infty$-expansion. The latter gives rise to the first optimal testers beyond the complete complex and products, a stepping stone toward the use of HDX in strong soundness PCPs. We also give applications within expansion, analysis, combinatorics, and coding theory, including a proof that two-sided HDX have optimal geometric overlap (giving the first explicit bounded-degree construction), near-optimal double samplers, new super-exponential degree lower bounds for certain HDX, distance-amplified list-decodable and locally testable codes, a Frankl-R\"odl Theorem and more.</description>

      <title>Batch Array Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch codes are a type of codes specifically designed for coded distributed storage systems and private information retrieval protocols. These codes have got much attention in recent years due to their ability to enable efficient and secure storage in distributed systems.
  In this paper, we study an array code version of the batch codes, which is called the \emph{batch array code} (BAC). Under the setting of BAC, each node stores a bucket containing multiple code symbols and responds with a locally computed linear combination of the symbols in its bucket during the recovery of a requested symbol. We demonstrate that BACs can support the same type of requests as the original batch codes but with reduced redundancy. Specifically, we establish information theoretic lower bounds on the code lengths and provide several code constructions that confirm the tightness of the lower bounds for certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution.</description>

      <title>Constructing heat kernels on infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, edge- and vertex-weighted graph with certain reasonable restrictions. We construct the heat kernel of the associated Laplacian using an adaptation of the parametrix approach due to Minakshisundaram-Pleijel in the setting of Riemannian geometry. This is partly motivated by the wish to relate the heat kernels of a graph and a subgraph, or of a domain and a discretization of it. As an application, assuming that the graph is locally finite, we express the heat kernel $H_G(x,y;t)$ as a Taylor series with the lead term being $a(x,y)t^r$, where $r$ is the combinatorial distance between $x$ and $y$ and $a(x,y)$ depends (explicitly) upon edge and vertex weights. In the case $G$ is the regular $(q+1)$-tree with $q\geq 1$, our construction reproves different explicit formulas due to Chung-Yau and to Chinta-Jorgenson-Karlsson. Assuming uniform boundedness of the combinatorial vertex degree, we show that a dilated Gaussian depending on any distance metric on $G$, which is uniformly bounded from below can be taken as a parametrix in our construction. Our work extends in part the recent articles [LNY21, CJKS23] in that the graphs are infinite and weighted.</description>

      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

      <title>Sandpile Groups of Cayley Graphs of $\mathbb{F}_2^r$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sandpile group of a connected graph $G$, defined to be the torsion part of the cokernel of the graph Laplacian, is a subtle graph invariant with combinatorial, algebraic, and geometric descriptions. Extending and improving previous works on the sandpile group of hypercubes, we study the sandpile groups of the Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{F}_2^r$, focusing on their poorly understood Sylow-$2$ component. We find the number of Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors for "generic" Cayley graphs and deduce a bound for the non-generic ones. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for their largest Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors. In the case of hypercubes, we give exact formulae for the largest $n-1$ Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors. Some key ingredients of our work include the natural ring structure on these sandpile groups from representation theory, and calculation of the $2$-adic valuations of binomial sums via the combinatorics of carries.</description>

      <title>Several new product identities in relation to two-variable Rogers-Ramanujan type sums and mock theta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product identities in two variables $x, q$ expand infinite products as infinite sums, which are linear combinations of theta functions; famous examples include Jacobi's triple product identity, Watson's quintuple identity, and Hirschhorn's septuple identity. We view these series expansions as representations in canonical bases of certain vector spaces of quasiperiodic meromorphic functions (related to sections of line and vector bundles), and find new identities for two nonuple products, an undecuple product, and several two-variable Rogers-Ramanujan type sums. Our main theorem explains a correspondence between the septuple product identity and the two original Rogers-Ramanujan identities, involving two-variable analogues of fifth-order mock theta functions. We also prove a similar correspondence between an octuple product identity of Ewell and two simpler variations of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, which is related to third-order mock theta functions, and conjecture other occurrences of this phenomenon. As applications, we specialize our results to obtain identities for quotients of generalized Dedekind eta functions and mock theta functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $M,$ path eigenvalues are eigenvalues of its path matrix. The path energy of a simple graph $M$ is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the path eigenvalues of the graph $M$ (Shikare et. al, 2018). We have discovered new upper constraints on path energy in this study, expressed in terms of a graph's maximum degree. Additionally, a relationship between a graph's energy and path energy is given.</description>

Abstract: In 1983, Borowiecki and J\'o\'zwiak posed the problem ``Characterize those graphs which have purely imaginary per-spectrum.'' This problem is still open. The most general result, although a partial solution, was given in 2004 by Yan and Zhang, who show that if $G$ is a bipartite graph containing no subgraph which is an even subdivision of $K_{2,3}$, then it has purely imaginary per-spectrum. Zhang and Li in 2012 proved that such graphs are planar and admit a Pfaffian orientation. In this article, we describe how to construct graphs with purely imaginary per-spectrum having a subgraph which is an even subdivision of $K_{2,3}$ (planar and nonplanar) using coalescence of rooted graphs.</description>

      <title>Comparing list-color functions of uniform hypergraphs with their chromatic polynomials (III)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypergraph ${\cal H}$, let $P({\cal H},k)$ and $P_l({\cal H},k)$ be its chromatic polynomial and list-color function respectively, and let $\tau'({\cal H})$ be the least non-negative integer $q$ such that $P({\cal H},k)=P_l({\cal H},k)$ holds for all integers $k\ge q$. In this article, we show that for any $r$-uniform hypergraph ${\cal H}$ of order $n$ and size $m$ and any $k$-assignment $L$ of ${\cal H}$, where $r\ge 3$, $P({\cal H},L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge \min \{0.02k, k-(m-1)\} k^{n-r-1}\sum_{e\in E({\cal H})} \left ( k-\left |\bigcap_{v\in e}L(v)\right | \right )$ holds for $k\ge m-1\ge 4$. It follows that $\tau'({\cal H})\le m-1$, improving the current best result on $\tau'({\cal H})$.</description>

      <title>Brooks-type theorems for relaxations of square colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following relaxation of proper coloring the square of a graph was recently introduced: for a positive integer $h$, the proper $h$-conflict-free chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{pcf}^h(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a proper $k$-coloring where every vertex $v$ has $\min\{deg_G(v),h\}$ colors appearing exactly once on its neighborhood. Caro, Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski put forth a Brooks-type conjecture: if $G$ is a graph with $\Delta(G)\ge 3$, then $\chi_{pcf}^1(G)\leq \Delta(G)+1$. The best known result regarding the conjecture is $\chi_{pcf}^1(G)\leq 2\Delta(G)+1$, which is implied by a result of Pach and Tardos. We improve upon the aforementioned result for all $h$, and also enlarge the class of graphs for which the conjecture is known to be true.
  Our main result is the following: for a graph $G$, if $\Delta(G) \ge h+2$, then $\chi_{pcf}^h(G)\le (h+1)\Delta(G)-1$; this is tight up to the additive term as we explicitly construct infinitely many graphs $G$ with $\chi_{pcf}^h(G)=(h+1)(\Delta(G)-1)$. We also show that the conjecture is true for chordal graphs, and obtain partial results for quasi-line graphs and claw-free graphs. Our main result also improves upon a Brooks-type result for $h$-dynamic coloring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A clique transversal in a graph is a set of vertices intersecting all maximal cliques. The problem of determining the minimum size of a clique transversal has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the study of the ''upper'' variant of this parameter, the upper clique transversal number, defined as the maximum size of a minimal clique transversal. We investigate this parameter from the algorithmic and complexity points of view, with a focus on various graph classes. We show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete in the classes of chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cubic planar bipartite graphs, and line graphs of bipartite graphs, but solvable in linear time in the classes of split graphs, proper interval graphs, and cographs, and in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cliquewidth. We conclude the paper with a number of open questions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first describe how to find the generating function for the sum of the areas under generalized Dyck paths (with an arbitrary set of steps) using Motzkin paths as a motivating example. We then focus on Motzkin and Dyck paths, deriving functional equations for them. We then describe an algorithm to manipulate these functional equations for finding `perturbation expansions' of the solutions, with applications for deriving explicit generating functions for the sum of powers of areas under Dyck and Motzkin paths for any desired power.</description>

      <title>Denniston partial difference sets exist in the odd prime case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denniston constructed partial difference sets (PDSs) with the parameters $(2^{3m}, (2^{m+r} - 2^m + 2^r)(2^m-1), 2^m-2^r+(2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-2), (2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-1))$ in elementary abelian groups of order $2^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2, 1 \leq r &lt; m$. These correspond to maximal arcs in Desarguesian projective planes of even order. In this paper, we show that - although maximal arcs do not exist in Desarguesian projective planes of odd order - PDSs with the Denniston parameters $(p^{3m}, (p^{m+r} - p^m + p^r)(p^m-1), p^m-p^r+(p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-2), (p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-1))$ exist in all elementary abelian groups of order $p^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2, r \in \{1, m-1\}$ where $p$ is an odd prime, and present a construction. Our approach uses PDSs formed as unions of cyclotomic classes.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of graphs with local total antimagic chromatic number 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A total labeling of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be local total antimagic if it is a bijection $f: V\cup E \to\{1,\ldots ,|V|+|E|\}$ such that adjacent vertices, adjacent edges, and incident vertex and edge have distinct induced weights where the induced weight of a vertex $v$, $w_f(v) = \sum f(e)$ with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident to $v$, and the induced weight of an edge $uv$ is $w_f(uv) = f(u) + f(v)$. The local total antimagic chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{lt}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex and edge weights over all local total antimagic labelings of $G$. In this paper, we first obtained general lower and upper bounds for $\chi_{lt}(G)$ and sufficient conditions to construct a graph $H$ with $k$ pendant edges and $\chi_{lt}(H) \in\{\Delta(H)+1, k+1\}$. We then completely characterized graphs $G$ with $\chi_{lt}(G)=3$. Many families of (disconnected) graphs $H$ with $k$ pendant edges and $\chi_{lt}(H) \in\{\Delta(H)+1, k+1\}$ are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Chmutov proved that the partial-dual polynomial considered as a function on chord diagrams satisfies the four-term relations. In this paper, we show that this function on framed chord diagrams also satisfies the four-term relations, i.e., is a framed weight system.</description>

      <title>Zero forcing irredundant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irredundance has been studied in the context of dominating sets, via the concept of private neighbor. Here irredundance of zero forcing sets is introduced via the concept of a private fort and the upper and lower zero forcing irrdedundance numbers $\mbox{ZIR}(G)$ and $\mbox{zir}(G)$ are defined. Bounds on $\mbox{ZIR}(G)$ and $\mbox{zir}(G)$ are established and graphs having extreme values of $\mbox{ZIR}(G)$ and $\mbox{zir}(G)$ are characterized. The effect of the join and corona operations is studied. As the concept of a zero forcing irrdedundant set is new, there are many questions for future research.</description>

      <title>The interplay between additive and symmetric large sets and their combinatorial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of symmetric structures is a new trend in Ramsey theory. Recently in [7], Di Nasso initiated a systematic study of symmetrization of classical Ramsey theoretical results, and proved a symmetric version of several Ramsey theoretic results. In this paper Di Nasso asked if his method could be adapted to find new non-linear Diophantine equations that are partition regular [7,Final remarks (4)]. By analyzing additive, multiplicative, and symmetric large sets, we construct new partition regular equations that give a first affirmative answer to this question. A special case of our result shows that if $P$ is a polynomial with no constant term then the equation $x+P(y-x)=z+w+zw$, where $y\neq x$ is partition regular. Also we prove several new monochromatic patterns involving additive, multiplicative, and symmetric structures. Throughout our work, we use tools from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactifications of discrete semigroups.</description>

      <title>Commutative Properties of Schubert Puzzles with Convex Polygonal Boundary Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize classical triangular Schubert puzzles to puzzles with convex polygonal boundary. We give these puzzles a geometric Schubert calculus interpretation and derive novel combinatorial commutativity statements, using purely geometric arguments, for puzzles with four, five, and six sides, having various types of symmetry in their boundary conditions. We also present formulas for the associated structure constants in terms of Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and we prove an analogue of commutativity for parallelogram-shaped equivariant puzzles.</description>

      <title>Stability, corners, and other 2-dimensional shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation of stability, called robust stability, which is insensitive to perturbations by subsets of Loeb measure $0$ in a pseudofinite group. We show that robust stability satisfies a stationarity principle for measure independent elements. We apply this principle to deduce the existence of squares in dense robustly stable subsets of Cartesian products of non-standard finite groups, possibly non-abelian. Our results imply qualitative asymptotic versions for Cartesian products of finite groups. In the final section, we establish the existence of $3\times 2$-grids (and thus of $L$-shapes) in dense robustly stable $2$-dimensional subsets of finite abelian groups of odd order.</description>

      <title>The reachability homology of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen the development of path homology and magnitude homology -- two homology theories of directed graphs, each satisfying classic properties such as Kunneth and Mayer-Vietoris theorems. Recent work of Asao has shown that magnitude homology and path homology are related, appearing in different pages of a certain spectral sequence. Here we study the target of that spectral sequence, which we call reachability homology. We prove that it satisfies appropriate homotopy invariance, Kunneth, excision, and Mayer-Vietoris theorems, these all being stronger than the corresponding properties for either magnitude or path homology.</description>

      <title>Dao numbers and the asymptotic behaviour of fullness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the Dao numbers $\mathfrak{d}_1(I),\mathfrak{d}_2(I)$ and $\mathfrak{d}_3(I)$ of an ideal $I$ of a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},K)$ or a standard graded Noetherian $K$-algebra. They are defined as the smallest $\ell\ge0$ such that $I\mathfrak{m}^k$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-full, full, weakly $\mathfrak{m}$-full, respectively, for all $k\ge\ell$. We provide general bounds for the Dao numbers in terms of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain modules over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(\mathfrak{m})$. If $R$ is a Koszul algebra, we prove that the Dao numbers are less or equal to $\text{reg}_{\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(R)}\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$, where $\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$ is the associated graded module of $I$. Finally, for monomial ideals, we combinatorially bound the Dao numbers in terms of asymptotic linear quotients and bounding multidegrees.</description>
