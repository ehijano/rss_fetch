      <title>Model underestimates of OH reactivity cause overestimate of hydrogen's climate impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying hydrogen technologies is one option to reduce energy carbon dioxide emissions, but recent studies have called attention to the indirect climate implications of fugitive hydrogen emissions. We find that biases in hydroxyl (OH) radical concentrations and reactivity in current atmospheric chemistry models may cause a 20% overestimate of the hydrogen Global Warming Potential (GWP). A better understanding of OH chemistry is critical for reliable estimates of the hydrogen GWP.</description>

      <title>Multiple states of two-dimensional turbulence above topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10826v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Siegelman \&amp; Young (PNAS, vol. 120(44), 2023, pp. e2308018120) revealed two extreme states reached by the evolution of unforced and weakly-damped two-dimensional turbulence above random rough topography, separated by a critical kinetic energy $E_\#$. The low- and high-energy solutions correspond to topographically-locked and roaming vortices, surrounded by non-uniform and homogeneous background potential vorticity (PV), respectively. However, we found that these phenomena are restricted to the particular intermediate length scale where the energy was initially injected into the system. Through simulations initialised by injecting the energy at larger and smaller length scales, we found that the long-term state of topographic turbulence is also dependent on the initial length scale and thus the initial enstrophy. If the initial length scale is comparable with the domain size, the long-term flow field resembles the minimum-enstrophy state proposed by Bretherton \&amp; Haidvogel (J. Fluid Mech., vol.78(1), 1976, pp. 129-154), with very few topographically-locked vortices; the long-term enstrophy is quite close to the minimum value, especially when the energy is no larger than $E_\#$. As the initial length scale becomes smaller, more vortices nucleate and become more mobile; the long-term enstrophy increasingly deviates from the minimum value. Simultaneously, the background PV tends to homogenization, even if the energy is below $E_\#$. These results complement the phenomenology of topographic turbulence documented by Siegelman \&amp; Young, by showing that the minimum-enstrophy and background PV homogenization states can be adequately approached by large- and small-scale initial fields, respectively, with relatively arbitrary energy.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based sequential data assimilation for chaotic dynamics identifies local instabilities from single state forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ability to discover data assimilation (DA) schemes meant for chaotic dynamics with deep learning (DL). The focus is on learning the analysis step of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a simple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be known. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display spatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist. The accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that of the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and is far better than that of variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while propagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the reason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We diagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical perturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast state alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This reveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic theorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical system.</description>

      <title>AI for operational methane emitter monitoring from space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating methane emissions is the fastest way to stop global warming in the short-term and buy humanity time to decarbonise. Despite the demonstrated ability of remote sensing instruments to detect methane plumes, no system has been available to routinely monitor and act on these events. We present MARS-S2L, an automated AI-driven methane emitter monitoring system for Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery deployed operationally at the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We compile a global dataset of thousands of super-emission events for training and evaluation, demonstrating that MARS-S2L can skillfully monitor emissions in a diverse range of regions globally, providing a 216% improvement in mean average precision over a current state-of-the-art detection method. Running this system operationally for six months has yielded 457 near-real-time detections in 22 different countries of which 62 have already been used to provide formal notifications to governments and stakeholders.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>

Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>FuXi-ENS: A machine learning model for medium-range ensemble weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasting is crucial for improving weather predictions, especially for forecasts of extreme events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on conventional NWP models is highly computationally expensive. ML models have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providing forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and even surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However, challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML models, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 EDA or operational NWP ensemble members for forecast generation. Their spatial resolution is also considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly increased spatial resolution of 0.25\textdegree, incorporating 5 atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the CRPS and the KL divergence between the predicted and target distribution, facilitating the incorporation of flow-dependent perturbations in both initial conditions and forecast. This innovative approach makes FuXi-ENS an advancement over the traditional ones that use L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models for ensemble weather forecasting. Results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the ECMWF, a world leading NWP model, in the CRPS of 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations. This achievement underscores the potential of the FuXi-ENS model to enhance ensemble weather forecasts, offering a promising direction for further development in this field.</description>
