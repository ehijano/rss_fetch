      <title>On subshifts with low maximal pattern complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ and a sequence $x \in \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$, Kamae and Zamboni defined the maximal pattern complexity function $p^*_x(n)$ as a natural generalization of usual word complexity. They defined a nonperiodic sequence $x$ to be pattern Sturmian if it achieves the minimal growth rate $p^*_x(n) = 2n$, and asked the question of whether one could classify recurrent pattern Sturmian sequences.
  We answer their question by characterizing recurrent pattern Sturmian sequences as one of two known types: either a coding of an irrational circle rotation by two intervals, or an element of what we call a nearly simple Toeplitz subshift.
  We also show that nonrecurrent pattern Sturmian sequences are either very close to constant (such examples were given by Kamae and Zamboni) or a (nonrecurrent) coding of an irrational circle rotation by two intervals.
  Our main new technique is to use topological properties of the maximal equicontinuous factor (MEF) of the subshift generated by $x$. In this way, we prove a general structural result about sequences with non-superlinear maximal pattern complexity: they are either nonrecurrent or minimal with MEF either an odometer or the product of a circle with a finite cyclic group.</description>

      <title>An infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorem and the construction of almost periodic breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorems based on nonresonant frequencies of Bourgain's Diophantine type or even weaker conditions. To be more precise, under a nondegenerate condition for an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, we prove the persistence of a full-dimensional KAM torus with the universally prescribed frequency that is independent of any spectral asymptotics. As an application, we prove that for a class of perturbed networks with weakly coupled oscillators described by \[\frac{{{{\rm d}^2}{x_n}}}{{{\rm d}{t^2}}} + V'\left( {{x_n}} \right) = \varepsilon_n {W'\left( {{x_{n + 1}} - {x_n}} \right) - \varepsilon_{n-1}W'\left( {{x_n} - {x_{n - 1}}} \right)} ,\;\;n \in \mathbb{Z},\] or even for more general perturbed networks, almost periodic breathers with frequency-preserving do exist, provided that the local potential $ V $ and the coupling potential $ W $ satisfy certain assumptions. In particular, this yields the first frequency-preserving version of the Aubry-MacKay conjecture [8,21].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a methodology to learn finitely generated random iterated function systems from time-series of partial observations using delay embeddings. We obtain a minimal model representation for the observed dynamics, using a hidden variable representation, that is diffeomorphic to the original system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical families of regular polynomial endomorphisms on $\mathbb{P}^2$ with many periodic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for a regular polynomial endomorphism of positive degree on $\mathbb{P}^2$, a family of curves containing a Zariski dense set of periodic curves is invariant under some iterate of the endomorphism. The setting is closely related to the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture, recently proposed by DeMarco and Mavraki, which concerns a parametrized family of endomorphisms and varieties. Our result proves a weaker version of the conjecture where the endomorphism is a regular polynomial endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^2$ that remains fixed in the family, and the family of curves contains a dense set of periodic curves. This result can also be viewed as a Dynamical Manin-Mumford type statement on the moduli space of divisors, and it proves a special case of the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture with a stronger assumption.
  Moreover, our result specifically implies a uniform degree stabilization statement for a generic set of curves in a family under the transformation of a regular polynomial endomorphism. We demonstrate that a more general degree stabilization statement for a family of positive dimension subvarieties in $\mathbb{P}^K$ under the transformation of a family of endomorphisms is predicted by the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture. We then prove that it is true when $K=2$ for families of regular polynomial endomorphisms under certain restrictions on the ramifications at the line at infinity.
  Finally, we demonstrate an application of our result to classify all regular polynomial endomorphisms that admit infinitely many periodic curves of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Self-composition of Frobenius a real number of times, and some conjectures around Weil's Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$.
  What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture, for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures almost follow from the Standard conjectures.
  All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>

      <title>Oscillation of delay differential equations via the hyper4 convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sharp condition is provided to guarantee that the (nontrivial) solutions of a DDE of the form $\dot{x}(t)+F(t,x)=0$ $t\geq 0,$ (where $F(t,\cdot)$ is an odd-like causal operator) either oscillate, or converge monotonically to zero. The method used is based on the convergence of the sequence of hyper4-iterations to the Lambert's function.</description>

      <title>Strongly resonant polarization dynamics of pulse trains in a spin-flip model for an excitable microlaser with delayed self-feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations concerning the polarization dynamics in an excitable microlaser with saturable absorber coupled to an external feedback mirror reported in [Ruschel et al. (2025) Opt. Lett. 50 (8) 2618], we propose here an in-depth theoretical investigation of the locked dynamics of regenerative vectorial pulse trains that this system produces. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of self-sustained pulse trains of a corresponding spin-flip model with delayed feedback. Its focus is on strongly resonant regimes, where the modulation of the peak intensities of polarized regenerative pulse trains locks to 2, 3 and 4 times the pulse regeneration time. Specifically, we identify points of strongly resonant rotation numbers on curves of torus bifurcations in the parameter plane of the amplitude and phase anisotropy parameters, and continue emerging curves of fold and period-doubling bifurcations to identify locking regions. In this way, we clarify where pulse trains show strongly resonant polarization dynamics and highlight that even weak polarization coupling in delay-coupled microlasers creates considerable dynamical richness. These results may have impact on the design of future coupled microlasers systems for neuroinspired on-chip computing, where the polarization of an excitable pulse can be used to encode or process information.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Semantic Diffusion: A p-Laplacian Synthesis with Learnable Dissipation, Quantified Constants, and Graph-Aware Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a calibrated diffusion framework by synthesizing three established concepts: linear Laplacian smoothing, nonlinear graph p-Laplacian flows, and a learnable dissipation term derived from a strongly convex potential. This synthesis provides a general model for graph-based diffusion with controllable dynamics. Our key theoretical results include a quantified two-regime decay analysis for $p&gt;2$, which provides stronger, p-dependent transient bounds not captured by standard ISS templates, and the first formalization of a "non-synonymy" impossibility principle, which proves that fixed-parameter models cannot meet universal performance targets across graphs with varying spectral properties. To address this, we propose a constructive calibration algorithm (SGPS) with formal guarantees for achieving target rates and mass. We derive explicit, closed-form lower bounds for the graph p-gap on canonical graphs a notable improvement over prior implicit estimates and provide sharp constants for discrete-time and stochastic stability, including a contextualized restatement of the necessary and sufficient Euler step-size and a strengthened analysis of the stochastic noise floor. Illustrative, small-scale empirical validations confirm the tightness of key theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is dynamically central syndetic if it contains the times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself in a minimal topological dynamical system. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. This gives a "global" analogue to the well-known "local" characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. Applying the main result, we answer two open questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass concerning sets of pointwise topological recurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zero entropy locus for the Lozi maps. We first define a region $R$ in the parameter space and prove that for the parameters in $R$, the Lozi maps have the topological entropy zero. $R$ is contained in a larger region where every Lozi map has a unique period-two orbit, and that orbit is attracting. It is easy to see that the zero entropy locus cannot coincide with that larger region since it contains parameters for which the fixed point of the corresponding Lozi map has homoclinic points.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Koopman Semigroup Estimation in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD), a novel data-driven framework for approximating the Koopman semigroup in stochastic dynamical systems. Unlike existing methods, SDMD explicitly incorporates sampling time into its approximation, ensuring numerical stability and precision. By directly approximating the Koopman semigroup instead of the generator, SDMD avoids computationally expensive matrix exponential computations, which offers a more efficient and practical pathway for analyzing stochastic dynamics. The framework further integrates neural networks to automate basis selection, which reduces the reliance on manual intervention while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous theoretical guarantees, including convergence in the large data limit, zero-limit of sampling time, and large dictionary size, establish the method's reliability. Numerical experiments on canonical stochastic systems validate SDMD's effectiveness in approximating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the stochastic Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of synchronized solutions in a continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of the completely synchronized state in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs. Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of $\ell$-humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions ($\ell\ge 2$) appears. This contrasts the author's recent result on the classical KM for which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.</description>
