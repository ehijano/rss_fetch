      <title>Improving Trainability of Variational Quantum Circuits via Regularization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely applied in various domains, advancing the superiority of quantum circuits against classic models. Similar to classic models, regular VQCs can be optimized by various gradient-based methods. However, the optimization may be initially trapped in barren plateaus or eventually entangled in saddle points during training. These gradient issues can significantly undermine the trainability of VQC. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the train data and Gaussian noise diffusion. We conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our strategy across four public datasets and demonstrate that our method can improve the trainability of VQCs against the above-mentioned gradient issues.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Aspects Of Resources Distribution In Quantum Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in multimode bosonic systems: I. Inherited and genuine singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid (i.e., diabolically degenerated exceptional) singularities of simple bosonic systems composed of up to five modes with damping and/or amplification are analyzed. Their dynamics governed by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is followed using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points, observed directly in the dynamics of field operators, having up to third-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed. Exceptional and diabolical genuine points and their degeneracies observed in the dynamics of second-order field-operator moments are analyzed. Surprisingly, exceptional degeneracies of only second and third orders are revealed. Nevertheless the analyzed bosonic systems exhibit rich dynamics, also owing to their common second-order diabolical degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in multimode bosonic systems: II. Nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics and unidirectional coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points of simple bosonic systems, composed of up to six modes with damping and/or amplification and exhibiting nonconventional dynamics. They involve the configurations in which the dynamics typical for PT-symmetric systems is observed only in a subspace of the whole Liouville space of the system states (nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics) as well as those containing unidirectional coupling. The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems that exhibit physically meaningful behavior at arbitrary times. On the other hand, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies on demand. This approach allows for the creation of arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies observed in systems with diverse structures. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points, and determining their degeneracies are discussed. Rich dynamics of higher-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points with their degeneracies in general.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectral signatures of non-Markovianity beyond Born-Redfield master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory or time-non-local effects in open quantum dynamics pose theoretical as well as practical challenges in the understanding and control of noisy quantum systems. While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy is used to study the geometric properties of an ensemble of finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with known average energy. These geometric characterization is given in terms of the generalized diagonal Bloch vectors and the invariants of the special unitary group in $n$ dimensions. As examples, Hamiltonians written in terms of linear and quadratic generators of the angular momentum algebra are considered with $J= 1$ and $J=3/2$. For these cases, paths as functions of the temperature are established in the corresponding simplex representations, as well as the adiabatic evolution of the interaction strengths of the Hamiltonian models. For the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian the quantum phase diagram is explicitly shown for different temperature values in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on quantum kernel methods have been investigated previously [1]. A quantum advantage is derived from the fact that it is possible to construct a family of datasets for which, only quantum processing can recognise the intrinsic labelling patterns, while for classical computers the dataset looks like noise. This is due to the algorithm leveraging inherent efficiencies in the computation of logarithms in a cyclic group. The discrete log problem.is a well-known advantage of quantum vs classical computation: where it is possible to generate all the members of the group using a single mathematical operation. Kernel methods are a powerful and popular technique in classical Machine Learning. The use of a quantum feature space that can only be calculated efficiently on a quantum computer potentially allows for deriving a quantum advantage. In this paper, we intend to first describe the application of such a kernel method to a Quantum version of the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to identify conditions under which, a quantum advantage is realised. A data dependent projected quantum kernel was shown to provide significant advantage over classical kernels. Further, we present results of investigations and ideas pertaining to extending the use of quantum kernels as a feature extraction layer in a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is a widely used architecture in deep-learning applications.</description>

      <title>Performance of Superconducting Resonators Suspended on SiN Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated errors in superconducting circuits due to nonequilibrium quasiparticles are a notable concern in efforts to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing. The propagation of quasiparticles causing these correlated errors can potentially be mediated by phonons in the substrate. Therefore, methods that decouple devices from the substrate are possible solutions, such as isolating devices atop SiN membranes. In this work, we validate the compatibility of SiN membrane technology with high quality superconducting circuits, adding the technique to the community's fabrication toolbox. We do so by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop a thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN layer, where the bulk Si originally supporting it has been etched away, achieving a suspended membrane where the shortest length to its thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect the resonator thermalization rate. With these important benchmarks validated, this technique can be extended to qubits.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity and average-case hardness of shallow-depth boson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling, a computational task believed to be classically hard to simulate, is expected to hold promise for demonstrating quantum computational advantage using near-term quantum devices. However, noise in experimental implementations poses a significant challenge, potentially rendering boson sampling classically simulable and compromising its classical intractability. Numerous studies have proposed classical algorithms under various noise models that can efficiently simulate boson sampling as noise rates increase with circuit depth. To address this issue particularly related to circuit depth, we explore the viability of achieving quantum computational advantage through boson sampling with shallow-depth linear optical circuits. Specifically, as the average-case hardness of estimating output probabilities of boson sampling is a crucial ingredient in demonstrating its classical intractability, we make progress on establishing the average-case hardness confined to logarithmic-depth regimes. We also obtain the average-case hardness for logarithmic-depth Fock-state boson sampling subject to lossy environments and for the logarithmic-depth Gaussian boson sampling. By providing complexity-theoretical backgrounds for the classical simulation hardness of logarithmic-depth boson sampling, we expect that our findings will mark a crucial step towards a more noise-tolerant demonstration of quantum advantage with shallow-depth boson sampling.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising quantum information platforms but are susceptible to magnetic noise. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near nanostructured lossy material components essential in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum sensing and computing, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise for enhancing spin qubit quantum sensing and computing performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. We further apply our theoretical framework to control noise effects in realistic quantum computing devices and quantum sensing applications. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Probabilistic Error Cancellation with Noisy Recovery Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) aims to improve the accuracy of expectation values for observables.This is accomplished using the probabilistic insertion of recovery gates, which correspond to the inverse of errors.However, the inserted recovery gates also induce errors. Thus, it is difficult to obtain accurate expectation values with PEC since the estimator of PEC has a bias due to noise induced by recovery gates.To address this challenge, we propose an improved version of PEC that considers the noise resulting from gate insertion, called Feed-Forward PEC (FFPEC). FFPEC provides an unbiased estimator of expectation values by cancelling out the noise induced by recovery gates.We demonstrate that FFPEC yields more accurate expectation values compared to conventional PEC method through numerical simulations with bit-flip and depolarizing noises.</description>

      <title>Anomalously reduced homogeneous broadening of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy at high temperature by detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation and decoherence of quantum systems in thermal environments is important to various spectroscopies. It is generally believed that dissipation can broaden the line shape of spectroscopies, and thus stronger system-bath interaction can result in more significant homogeneous broadening of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Here we show that the case can be the opposite in the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We predict that assisted by EIT, the homogeneous broadening of the 2DES at a higher temperature can be significantly reduced due to the detailed balance. This anomalous effect is due to the long-lasting off-diagonal peaks in 2DES.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under the spatially dependent dipolar interaction, but shifted in the critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity in harmonic traps: a quantum-classical analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for efficiently transitioning a quantum system from an initial to a final stationary state in less time than is required by an adiabatic (quasi-static) process. Our approach makes use of Nelson's stochastic quantization, which represents the quantum system as a classical Brownian process. Thanks to this mathematical analogy, known protocols for classical overdamped systems can be translated into quantum protocols. In particular, one can use classical methods to find optimal quantum protocols that minimize both the time duration and some other cost function to be freely specified. We have applied this method to the time-dependent harmonic oscillator and tested it on two different cost functions: (i) the cumulative energy of the system over time and (ii) the dynamical phase of the wavefunction. In the latter case, it is possible to construct protocols that are "adiabatically optimal", i.e., they minimize their distance from an adiabatic process for a given duration.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, a boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a fundamental challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Noise classification in small quantum networks by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate machine learning-based noise classification aimed at the recognition of the Markovian character of a dynamics and the identification of correlations of classical noise, as well as their interplay in small quantum networks. We operate control based on Coherent Tunneling by Adiabatic Passage (CTAP) or Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in a three-level system using different pulse configurations as inputs to train a feedforward neural network. Our results show that supervised learning can classify distinct types of classical diagonal noise affecting the system. Three non-Markovian (quasistatic correlated, anti-correlated, and uncorrelated) and Markovian noise mechanisms are classified with $99\%$ accuracy. Instead, correlations of Markovian noises cannot be classified with our method. The approach is robust against statistical measurement errors keeping its effectiveness even for physical measurements where a limited number of samples is available.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using standard results from statistics, we show that for any continuous quantum system (Gaussian or otherwise) and any observable $A$ (position or otherwise), the distribution $ \pi _{a}\left(t\right) $ of a time measurement at a fixed state $a$ can be inferred from the distribution $ \rho _{t}\left( a\right) $ of a state measurement at a fixed time $t$ via the transformation $ \pi _{a}\left( t\right) = \left\vert \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_{-\infty }^{a}\rho _{t}\left( u\right) du \right\vert $. This finding suggests that the answer to the long-lasting time-of-arrival problem is in fact readily available in the standard formalism, secretly hidden within the Born rule, and therefore does not require the introduction of an ad-hoc time operator or a commitment to a specific (e.g., Bohmian) ontology. The generality and versatility of the result are illustrated by applications to the time-of-arrival at a given location for a free particle in a superposed state and to the time required to reach a given velocity for a free-falling quantum particle. Our approach also offers a potentially promising new avenue toward the design of an experimental protocol for the yet-to-be-performed observation of the phenomenon of quantum backflow.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum advantages in learning quantum observables from classical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are believed to bring computational advantages in simulating quantum many body systems. However, recent works have shown that classical machine learning algorithms are able to predict numerous properties of quantum systems with classical data. Despite various examples of learning tasks with provable quantum advantages being proposed, they all involve cryptographic functions and do not represent any physical scenarios encountered in laboratory settings. In this paper we prove quantum advantages for the physically relevant task of learning quantum observables from classical (measured out) data. We consider two types of observables: first we prove a learning advantage for linear combinations of Pauli strings, then we extend the result for the broader case of unitarily parametrized observables. For each type of observable we delineate the boundaries that separate physically relevant tasks which classical computers can solve using data from quantum measurements, from those where a quantum computer is still necessary for data analysis. Our results shed light on the utility of quantum computers for machine learning problems in the domain of quantum many body physics, thereby suggesting new directions where quantum learning improvements may emerge.</description>

      <title>Features, paradoxes and amendments of perturbative non-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics of unitary systems is considered in quasi-Hermitian representation. In this framework the concept of perturbation is found counterintuitive, for three reasons. The first one is that in this formalism we are allowed to change the physical Hilbert-space norm. Thus, in a preselected Hamiltonian $H(\lambda)=H_0+\lambda\,H_1$ the size (and, hence, influence) of the perturbation cannot always be kept under a reliable control. Often, an enhanced sensitivity to perturbations is observed, for this reason, in open quantum systems. Second, even when we consider just a closed quantum system in which the influence of $H_1\neq H_1^\dagger$ is guaranteed to be small, the correct probabilistic interpretation of the system remains ambiguous, mainly due to the non-uniqueness of the physical Hilbert-space inner-product metric~$\Theta$. Third, even if we decide to ignore the ambiguity and if we pick up just any one of the eligible metrics (which reduces the scope of the theory of course), such a choice would still vary with $\lambda$. In our paper it is shown that all of these three obstacles can be circumvented via just a mild amendment of the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation-expansion approach. The flexibility of $\Theta=\Theta(\lambda)$ is shown to remain tractable while opening several new model-building horizons including the study of generic random perturbations and/or of multiple specific non-Hermitian toy models. In parallel, several paradoxes and open questions are shown to survive.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Learning on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum computers are small and error-prone systems for which the term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) has become established. Since large scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are not expected to be available in the near future, the task of finding NISQ suitable algorithms has received a lot of attention in recent years. The most prominent candidates in this context are variational quantum algorithms. Due to their hybrid quantum-classical architecture they require fewer qubits and quantum gates so that they can cope with the limitations of NISQ computers. An important class of variational quantum algorithms is the quantum circuit learning (QCL) framework. Consisting of a data encoding and a trainable, parametrized layer, these schemes implement a quantum model function that can be fitted to the problem at hand. For instance, in combination with the parameter shift rule to compute derivatives, they can be used to solve differential equations. QCL and related algorithms have been widely studied in the literature. However, numerical experiments are usually limited to simulators and results from real quantum computers are scarce. In this paper we close this gap by executing QCL circuits on a superconducting IBM quantum processor in conjunction with an analysis of the hardware errors. We show that exemplary QCL circuits with up to three qubits are executable on the IBM quantum computer. For this purpose, multiple functions are learned and an exemplary differential equation is solved on the quantum computer. Moreover, we present how the QCL framework can be used to learn different quantum model functions in parallel, which can be applied to solve coupled differential equations in an efficient way.</description>

      <title>Transformer Models for Quantum Gate Set Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation represents a promising frontier in the domain of high-performance computing, blending quantum information theory with practical applications to overcome the limitations of classical computation. This study investigates the challenges of manufacturing high-fidelity and scalable quantum processors. Quantum gate set tomography (QGST) is a critical method for characterizing quantum processors and understanding their operational capabilities and limitations. This paper introduces ML4QGST as a novel approach to QGST by integrating machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing a transformer neural network model. Adapting the transformer model for QGST addresses the computational complexity of modeling quantum systems. Advanced training strategies, including data grouping and curriculum learning, are employed to enhance model performance, demonstrating significant congruence with ground-truth values. We benchmark this training pipeline on the constructed learning model, to successfully perform QGST for $3$ gates on a $1$ qubit system with over-rotation error and depolarizing noise estimation with comparable accuracy to pyGSTi. This research marks a pioneering step in applying deep neural networks to the complex problem of quantum gate set tomography, showcasing the potential of machine learning to tackle nonlinear tomography challenges in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the quantum East-West kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>New Angular Momentum Conservation Laws for Gauge Fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED) deals with the relativistic interaction of bosonic gauge fields and fermionic charged particles. In QED, global conservation laws of angular momentum for light-matter interactions are well-known. However, local conservation laws, i.e. the conservation law of angular momentum at every point in space, remain unexplored. Here, we use the QED Lagrangian and Noether's theorem to derive a new local conservation law of angular momentum for Dirac-Maxwell fields in the form of the continuity relation for linear momentum. We separate this local conservation law into four coupled motion equations for spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) densities. We introduce a helicity current tensor, OAM current tensor, and spin-orbit torque in the motion equations to shed light on on the local dynamics of spin-OAM interaction and angular momentum exchange between Maxwell-Dirac fields. We elucidate how our results translate to classical electrodynamics using the example of plane wave interference as well as a dual-mode optical fiber. Our results shine light on phenomena related to the spin of gauge bosons.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the R\'enyi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of an Optimization Algorithm for Metamaterial Design on the Integrated High-Performance Computing and Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing metamaterials with complex geometries is a big challenge. Although an active learning algorithm, combining machine learning (ML), quantum computing, and optical simulation, has emerged as an efficient optimization tool, it still faces difficulties in optimizing complex structures that have potentially high performance. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the performance of an optimization algorithm for metamaterial design on the integrated HPC and quantum systems. We demonstrate significant time advantages through message-passing interface (MPI) parallelization on the high-performance computing (HPC) system showing approximately 54% faster ML tasks and 67 times faster optical simulation against serial workloads. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of a quantum algorithm designed for optimization, which runs with various quantum simulators on a local computer or HPC-quantum system. Results showcase ~24 times speedup when executing the optimization algorithm on the HPC-quantum hybrid system. This study paves a way to optimize complex metamaterials using the integrated HPC-quantum system.</description>

      <title>Natural disorder distributions from measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scenarios where the dynamics of a quantum system are partially determined by prior local measurements of some interacting environmental degrees of freedom. The resulting effective system dynamics are described by a disordered Hamiltonian, with spacetime-varying parameter values drawn from distributions that are generically neither flat nor Gaussian. This class of scenarios is a natural extension of those where a fully non-dynamical environmental degree of freedom determines a universal coupling constant for the system. Using a family of quasi-exactly solvable anharmonic oscillators, we consider environmental ground states of nonlinearly coupled degrees of freedom, unrestricted by a weak coupling expansion, which include strongly quantum non-Gaussian states. We derive the properties of distributions for both quadrature and photon number measurements. Measurement-induced disorder of this kind is likely realizable in laboratory quantum systems and, given a notion of naturally occurring measurement, suggests a new class of scenarios for the dynamics of quantum systems in particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation of trapped molecules offers a promising platform for quantum technologies and quantum information processing. In parallel, quantum error correction codes that can protect quantum information encoded in rotational states of a single molecule have been developed. These codes are currently an abstract concept, as no implementation strategy is yet known. Here, we present a step towards experimental implementation of these codes by introducing architecture-agnostic check and correction operators. These operators can be decomposed into elements of the quantum logic spectroscopy toolbox that is available for molecular ions. We then describe and analyze a measurement-based sequential as well as an autonomous implementation strategy in the presence of thermal background radiation, a major noise source for rotation in polar molecules. The presented strategies and methods might enable robust sensing or even fault-tolerant quantum computing using the rotation of individual molecules.</description>

      <title>Fermionization and collective excitations of 1D polariton lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that the hallmarks of correlation and fermionization in a one-dimensional exciton-polaritons gas can be observed with state-of-the-art technology. Our system consists of a chain of excitonic quantum dots coupled to a photonic waveguide, with a low filling of polaritons. We analytically identify the Tonks-Girardeau, Tavis-Cummings and mean-field limits and relate them to different regimes of the excitonic anharmonicity and photonic bandwidth. Using matrix-product states, we numerically calculate the ground-state energies, correlation functions and dynamic structure factor of the system. In particular, the latter has a finite weight in the Lieb-Liniger hole branch, and the density-density correlator displays Friedel-like oscillations for realistic parameters, which reveal the onset of fermionization close to the Tonks-Girardeau regime. Our work encourages future experiments aimed at observing, for the first time and in spite of the moderate excitonic anharmonicity, strongly correlated exciton-polariton physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a calibration system based on a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror that is capable of delivering an optical beam over a wavelength range of 180 -- 2000 nm (0.62 -- 6.89 eV) in a sub-Kelvin environment. This portable, integrated system can steer the beam over a $\sim$3 cm $\times$ 3 cm area on the surface of any sensor with a precision of $\sim$100 $\mu$m, enabling characterization of device response as a function of position. This fills a critical need in the landscape of calibration tools for sub-Kelvin devices, including those used for dark matter detection and quantum computing. These communities have a shared goal of understanding the impact of ionizing radiation on device performance, which can be pursued with our system. This paper describes the design of the first-generation calibration system and the results from successfully testing its performance at room temperature and 20 mK.</description>

      <title>Characterizing randomness in parameterized quantum circuits through expressibility and average entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While scalable error correction schemes and fault tolerant quantum computing seem not to be universally accessible in the near sight, the efforts of many researchers have been directed to the exploration of the contemporary available quantum hardware. Due to these limitations, the depth and dimension of the possible quantum circuits are restricted. This motivates the study of circuits with parameterized operations that can be classically optimized in hybrid methods as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), enabling the reduction of circuit depth and size. The characteristics of these Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) are still not fully understood outside the scope of their principal application, motivating the study of their intrinsic properties. In this work, we analyse the generation of random states in PQCs under restrictions on the qubits connectivities, justified by different quantum computer architectures. We apply the expressibility quantifier and the average entanglement as diagnostics for the characteristics of the generated states and classify the circuits depending on the topology of the quantum computer where they can be implemented. As a function of the number of layers and qubits, circuits following a Ring topology will have the highest entanglement and expressibility values, followed by Linear/All-to-all almost together and the Star topology. In addition to the characterization of the differences between the entanglement and expressibility of these circuits, we also place a connection between how steep is the increase on the uniformity of the distribution of the generated states and the generation of entanglement. Circuits generating average and standard deviation for entanglement closer to values obtained with the truly uniformly random ensemble of unitaries present a steeper evolution when compared to others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models aim to learn the underlying distribution of the data in order to generate new samples. Quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) are a popular choice of quantum generative models, which are particularly well suited to near-term devices since they can be implemented on shallow circuits. Within the framework of photonic quantum computing, we design and simulate a QCBM that can be implemented with linear optics. We show that a newly developed error mitigation technique called recycling mitigation greatly improves the training of QCBMs in realistic scenarios with photon loss.</description>

We present a family of techniques to mitigate the effects of photon loss on both output probabilities and expectation values derived from noisy linear optical circuits composed of an input of $n$ photons, an $m$-mode interferometer, and $m$ single photon detectors. Central to these techniques is the construction of objects called recycled probabilities. Recycled probabilities are constructed from output statistics affected by loss, and are designed to amplify the signal of the ideal (lossless) probabilities. Classical postprocessing techniques then take recycled probabilities as input and output a set of loss-mitigated probabilities, or expectation values. We provide analytical and numerical evidence that these methods can be applied, up to large sample sizes, to produce more accurate outputs than those obtained from postselection - which is currently the standard method of coping with photon loss when sampling from discrete variable linear optical quantum circuits. In contrast, we provide strong evidence that the popular zero noise extrapolation technique cannot improve on on the performance of postselection for any photon loss rate.</description>

      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in quasiperiodically disordered chains from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian flow in one-dimensional PT-symmetric quantum criticalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical point of a topological phase transition is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), where the finite-size corrections to the ground state energy are uniquely related to its central charge. We study the finite-size scaling of the energy of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with parity and time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that under open boundary condition (OBC), the energy scaling $E(L)\sim c/L$ reveals a negative central charge $c=-2$ at the non-Hermitian critical point, indicative of a non-unitary CFT. Furthermore, we discover a universal scaling function capturing the flow of a system from Dirac CFT with $c=1$ to a non-unitary CFT with $c=-2$. The scaling function demonstrates distinct behaviors at topologically non-trivial and trivial sides of critical points. Notably, within the realm of topological criticality, the scaling function exhibits an universal rise-dip-rise pattern, manifesting a characteristic singularity inherent in the non-Hermitian topological critical points. The analytic expression of the scaling function has been derived and is in good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor in chaotic, localized, and integrable open quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the spectral statistics of open quantum many-body systems (OQMBS) as signatures of quantum chaos (or the lack thereof), using the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), a generalization of the spectral form factor to complex spectra. We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically displays the $\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau behaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in the presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a time scale $\tau_{\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size for sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian analogue of the $\textit{many-body Thouless time}$. The universality of the random matrix theory behavior is demonstrated by surveying twelve models of OQMBS, including random Kraus circuits (quantum channels) and random Lindbladians (Liouvillians) in several symmetry classes, as well as Lindbladians of paradigmatic models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), XXZ, and the transverse field Ising models. We devise an unfolding and filtering procedure to remove variations of the averaged density of states which would otherwise hide the universal RMT-like signatures in the DSFF for chaotic OQMBS. Beyond chaotic OQMBS, we study the spectral statistics of non-chaotic OQMBS, specifically the integrable XX model and a system in the many-body localized (MBL) regime in the presence of dissipation, which exhibit DSFF behaviours distinct from the ramp-plateau behaviour of random matrix theory. Lastly, we study the DSFF of Lindbladians with the Hamiltonian term set to zero, i.e. only the jump operators are present, and demonstrate that the results of RMT universality and scaling of many-body Thouless time survive even without coherent evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study universal chaotic dynamics of a large class of periodically driven critical systems described by spatially inhomogeneous conformal field theories. By employing an effective curved spacetime approach, we show that the onset of quantum chaotic correlations, captured by the Lyapunov exponent of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), is set by the Hawking temperature of emergent Floquet horizons. Furthermore, scrambling of quantum information is shown to be strongly inhomogeneous, leading to transitions from chaotic to non-chaotic regimes by tuning driving parameters. We finally use our framework to propose a concrete protocol to simulate and measure OTOCs in quantum simulators, by designing an efficient stroboscopic backward time evolution.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian wave packet dynamics: a critical assessment of three propagation schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assessed three schemes for propagating a variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wave packet moving under the influence of Morse or double-well potentials with parameters that are chemically representative. The most rigorous scheme is based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP); it leads to realistic behaviour of the center and width of a wave packet in all investigated regimes. Two other approximate schemes, Heller's and the extended semiclassical ones, demonstrate various aberrations. Heller's scheme does not properly account for various zero-point energy-related effects, is unable to predict tunneling, and more importantly, exhibits completely nonphysical unbound width oscillations. The extended semiclassical scheme, which was developed to address some of the shortcomings of the Heller counterpart, demonstrates another unphysical behaviour: self-trapping of a trajectory in both Morse and double-well potentials. We conclude that only the TDVP-based scheme is suitable for problem-free dynamical simulations. This, however, raises the question of how to utilize it efficiently in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Features of the Fourth Order Irreducible Correlations in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding high-order correlations or multi-particle entities in a many-body system is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics, but also critical for many technological applications. So far, higher-order multi-particle irreducible correlations in semiconductors have not been studied beyond the second-order or two-particle case. In this paper, we study the correlation of two electrons and two holes (2e2h) using the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation (4B-BSE) and applied to the calculation of the helicity-resolved absorption between the two-body and four-body states for a monolayer MoTe2. Surprisingly, we found a rich series of spectral peaks within an energy span of ~40 meV below the exciton that has not been seen before. To understand the origin of the new spectral peaks, the Feynman diagrams of the 4B BSE are recast into the cluster expansion formalism, allowing us to study the individual effects of selected clusters or correlations of various orders. We found that the irreducible clusters of orders up to the 3rd and their factorized combinations cannot explain the spectral features. Importantly, we found that the 4th order irreducible correlation is necessary and sufficient to explain the new features. The 4th order irreducible correlation corresponds to a four-particle irreducible cluster involving two electrons and two holes, alternatively called quadron or quadruplon. The new 4th order correlation or four-particle entity not only enriches our understanding of many-body correlations but also could provide new mechanism for light emission or absorption for possible new optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Configurational Spectral Splitting between Trion and Charged Exciton in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body electron-hole complexes in a semiconductor are important both from a fundamental physics point of view and for practical device applications. A three-body system of electrons (e) and holes (h) (2e1h, or 1e2h) in a two-band semiconductor is commonly believed to be associated with two spectral peaks for the exciton and trion (or charged exciton), respectively. But both the validity of this understanding and the physical meaning of a trion or charged exciton have not been thoroughly examined. From the physics point of view, there are two different configurations, (e)(eh) or (eeh), which could be considered charged exciton and trion, respectively. Here (...) represents an irreducible cluster with respect to Coulomb interactions. In this paper, we consider these issues related to the 2e1h three-body problem theoretically and experimentally using monolayer MoTe2 as an example. Our theoretical tools involve the three-body Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and the cluster expansion technique, especially their correspondence. Experimentally, we measure the photoluminescence spectrum on a gate-controlled monolayer MoTe2. We found two spectral peaks that are 21 and 4 meV, respectively, below the exciton peak, in contrast to the single "trion" peak from the conventional understanding. We show that, while the three-body BSE in a two-band model can reproduce all spectral features, the cluster-expansion technique shows that the two peaks correspond to the charged exciton (e)(eh) and trion (eeh), respectively. In other words, there is a spectral splitting due to the two different many-body configurations. Furthermore, we find that the trion only exists in the intervalley case, while the charged exciton exists both for the intervalley and intravalley cases.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum information analysis of vibrational wave functions to understand complex vibrational spectra of molecules with strong anharmonic couplings and vibrational resonances. For this purpose, we define one- and two-modal entropies to guide the identification of strongly coupled vibrational modes and to characterize correlations within modal basis sets. We evaluate these descriptors for multi-configurational vibrational wave functions which we calculate with the n-mode vibrational density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies. We investigate the entanglement signature of the Fermi resonance and discuss the maximally entangled state arising from the two degenerate bending modes.</description>

Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method accurate down to a single-photon level that provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of a biological specimen. Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric microresonators are indispensable in wireless communications, and underpin radio frequency filtering in mobile phones. These devices are usually analyzed in the quasi-(electro)static regime with the magnetic field effectively ignored. On the other hand, at GHz frequencies and especially in piezoelectric devices exploiting strong dimensional confinement of acoustic fields, the surface magnetic fields ($B_{1}$) can be significant. This $B_1$ field, which oscillates at GHz frequencies, but is confined to ${\mu}$m-scale wavelengths provides a natural route to efficiently interface with nanoscale spin systems. We show through scaling arguments that $B_1{\propto}f^2$ for tightly focused acoustic fields at a given operation frequency $f$. We demonstrate the existence of these surface magnetic fields in a proof-of-principle experiment by showing excess power absorption at the focus of a surface acoustic wave (SAW), when a polished Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) sphere is positioned in the evanescent field, and the magnon resonance is tuned across the SAW transmission. Finally, we outline the prospects for sensitive spin detection using small mode volume piezoelectric microresonators, including the feasibility of electrical detection of single spins at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Recently a certain thought experiment was discussed which involves the decoherence of a quantum system due to a black hole. Here we show how this phenomenon is consistent with standard ideas about quantum black holes. In other words, modeling the black hole as a quantum system at finite temperature one obtains the same answer. We demonstrate this by analyzing the problem in terms of an effective theory that can apply both for the black hole case and for an ordinary matter system, showing that the same qualitative effect is present for ordinary matter at finite temperature.</description>

Abstract: Studying the response of quantum systems is essential for gaining deeper insights into the fundamental nature of matter and its behavior in diverse physical contexts. Computation of nuclear response is critical for many applications, but its spectroscopically accurate description in medium-heavy nuclei in wide energy ranges remains particularly challenging because of the complex nature of nuclear quantum states in the high-level-density regime. Herein, we push the limits of configuration complexity in the classical computation of the nuclear response and present an algorithm with a quantum benefit for treating complex configurations. The classical computational method of approaching spectroscopic accuracy is implemented for medium-heavy nuclei and pioneered for the dipole response of 120Sn, while the quantum algorithm reaching the exact solution is realized for the Lipkin Hamiltonian to unravel the emergence of collectivity at strong coupling.</description>

Abstract: According to relativity, the reading of an ideal clock is interpreted as the elapsed proper time along its classical trajectory through spacetime. In contrast, quantum theory allows the association of many simultaneous trajectories with a single quantum clock, each weighted appropriately. Here, we investigate how the superposition principle affects the gravitational time dilation observed by a simple clock - a decaying two-level atom. Placing such an atom in a superposition of positions enables us to analyze a quantum contribution to a classical time dilation manifest in spontaneous emission. In particular, we show that the emission rate of an atom prepared in a coherent superposition of separated wave packets in a gravitational field is different from the emission rate of an atom in a classical mixture of these packets, which gives rise to a quantum gravitational time dilation effect. We demonstrate that this nonclassical effect also manifests in a fractional frequency shift of the internal energy of the atom that is within the resolution of current atomic clocks. In addition, we show the effect of spatial coherence on the atom's emission spectrum.</description>

      <title>Unifying Quantum Verification and Error-Detection: Theory and Tools for Optimisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of cloud-based quantum computing, it has become vital to provide strong guarantees that computations delegated by clients to quantum service providers have been executed faithfully. Secure - blind and verifiable - Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) has emerged as one of the key approaches to address this challenge, yet current protocols lack at least one of the following three ingredients: composability, noise-robustness and modularity.
  To tackle this question, our paper lays out the fundamental structure of SDQC protocols, namely mixing two components: the computation which the client would like the server to perform and tests that are designed to detect a server's malicious behaviour. Using this abstraction, our main technical result is a set of sufficient conditions on these components which imply the security and noise-robustness of generic SDQC protocols in the composable Abstract Cryptography framework. This is done by establishing a correspondence between these security properties and the error-detection capabilities of the test computations. Changing the types of tests and how they are mixed with the client's computation automatically yields new SDQC protocols with different security and noise-robustness capabilities.
  This approach thereby provides the desired modularity as our sufficient conditions on test computations simplify the steps required to prove the security of the protocols and allows to focus on the design and optimisation of test rounds to specific situations. We showcase this by systematising the search for improved SDQC protocols for Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial-time computations. The resulting protocols do not require more hardware on the server's side than what is necessary to blindly delegate the computation without verification, and they outperform all previously known results.</description>

Abstract: The use of ancillary quantum systems known as catalysts is known to be able to enhance the capabilities of entanglement transformations under local operations and classical communication. However, the limits of these advantages have not been determined, and in particular it is not known if such assistance can overcome the known restrictions on asymptotic transformation rates -- notably the existence of bound entangled (undistillable) states. Here we establish a general limitation of entanglement catalysis: we show that catalytic transformations can never allow for the distillation of entanglement from a bound entangled state with positive partial transpose, even if the catalyst may become correlated with the system of interest, and even under permissive choices of free operations. This precludes the possibility that catalysis can make entanglement theory asymptotically reversible. Our methods are based on new asymptotic bounds for the distillable entanglement and entanglement cost assisted by correlated catalysts.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Design and Realization of Alternative Superconducting Quantum Architectures</title>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum hardware architectures have been designed by considering the physical constraints of the underlying physics. These general-purpose architectures leave room for customization and optimization that can be exploited with alternative architectures specific to the quantum applications that will be executed on the quantum hardware. However, the corresponding design steps are hardly integrated yet and still rely heavily on manual labor. In this work, we provide a software framework that aims at providing a foundation to address this drawback. To this end, we first review the design of superconducting quantum hardware architectures and, afterwards, propose a cohesive framework encapsulating the design flow of an application-specific quantum hardware architecture. The resulting framework integrates high-level architecture generation optimized for a quantum application, the physical layout of the architecture, as well as optimization of the layout in a methodical manner. The framework with a reference implementation is available via https://github.com/cda-tum/dasqa under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on anomalous energy flows in correlated quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical thermodynamics energy always flows from the hotter system to the colder one. However, if these systems are initially correlated, the energy flow can reverse, making the cold system colder and the hot system hotter. This intriguing phenomenon is called ``anomalous energy flow'' and shows the importance of initial correlations in determining physical properties of thermodynamic systems. Here we investigate the fundamental limits of this effect. Specifically, we find the optimal amount of energy that can be transferred between quantum systems under closed and reversible dynamics, which then allows us to characterize the anomalous energy flow. We then explore a more general scenario where the energy flow is mediated by an ancillary quantum system that acts as a catalyst. We show that this approach allows for exploiting previously inaccessible types of correlations, ultimately resulting in an energy transfer that surpasses our fundamental bound. To demonstrate these findings, we use a well-studied quantum optics setup involving two atoms coupled to an optical cavity.</description>

      <title>Probing single electrons across 300 mm spin qubit wafers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require vast numbers of physical qubits. For qubit technologies based on solid state electronic devices, integrating millions of qubits in a single processor will require device fabrication to reach a scale comparable to that of the modern CMOS industry. Equally importantly, the scale of cryogenic device testing must keep pace to enable efficient device screening and to improve statistical metrics like qubit yield and voltage variation. Spin qubits based on electrons in Si have shown impressive control fidelities but have historically been challenged by yield and process variation. Here we present a testing process using a cryogenic 300 mm wafer prober to collect high-volume data on the performance of hundreds of industry-manufactured spin qubit devices at 1.6 K. This testing method provides fast feedback to enable optimization of the CMOS-compatible fabrication process, leading to high yield and low process variation. Using this system, we automate measurements of the operating point of spin qubits and probe the transitions of single electrons across full wafers. We analyze the random variation in single-electron operating voltages and find that the optimized fabrication process leads to low levels of disorder at the 300 mm scale. Together these results demonstrate the advances that can be achieved through the application of CMOS industry techniques to the fabrication and measurement of spin qubit devices.</description>

Abstract: Shortening quantum circuits is crucial to reducing the destructive effect of environmental decoherence and enabling useful algorithms. Here, we demonstrate an improvement in such compilation tasks via a combination of using hybrid discrete-continuous optimization across a continuous gate set, and architecture-tailored implementation. The continuous parameters are discovered with a gradient-based optimization algorithm, while in tandem the optimal gate orderings are learned via a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on projective simulation. To test this approach, we introduce a framework to simulate collective gates in trapped-ion systems efficiently on a classical device. The algorithm proves able to significantly reduce the size of relevant quantum circuits for trapped-ion computing. Furthermore, we show that our framework can also be applied to an experimental setup whose goal is to reproduce an unknown unitary process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied geometric quantum speed limits (QSL) of a qubit subject to decoherence in an ensemble of chloroform molecules in a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment. The QSL is a fundamental lower bound on the evolution time for quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. To do so, we controlled the system-reservoir interaction and the spin relaxation rates by adding a paramagnetic salt, which allowed us to observe both Markovian and non-Markovian open system dynamics for the qubit. We used two distinguishability measures of quantum states to assess the speed of the qubit evolution: the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WY). For non-Markovian dynamics and low salt concentrations, we observed crossovers between QSLs related to the QFI and WY metrics. The WY metric sets the tighter QSL for high concentrations and Markovian dynamics. We also show that QSLs are sensitive even to small fluctuations in spin magnetization.</description>

      <title>Decoding algorithms for surface codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14989v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies have the potential to solve certain computationally hard problems with polynomial or super-polynomial speedups when compared to classical methods. Unfortunately, the unstable nature of quantum information makes it prone to errors. For this reason, quantum error correction is an invaluable tool to make quantum information reliable and enable the ultimate goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes currently stand as the most promising candidates to build near term error corrected qubits given their two-dimensional architecture, the requirement of only local operations, and high tolerance to quantum noise. Decoding algorithms are an integral component of any error correction scheme, as they are tasked with producing accurate estimates of the errors that affect quantum information, so that they can subsequently be corrected. A critical aspect of decoding algorithms is their speed, since the quantum state will suffer additional errors with the passage of time. This poses a connundrum, where decoding performance is improved at the expense of complexity and viceversa. In this review, a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for surface codes is provided. The target audience of this work are both readers with an introductory understanding of the field as well as those seeking to further their knowledge of the decoding paradigm of surface codes. We describe the core principles of these decoding methods as well as existing variants that show promise for improved results. In addition, both the decoding performance, in terms of error correction capability, and decoding complexity, are compared. A review of the existing software tools regarding surface codes decoding is also provided</description>

Abstract: Many quantum algorithms rely on the measurement of complex quantum amplitudes. Standard approaches to obtain the phase information, such as the Hadamard test, give rise to large overheads due to the need for global controlled-unitary operations. We introduce a quantum algorithm based on complex analysis that overcomes this problem for amplitudes that are a continuous function of time. Our method only requires the implementation of real-time evolution and a shallow circuit that approximates a short imaginary-time evolution. We show that the method outperforms the Hadamard test in terms of circuit depth and that it is suitable for current noisy quantum computers when combined with a simple error-mitigation strategy.</description>

      <title>How to Use Quantum Indistinguishability Obfuscation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum copy protection, introduced by Aaronson, enables giving out a quantum program-description that cannot be meaningfully duplicated. Despite over a decade of study, copy protection is only known to be possible for a very limited class of programs. As our first contribution, we show how to achieve "best-possible" copy protection for all programs. We do this by introducing quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation (qsiO), a notion of obfuscation for quantum descriptions of classical programs. We show that applying qsiO to a program immediately achieves best-possible copy protection. Our second contribution is to show that, assuming injective one-way functions exist, qsiO is concrete copy protection for a large family of puncturable programs -- significantly expanding the class of copy-protectable programs. A key tool in our proof is a new variant of unclonable encryption (UE) that we call coupled unclonable encryption (cUE). While constructing UE in the standard model remains an important open problem, we are able to build cUE from one-way functions. If we additionally assume the existence of UE, then we can further expand the class of puncturable programs for which qsiO is copy protection. Finally, we construct qsiO relative to an efficient quantum oracle.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this letter, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against data perturbations. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly involves the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings, as those frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of local decoherence on a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. Mapping the 2D cluster state under decoherence to a classical spin model, we show a topological phase transition of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(0)}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(1)}$ SPT phase into the trivial phase occurring at a finite decoherence strength. To characterize the phase transition, we employ three distinct diagnostic methods, namely, the relative entropy between two decohered SPT states with different topological edge states, the strange correlation function of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}$ charge, and the multipartite negativity of the mixed state on a disk. All the diagnostics can be obtained as certain thermodynamic quantities in the corresponding classical model, and the results of three diagnostic tests are consistent with each other. Given that the 2D cluster state possesses universal computational capabilities in the context of measurement-based quantum computation, the topological phase transition found here can also be interpreted as a transition in the computational power.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metrology explores quantum effects to improve the measurement accuracy of some physical quantities beyond the classical limit. However, due to the interaction between the system and the environment, the decoherence can significantly reduce the accuracy of the measurement. Many methods have been proposed to restore the accuracy of the measurement in the long-time limit. Recently, it has been found that the bound state can assist the error-free measurement and recover the $t^{-1}$ scaling [K. Bai, Z. Peng, H. G. Luo, and J. H. An, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 040402 (2019)]. Here, by using $N$-qubits, we propose a method to simulate the open quantum dynamics of the hybrid system including one atom and coupled resonators. We find that the error of the measurement can vanish as the time increases due to the existence of the bound state. By both analytical and numerical simulations, we prove the $t^{-1}$ scaling of the measurement error can be recovered when there is a bound state in the hybrid system. Interestingly, we observe that there are perfect oscillations which can be used for the evaluation of the atomic transition frequency. For a finite-$N$, the duration of the perfect oscillations doubles as one more qubit is involved.</description>

Abstract: We show via explicit construction that all the extreme rays of both the three-party quantum entropy cone and the four-party stabilizer entropy cone can be obtained from subsystem coarse grainings of specific higher-party quantum states, namely extreme states characterized by saturating a (non-trivial) maximal set of instances of subadditivity. This suggests that the study of the ``subadditivity cone'', and the set of its extreme rays realizable in quantum mechanics, provides a powerful tool for deriving inner bounds for the quantum and stabilizer entropy cones, as well as constraints on new inequalities for the von Neumann entropy.</description>

Abstract: Controlled operations are fundamental building blocks of quantum algorithms. Decomposing $n$-control-NOT gates ($C^n(X)$) into arbitrary single-qubit and CNOT gates, is a crucial but non-trivial task. This study introduces $C^n(X)$ circuits outperforming previous methods in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes. Three distinct decompositions are presented: an exact one using one borrowed ancilla with a circuit depth $\Theta\left(\log(n)^{3}\right)$, an approximating one without ancilla qubits with a circuit depth $\mathcal O \left(\log(n)^{3}\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ and an exact one with an adjustable-depth circuit which decreases with the number $m\leq n$ of ancilla qubits available as $O(log(2n/m)^3+log(m/2))$. The resulting exponential speedup is likely to have a substantial impact on fault-tolerant quantum computing by improving the complexities of countless quantum algorithms with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to physics, finance and quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dimensionality of bipartite quantum systems through the construction of a device-independent null witness test. This test assesses whether a given bipartite state conforms with the expected quantum dimension, Schmidt rank, and also distinguishes between real and complex spaces. By employing local measurements on each party, the proposed method aims to determine the minimal rank. By performing an experimental demonstration on IBM Quantum devices, we prove the exceptional accuracy of the test and its usefulness in diagnostics beyond routine calibrations.
  One of tests shows agreement with theoretical expectations within statistical errors. However, the second test failed by more than 6 standard deviations, indicating unspecified parasitic entanglements, with no known simple origin.</description>

      <title>Device-independent certification of desirable properties with a confidence interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the development of quantum technologies, a reliable means for characterizing quantum devices is crucial. However, the conventional approach based on, e.g., quantum state tomography or process tomography relies on assumptions often not necessarily justifiable in a realistic experimental setting. While the device-independent approach to this problem bypasses the shortcomings above by making only minimal, justifiable assumptions, most of the theoretical proposals to date only work in the idealized setting where i.i.d. trials are assumed. Here, we provide a versatile solution for rigorous device-independent certification that does not rely on the i.i.d. assumption. Specifically, we describe how the prediction-based-ratio (PBR) protocol and martingale-based protocol developed for hypothesis testing can be applied in the present context to achieve a device-independent certification of desirable properties with confidence interval. To illustrate the versatility of these methods, we demonstrate how we can use them to certify, with finite data, the underlying negativity, Hilbert space dimension, entanglement depth, and fidelity to some target pure state. In particular, we give examples showing how the amount of certifiable negativity and fidelity scales with the number of trials, and how many experimental trials one needs to certify a qutrit state space, or the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement. Overall, we have found that the PBR protocol and the martingale-based protocol often offer similar performance, even though the former does have to presuppose any witness. In contrast, our findings also show that the performance of the martingale-based protocol may be severely affected by one's choice of the witness. Intriguingly, a witness useful for self-testing does not necessarily give the optimal confidence-gain rate for certifying the fidelity to the corresponding target state.</description>

Abstract: We develop an efficient method for certifying single-qubit quantum gates in a black-box scenario, assuming only the dimension of the quantum system is known. The method is based on testing the outcomes of exact quantum computations on a single qubit, with no auxiliary systems required. We prove that the method's sample complexity grows as $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ with respect to the average gate infidelity $\varepsilon$ for the certification of a relevant single-qubit gate, which experimentally corresponds to a $\pi/2$-pulse. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be used to certify a gate set universal for single-qubit quantum computation. Our approach takes a first step in bridging the gap between strong notions of certification from self-testing and practically highly relevant approaches from quantum system characterization.</description>

Abstract: Typical measures of nonstabilizerness of a system of $N$ qubits require computing $4^N$ expectation values, one for each Pauli string in the Pauli group, over a state of dimension $2^N$. For permutationally invariant systems, this exponential overhead can be reduced to just $O(N^3)$ expectation values on a state with a dimension $O(N)$. We exploit this simplification to study the nonstabilizerness phase transitions of systems with hundreds of qubits.</description>

      <title>Experimental lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a it $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We show several examples for which, in good approximation, $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ with a constant of proportionality slightly larger than one. We argue that one should have the inequality $S_{A}^{vN}\geq(2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ holding in more general circumstances. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Near-ultrastrong nonlinear light-matter coupling in superconducting circuits</title>

Abstract: The interaction between an atom and an electromagnetic mode of a resonator is of both fundamental interest and is ubiquitous in quantum technologies. Most prior work studies a linear light-matter coupling of the form $g \widehat{\sigma}_x (\widehat{a} + \widehat{a}^\dagger)$, where $g$ measured relative to photonic ($\omega_a$) and atomic ($\omega_b$) mode frequencies can reach the ultrastrong regime ($g/\omega_{a}\!&gt;\!10^{-1}$). In contrast, a nonlinear light-matter coupling of the form $\frac{\chi}{2} \widehat{\sigma}_z \widehat{a}^\dagger \widehat{a}$ has the advantage of commuting with the atomic $\widehat{\sigma}_z$ and photonic $\widehat{a}^\dagger\widehat{a}$ Hamiltonian, allowing for fundamental operations such as quantum-non-demolition measurement. However, due to the perturbative nature of nonlinear coupling, the state-of-the-art $\chi/\text{max}(\omega_a, \omega_b)$ is limited to $\!&lt;\!10^{-2}$. Here, we use a superconducting circuit architecture featuring a quarton coupler to experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a near-ultrastrong $\chi/\text{max}(\omega_a, \omega_b)= (4.852\pm0.006)\times10^{-2}$ nonlinear coupling of a superconducting artificial atom and a nearly-linear resonator. We also show signatures of light-light nonlinear coupling ($\chi\widehat{a}^\dagger\widehat{a}\widehat{b}^\dagger\widehat{b}$), and $\chi/2\pi = 580.3 \pm 0.4 $ MHz matter-matter nonlinear coupling ($\frac{\chi}{4}\widehat{\sigma}_{z,a}\widehat{\sigma}_{z,b}$) which represents the largest reported $ZZ$ interaction between two coherent qubits. Such advances in the nonlinear coupling strength of light, matter modes enable new physical regimes and could lead to applications such as orders of magnitude faster qubit readout and gates.</description>

Abstract: Different kinds of wave packet transforms are widely used for extracting multi-scale structures in signal processing tasks. This paper introduces the quantum circuit implementation of a broad class of wave packets, including Gabor atoms and wavelets, with compact frequency support. Our approach operates in the frequency space, involving reallocation and reshuffling of signals tailored for manipulation on quantum computers. The resulting implementation is different from the existing quantum algorithms for spatially compactly supported wavelets and can be readily extended to quantum transforms of other wave packets with compact frequency support.</description>

Abstract: Subtracting accidental coincidences is a common practice quantum optics experiments. For zero mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed vacuum, we show that if one removes accidental coincidences the measurement results are quantitatively the same, both for photon coincidences at very low flux and for intensity covariances. Consequently, pure quantum effects at the photon level, like interference of photon wave functions or photon bunching, are reproduced in the correlation of fluctuations of macroscopic beams issued from spontaneous down conversion. This is true both in experiment if the detection resolution is smaller than the coherence cell (size of the mode), and in stochastic simulations based on sampling the Wigner function. We discuss the limitations of this correspondence, such as Bell inequalities (for which one cannot substract accidental coincidences), highly multimode situations such as quantum imaging, and higher order correlations.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Rubidium-Assisted Electron Capture by Barium (II) Cation</title>

Abstract: Non-local energy transfer between bound electronic states close to the ionisation threshold is employed for efficient state preparation in dilute atom systems from technological foundations to quantum computing. The generalisation to electronic transitions into and out of the continuum is lacking quantum simulations necessary to motivate such potential experiments. Here, we present the first development of a electron-dynamical model simulating fully three-dimensional atomic systems for this purpose. We investigate the viability of this model for the prototypical case of recombination of ultracold barium(II) by environment-assisted electron capture thanks to a rubidium atom in its vicinity. Both atomic sites are modelled as effective one-electron systems using the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm and can transfer energy by dipole-dipole interaction. We find that the simulations are robust enough to realise assisted capture over a dilute interatomic distance which we are able to quantify by comparing to simulations without interatomic energy exchange. For our current parameters not yet optimised for reaction likelihood, an environment-ionising assisted capture has a probability of $1.9\times10^{-5}~\%$ over the first $15~\mathrm{fs}$ of the simulation. The environment-exciting assisted-capture path to $[\text{Ba}^{+*}\text{Rb}^{*}]$ appears as a stable long-lived intermediate state with a probability of $8.2\times10^{-4}~\%$ for at least $20~\mathrm{fs}$ after the capture has been completed. This model shows potential to predict optimised parameters as well as to accommodate the conditions present in experimental systems as closely as possible. We put the presented setup forward as a suitable first step to experimentally realise environment-assisted electron capture with current existing technologies.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Tame Quantum Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the notion that physical systems can contain only a finite amount of information or complexity, we introduce a framework that allows for quantifying the amount of logical information needed to specify a function or set. We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity between separated regions in quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behavior, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalizes the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>

      <title>Regularized relativistic corrections for polyelectronic and polyatomic systems with explicitly correlated Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drachmann's regularization approach is implemented for floating explicitly correlated Gaussians (fECGs) and molecular systems. Earlier applications of drachmannized relativistic corrections for molecular systems were hindered due to the unknown analytic matrix elements of $1/r_{ix}1/r_{jy}$-type operators with fECGs. In the present work, one of the $1/r$ factors is approximated by a linear combination of Gaussians, which results in calculable integrals. The numerical approach is found to be precise and robust over a range of molecular systems and nuclear configurations, and thus, it opens the route towards an automated evaluation of high-precision relativistic corrections over potential energy surfaces of polyatomic systems. Furthermore, the newly developed integration approach makes it possible to construct the matrix representation of the square of the electronic Hamiltonian relevant for energy lower-bound as well as time-dependent computations of molecular systems with a flexible and high-precision fECG basis representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>
