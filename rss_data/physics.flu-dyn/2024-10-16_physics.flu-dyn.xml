      <title>Pathways from nucleation to raindrops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud droplets grow via vapor condensation and collisional aggregation. Upon reaching approximately $\approx 100~{\rm \mu m}$, their inertia allows them to capture smaller droplets during descent, initiating rain. Here, we show that raindrop formation is not primarily governed by gravity or thermal diffusion, but by a critical range of drop sizes ($3-30~{\rm \mu m}$) where collisions are largely ineffective and controlled by van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. We identify four pathways to rain. The coalescence pathway, which is slow, involves the broadening of the drop size distribution across the $3-30~{\rm \mu m}$ low-efficiency gap through collisions, until enough large individual droplets achieving efficient collisions have formed. The mixing pathway, which is faster, requires mixing at the cloud top with drop-free, cold, humid air to create locally supersaturated conditions that grow droplets above the low-efficiency gap. The electrostatic pathway bypasses the gap through a static vertical field creating attractive interactions between droplets. The turbulence pathway relies on air turbulence to bring the droplets together at an increased rate, but we show that this pathway is unlikely. For all dynamical mechanisms, we demonstrate that the initiation time for rainfall occurs at the crossover between the broadening of the drop size distribution and the emergence of individual droplets large enough to trigger the onset of the rainfall cascade.</description>

      <title>Deformation and breakup of a ferrofluid compound droplet migrating in a microchannel under a magnetic field: A phase-field-based multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous in many engineering applications, including drug delivery, the compound droplet hydrodynamics in confined geometries have been barely surveyed. For the first time, this study thoroughly investigates the hydrodynamics of a ferrofluid compound droplet (FCD) during its migration in a microchannel under the presence of a pressure-driven flow and a uniform external magnetic field (UEMF) to manipulate its morphology and retard its breakup. Finite difference and phase-field multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann approaches are coupled to determine the magnetic field and ternary flow system, respectively. Firstly, the influence of the magnetic Bond number (Bo) on the FCD morphology is explored depending on whether the core or shell is ferrofluid when the UEMF is applied along {\alpha}=0{\deg} and {\alpha}=90{\deg} relative to the fluid flow. It is ascertained that imposing the UEMF at {\alpha}=0{\deg} when the shell is ferrofluid can postpone the breakup. Intriguingly, when the core is ferrofluid, strengthening the UEMF enlarges the shell deformation. Afterward, the effects of the Capillary number (Ca), density ratio, viscosity ratio, radius ratio, and surface tension coefficients are scrutinized on the FCD deformation and breakup. The results indicate that augmenting the core-to-shell viscosity and density ratios accelerates the breakup process. Additionally, surface tension between the core and shell suppresses the core deformation. Moreover, increasing the Ca number intensifies the viscous drag force exerted on the shell, flattening its rear side, which causes a triangular-like configuration. Ultimately, by varying Bo and Ca numbers, five distinguished regimes are observed, whose regime map is established.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic coupling of a cilia--mucus system in Herschel--Bulkley flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yield stress and shear thinning properties of mucus are identified as critical for ciliary coordination and mucus transport in human airways. We use here numerical simulations to explore the hydrodynamic coupling of cilia and mucus with these two properties using the Herschel--Bulkley model, in a lattice Boltzmann solver for the fluid flow. Three mucus flow regimes, i.e. a poorly organized regime, a swirly regime, and a fully unidirectional regime, are observed and analysed by parametric studies. We systematically investigate the effects of ciliary density, interaction length, Bingham number and flow index on the mucus flow regime formation. The underlying mechanism of the regime formation is analysed in detail by examining the variation of two physical quantities (polarization and integral length) and the evolution of the flow velocity, viscosity and shear-rate fields. Mucus viscosity is found to be the dominant parameter influencing the regime formation when enhancing the yield stress and shear thinning properties. The present model is able to reproduce the solid body rotation observed in experiments (Loiseau et al. , Nat. Phys. , vol. 16, 2020, pp. 1158--1164). A more precise prediction can be achieved by incorporating non-Newtonian properties into the modelling of mucus as proposed by Gsell et al. ( Sci. Rep. , vol. 10, 2020, 8405).</description>

      <title>Comprehensive linear stability analysis for intrinsic instabilities in premixed ammonia/hydrogen/air flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of planar laminar premixed ammonia/hydrogen/air flames are conducted for a wide range of equivalence ratios, hydrogen ($\rm H_2$) fractions in the fuel blend, pressures, and unburned temperatures to study intrinsic flame instabilities (IFIs) in the linear regime. For stoichiometric and lean mixtures at ambient conditions, a non-monotonic behavior of thermo-diffusive instabilities with increasing ($\rm H_2$) fraction is observed. Strongest instabilities occur for molar ($\rm H_2$) fractions of 40%. The analysis shows that this behavior is linked to the joint effect of variations of the effective Lewis number and Zeldovich number. IFIs in ammonia/hydrogen blends further show a non-monotonic trend with respect to pressure, which is found to be linked to the chemistry of the hydroperoxyl radical $\rm HO_2$. The addition of $\rm NH_3$ opens new reaction pathways for the consumption of $\rm HO_2$ resulting in a chain carrying behavior in contrast to its chain terminating nature in pure $\rm H_2$/air flames. Theoretically derived dispersion relations can predict the non-monotonic behavior for lean conditions. However, these are found to be sensitive to the different methods for evaluating the Zeldovich number available in the literature.</description>

      <title>AI-driven random walk simulations of viscophoresis and visco-diffusiophoretic particle trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscophoresis refers to the transport of suspended nanoparticles driven by a steep viscosity gradient of. This work investigates this new transport effect using a random walk simulation. By modelling position-dependent Brownian motion, viscophoresis, and diffusiophoresis in a one-dimensional geometry, the simulates yields results that align well with experimental data, demonstrating viscophoresis as a new phoretic transport mechanism. Additionally, the simulation predicts the efficient separation of nanoparticles based on size, suggesting potential applications for sorting in microfluidic systems. The Python script for the simulation was generated using ChatGPT o1, significantly accelerating model development and providing accurate physical insights and efficient equations. However, caution is advised, as ChatGPT may generate non-physical results; iterative testing and validation is important.</description>

      <title>A homogenised model for dispersive transport and sorption in a heterogeneous porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealised microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenisation to examine this dependence, but strongly heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenisation via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving non-periodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterised by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.</description>

      <title>Hypercomplex Dynamics and Turbulent Flows in Sobolev and Besov Functional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous study of advanced functional spaces, with a focus on Sobolev and Besov spaces, to investigate key aspects of fluid dynamics, including the regularity of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, hypercomplex bifurcations, and turbulence. We offer a comprehensive analysis of Sobolev embedding theorems in fractional spaces and apply bifurcation theory within quaternionic dynamical systems to better understand the complex behaviors in fluid systems. Additionally, the research delves into energy dissipation mechanisms in turbulent flows through the framework of Besov spaces. Key mathematical tools, such as interpolation theory, Littlewood-Paley decomposition, and energy cascade models, are integrated to develop a robust theoretical approach to these problems. By addressing challenges related to the existence and smoothness of solutions, this work contributes to the ongoing exploration of the open Navier-Stokes problem, providing new insights into the intricate relationship between fluid dynamics and functional spaces.</description>

      <title>Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order modeling using stable learned differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) are essential for dynamics prediction in multi-query applications where access to the source of the underlying full order model (FOM) is unavailable; that is, FOM is a black-box. This article proposes a learn-then-project approach for nonintrusive model reduction. In the first step of this approach, high-dimensional stable sparse learned differential operators (S-LDOs) are determined using the generated data. In the second step, the ordinary differential equations, comprising these S-LDOs, are used with suitable dimensionality reduction and low-dimensional subspace projection methods to provide equations for the evolution of reduced states. This approach allows easy integration into the existing intrusive ROM framework to enable nonintrusive model reduction while allowing the use of Petrov-Galerkin projections. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated for Galerkin and LSPG projection-based ROMs through three numerical experiments: 1-D advection equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicate that the proposed nonintrusive ROM strategy provides accurate and stable dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Oceananigans.jl: A Julia library that achieves breakthrough resolution, memory and energy efficiency in global ocean simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models must simulate hundreds of future scenarios for hundreds of years at coarse resolutions, and a handful of high-resolution decadal simulations to resolve localized extreme events. Using Oceananigans.jl, written from scratch in Julia, we report several achievements: First, a global ocean simulation with breakthrough horizontal resolution -- 488m -- reaching 15 simulated days per day (0.04 simulated years per day; SYPD). Second, Oceananigans simulates the global ocean at 488m with breakthrough memory efficiency on just 768 Nvidia A100 GPUs, a fraction of the resources available on current and upcoming exascale supercomputers. Third, and arguably most significant for climate modeling, Oceananigans achieves breakthrough energy efficiency reaching 0.95 SYPD at 1.7 km on 576 A100s and 9.9 SYPD at 10 km on 68 A100s -- the latter representing the highest horizontal resolutions employed by current IPCC-class ocean models. Routine climate simulations with 10 km ocean components are within reach.</description>

      <title>NeuroSEM: A hybrid framework for simulating multiphysics problems by coupling PINNs and spectral elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiphysics problems that are characterized by complex interactions among fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics, are inherently challenging due to their coupled nature. While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes, particularly involving turbulence, is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages the strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into the Nektar++ solver. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions and noisy datasets, and to real particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to capture flow patterns characterized by horseshoe vortical structures. The framework's plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU-CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. This document presents some potential strategies for developing an Eulerian-Eulerian LBM solver tailored for multiphase systems. The paper first states what are the starting equations governing a multiphase flow in classical CFD. Secondly, it derives a pseudo-compressible (targeting the incompressible limit) system of equations for deriving the Eulerian-Eulerian LBM framework to simulate multiphase flows. Finally, a dispersed phase volume fraction equation is provided to balance the degree of freedom less due to the pressure gradient coupling. The effectiveness of these approaches can only be confirmed through rigorous numerical experimentation.</description>
