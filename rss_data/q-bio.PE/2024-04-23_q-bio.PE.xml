      <title>The N-Gene Model for Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel evolutionary model that incorporates Mendelian genetics, continuous strategies, and the potential for multiple genes to contribute to a single phenotypic trait. The evolution of altruistic behavior, which confers benefits to others at a cost to the individual, remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. While previous models have investigated the conditions favoring the emergence and stability of altruism, they have often employed simplifying assumptions, such as single-gene inheritance and discrete strategies. We employ a modified dictator game as the framework for evolutionary interactions and explore the stability of altruistic behavior under various conditions. Our primary result demonstrates that when considering heterozygous genes, altruism can be evolutionarily stable at cost-to-benefit ratios exceeding unity, even with initially low frequencies of altruists in the population. This finding contrasts with the case of homozygous genes, where altruism is only stable at cost-to-benefit ratios greater than 2. The generality of our approach allows for its application to a diverse range of evolutionary games and interactions, providing a powerful tool for investigating the emergence and maintenance of social behaviors and personality traits. Our results contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying altruism and underscore the importance of incorporating genetic complexity in evolutionary models. This work has implications for the study of social evolution and the genetic architecture of complex behavioral phenotypes.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent returns in nonlinear public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When individuals interact in groups, the evolution of cooperation is traditionally modeled using the framework of public goods games. Overwhelmingly, these models assume that the return of the public good depends linearly on the fraction of contributors. In contrast, it seems natural that in real life public goods interactions the return most likely depends on the size of the investor pool as well. Here, we consider a model to account for such nonlinearities in which the multiplication factor (marginal per capita return) for the public good depends on how many contribute. We find that nonlinear public goods interactions can break the curse of dominant defection in linear public goods interactions and give rise to richer dynamical outcomes in evolutionary settings. We provide an in-depth analysis of the more varied decisions by the classical rational player in nonlinear public goods interactions as well as a mechanistic, microscopic derivation of the evolutionary outcomes for the stochastic dynamics in finite populations and in the deterministic limit of infinite populations. This kind of nonlinearity provides a natural way to model public goods with diminishing returns as well as economies of scale.</description>

      <title>Temporal genomics help in deciphering neutral and adaptive patterns in the contemporary evolution of kelp populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of climate change on populations will be contingent upon their contemporary adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated the contemporary evolution of four populations of the cold-water kelp Laminaria digitata by analysing their spatial and temporal genomic variation using ddRAD-sequencing. These populations were sampled from the center to the southern margin of its north-eastern Atlantic distribution at two-time points, spanning at least two generations. Through genome scans for local adaptation at a single time point, we identified candidate loci that showed clinal variation correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) along latitudinal gradients. This finding suggests that SST may drive the adaptive response of these kelp populations, although factors such as species' demographic history should also be considered. Additionally, we performed a simulation approach to distinguish the effect of selection from genetic drift in allele frequency changes over time. This enabled the detection of loci in the southernmost population that exhibited temporal differentiation beyond what would be expected from genetic drift alone: these are candidate loci which could have evolved under selection over time. In contrast, we did not detect any outlier locus based on temporal differentiation in the population from the North Sea, which also displayed low and decreasing levels of genetic diversity. The diverse evolutionary scenarios observed among populations can be attributed to variations in the prevalence of selection relative to genetic drift across different environments. Therefore, our study highlights the potential of temporal genomics to offer valuable insights into the contemporary evolution of marine foundation species facing climate change.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fluctuations and stability in birth-death population dynamics: two-component Langevin equation in path-integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the stochastic process of creation and annihilation of particles, i.e., the $A^{n} \rightleftarrows B$ process in which $n$ particles $A$s and one particle $B$ are transformed to each other. Considering the case that the stochastic fluctuations are dependent on the numbers of $A$ and $B$, we apply the Langevin equation for the stochastic time-evolution of the numbers of $A$ and $B$. We analyze the Langevin equation in the path-integral formalism, and show that the new driving force is generated dynamically by the stochastic fluctuations. We present that the generated driving force leads to the nontrivial stable equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is regarded as the new state of order which is induced effectively by stochastic fluctuations. We also discuss that the formation of such equilibrium state requires at least two stochastic variables in the stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>DNA: Differentially private Neural Augmentation for contact tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID19 pandemic had enormous economic and societal consequences. Contact tracing is an effective way to reduce infection rates by detecting potential virus carriers early. However, this was not generally adopted in the recent pandemic, and privacy concerns are cited as the most important reason. We substantially improve the privacy guarantees of the current state of the art in decentralized contact tracing. Whereas previous work was based on statistical inference only, we augment the inference with a learned neural network and ensure that this neural augmentation satisfies differential privacy. In a simulator for COVID19, even at epsilon=1 per message, this can significantly improve the detection of potentially infected individuals and, as a result of targeted testing, reduce infection rates. This work marks an important first step in integrating deep learning into contact tracing while maintaining essential privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>A stochastic population model with hierarchic size-structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchically structured population in which the amount of resources an individual has access to is affected by individuals that are larger, and that the intake of resources by an individual only affects directly the growth rate of the individual. We formulate a deterministic model, which takes the form of a delay equation for the population birth rate. We also formulate an individual based stochastic model, and study the relationship between the two models. In particular the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model is compared to that of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. Since the quasi-stationary birth rate cannot be obtained explicitly, we derive a formula to approximate it. We show that the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model can be obtained as the large population limit of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. This relation suggests that the deterministic model is a good approximation of the stochastic model when the number of individuals is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Local intraspecific aggregation in phytoplankton model communities: spatial scales of occurrence and implications for coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of multiple phytoplankton species despite their reliance on similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming mixed populations. In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial aggregation at all scales, including at the scale of a few individuals. Local spatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals then interact mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather than competitors from different species. To evaluate how microscale spatial aggregation might explain phytoplankton diversity maintenance, an individual-based, multispecies representation of cells in a hydrodynamic environment is required. We formulate a three-dimensional and multispecies individual-based model of phytoplankton population dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale. The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of spatial moment equations, in connection with point process theory. The spatial moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations. We parameterized the model based on phytoplankters' ecological and physical characteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton. Defining a zone of potential interactions as the overlap between nutrient depletion volumes, we show that local species composition -- within the range of possible interactions -- depends on the size class of phytoplankton. In small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecific clusters. Spatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific interactions for small phytoplankton, contributing to coexistence. Large phytoplankton cell neighbourhoods appear more mixed. Although some small-scale self-organizing spatial structure remains and could influence coexistence mechanisms, other factors may need to be explored to explain diversity maintenance in large phytoplankton.</description>

      <title>On competition through growth reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population organised hierarchically with respect to size in such a way that the growth rate of each individual depends only on the presence of larger individuals. As a concrete example one might think of a forest, in which the incidence of light on a tree (and hence how fast it grows) is affected by shading of taller trees. The model is formulated as a delay equation, more specifically a scalar renewal equation, for the population birth rate. After discussing the well-posedness of the model, we analyse how many stationary birth rates the equation can have in terms of the functional parameters of the model. In particular we show that, under reasonable and rather general assumptions, only one stationary birth rate can exist besides the trivial one (associated to the state in which there are no individuals and the population birth rate is zero). We give conditions for this non-trivial stationary birth rate to exist and we analyse its stability using the principle of linearised stability for delay equations. Finally we relate the results to an alternative formulation of the model taking the form of a quasilinear partial differential equation for the population size-density.</description>

      <title>FREE: The Foundational Semantic Recognition for Modeling Environmental Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a new framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to the semantic recognition problem. The proposed FREE framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This facilitates capturing the data semantics and also allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baseline methods, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>
