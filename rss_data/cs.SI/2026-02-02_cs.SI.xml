      <title>The Benefit of Collective Intelligence in Community-Based Content Moderation is Limited by Overt Political Signalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms face increasing scrutiny over the rapid spread of misinformation. In response, many have adopted community-based content moderation systems, including Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) on X (formerly Twitter), Footnotes on TikTok, and Facebook's Community Notes initiative. However, research shows that the current design of these systems can allow political biases to influence both the development of notes and the rating processes, reducing their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that enabling users to collaborate on writing notes, rather than relying solely on individually authored notes, can enhance their overall quality. To test this idea, we conducted an online experiment in which participants jointly authored notes on political posts. Our results show that teams produce notes that are rated as more helpful than individually written notes. We also find that politically diverse teams perform better when evaluating Republican posts, while group composition does not affect perceived note quality for Democrat posts. However, the advantage of collaboration diminishes when team members are aware of one another's political affiliations. Taken together, these findings underscore the complexity of community-based content moderation and highlight the importance of understanding group dynamics and political diversity when designing more effective moderation systems.</description>

      <title>Network analysis and link prediction in competitive women's basketball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network structure and its role in prediction are examined in competitive basketball at the team and player levels. Adversarial game outcome networks from NCAA Division I women's basketball from 2021 to 2024 are used to compute the common out-neighbor score and PageRank, which are combined into a low-key leader strength that identifies competitors influential through structural similarity despite relatively low centrality. This measure is related to changes in NCAA NET rankings by grouping teams into quantiles and comparing average rank changes across seasons for both previous-to-current and current-to-next transitions. Link prediction is then studied using node2vec embeddings across three interaction settings. For NCAA regular-season game networks, cosine similarity between team embeddings is used in a logistic regression model to predict March Madness matchups. For WNBA shot-blocking networks, future directed blocking interactions are predicted via logistic regression on concatenated source-target player embeddings. For WNBA passing networks, region embeddings learned from first-quarter passes are evaluated for their ability to predict subsequent passing connections. Across NCAA and WNBA settings, embedding-based models provide statistically significant evidence that higher-order network structure contains predictive signals for future interactions, while the passing experiment shows weaker predictive performance but yields interpretable similarity patterns consistent with passing feasibility.</description>

      <title>The Iterated Local Model for tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitivity is a central, generative principle in social and other complex networks, capturing the tendency for two nodes with a common neighbor to form a direct connection. We propose a new model for highly dense, complex networks based on transitivity, called the Iterated Local Model Tournament (ILMT). In ILMT, we iteratively apply transitivity to form new tournaments by cloning nodes and their adjacencies, and either preserving or reversing the orientation of existing arcs between clones. The resulting model generates tournaments with small diameters and high connectivity as observed in real-world complex networks. We analyze subtournaments or motifs in the ILMT model and their universality properties. For many parameter choices, the model generates sequences of quasirandom tournaments. We also study the graph-theoretic properties of ILMT tournaments, including their cop number, domination number, and chromatic number. We finish with a set of open problems and variants of the ILMT model for oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.</description>

      <title>Gender Disparities in StackOverflow's Community-Based Question Answering: A Matter of Quantity versus Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community Question-Answering platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), are valuable knowledge exchange and problem-solving resources. These platforms incorporate mechanisms to assess the quality of answers and participants' expertise, ideally free from discriminatory biases. However, prior research has highlighted persistent gender biases, raising concerns about the inclusivity and fairness of these systems. Addressing such biases is crucial for fostering equitable online communities. While previous studies focus on detecting gender bias by comparing male and female user characteristics, they often overlook the interaction between genders, inherent answer quality, and the selection of ``best answers'' by question askers. In this study, we investigate whether answer quality is influenced by gender using a combination of human evaluations and automated assessments powered by Large Language Models. Our findings reveal no significant gender differences in answer quality, nor any substantial influence of gender bias on the selection of ``best answers." Instead, we find that the significant gender disparities in SO's reputation scores are primarily attributable to differences in users' activity levels, e.g., the number of questions and answers they write. Our results have important implications for the design of scoring systems in community question-answering platforms. In particular, reputation systems that heavily emphasize activity volume risk amplifying gender disparities that do not reflect actual differences in answer quality, calling for more equitable design strategies.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network for Node Regression on Random Geometric Graphs with Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Finding patterns of meaning: Reassessing Construal Clustering via Bipolar Class Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical research on \textit{construals}--social affinity groups that share similar patterns of meaning--has advanced significantly in recent years. This progress is largely driven by the development of \textit{Construal Clustering Methods} (CCMs), which group survey respondents into construal clusters based on similarities in their response patterns. We identify key limitations of existing CCMs, which affect their accuracy when applied to the typical structures of available data, and introduce Bipolar Class Analysis (BCA), a CCM designed to address these shortcomings. BCA measures similarity in response shifts between expressions of support and rejection across survey respondents, addressing conceptual and measurement challenges in existing methods. We formally define BCA and demonstrate its advantages through extensive simulation analyses, where it consistently outperforms existing CCMs in accurately identifying construals. Along the way, we develop a novel data-generation process that approximates more closely how individuals map latent opinions onto observable survey responses, as well as a new metric to evaluate the performance of CCMs. Additionally, we find that applying BCA to previously studied real-world datasets reveals substantively different construal patterns compared to those generated by existing CCMs in prior empirical analyses. Finally, we discuss limitations of BCA and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Genomic-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Spatiotemporal Avian Influenza Outbreak Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) outbreaks within wild bird populations necessitates models that account for complex, multi-scale transmission patterns driven by diverse factors. While conventional spatiotemporal epidemic models are robust for human-centric diseases, they rely on spatial homophily and diffusive transmission between geographic regions. This simplification is incomplete for AIV as it neglects valuable genomic information critical for capturing dynamics like high-frequency reassortment and lineage turnover at the case level (e.g., genetic descent across regions), which are essential for understanding AIV spread. To address these limitations, we systematically formulate the AIV forecasting problem and propose a Bi-Layer genomic-aware heterogeneous graph fusion pipeline. This pipeline integrates genetic, spatial, and ecological data to achieve highly accurate outbreak forecasting. It 1) defines a multi-layered graph structure incorporating information from diverse sources and multiple layers (case and location), 2) applies cross-relation smoothing to smooth information flow across edge types, 3) performs graph fusion that preserves critical structural patterns backed by theoretical spectral guarantees, and 4) forecasts future outbreaks using an autoregressive graph sequence model to capture transmission dynamics. To support research, we release the Avian-US dataset, which provides comprehensive genetic, spatial, and ecological data on US avian influenza outbreaks. BLUE demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines, highlighting the efficacy of integrating multi-layer information for infectious disease forecasting.

      <title>Information Loss and Disparate Effects in Network Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extensive line of work studies fairness interventions for network embeddings, but less is known about their baseline behavior. In this work, we ask: how do baseline embeddings (without fairness interventions) produce disparate effects at the representation level? We analyze the asymptotic behavior of low-dimensional embeddings on stochastic block model (SBM) graphs, which encode both homophily and group structure. We characterize exact conditions under which embeddings cause information loss, showing that the amount of information loss depends directly on the graph's density and assortativity. Notably, very different graphs can produce identical embeddings in the limit, and this non-invertibility disproportionately affects smaller and sparser communities. As a result, simple downstream tasks, such as link prediction, introduce higher error rates for these communities, helping explain disparities widely observed in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mu$-conductance measure proposed by Lov\'asz and Simonovits is a size-specific conductance score that identifies the set with smallest conductance while disregarding those sets with volume smaller than a $\mu$ fraction of the whole graph. Using $\mu$-conductance enables us to study the network structures in new ways. In this manuscript we study a modified spectral cut for $\mu$-conductance that is a natural relaxation of the integer program of $\mu$-conductance and show that the optimum of this program has a two-sided Cheeger inequality with $\mu$-conductance.</description>

      <title>Modularity maximization and community detection in complex networks through recursive and hierarchical annealing in the D-Wave Advantage quantum processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealing process as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Toward Culturally Aligned LLMs through Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.</description>

      <title>Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</description>
