      <title>Characterizations of harmonic quasiregular mappings in function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conjugate-type phenomena for complex-valued harmonic quasiregular mappings in the unit disk across three function space families: $Q(n,p,\alpha)$, $F(p,q,s)$, and the non-derivative $M(p,q,s)$. For a harmonic $K$-quasiregular mapping $f=u+iv$, we first show that if the real part $u$ belongs to $Q_h(1,p,\alpha)$ (with $\alpha&gt;-1$ and $\alpha+1&lt;p&lt;\alpha+2$), the imaginary part $v$ lies in the same space with a $K$-dependent quantitative bound. An analogous stability result is established for the harmonic $F$-scale, with sharp $K$-dependence. These results are extended to harmonic $(K, K')$-quasiregular mappings, yielding explicit estimates with an additional inhomogeneous term involving $K'$. Finally, for normalized harmonic quasiconformal mappings, %$f\in\mathcal S_H(K)$, we derive membership criteria in the harmonic $M$- and $F$-scales, and obtain corresponding conclusions for their natural derivatives, with parameter ranges governed by the order $\alpha_K$ of the family of harmonic quasiconformal mappings.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev Spaces on Quasicircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a bounded Jordan curve and $\Omega_i,\Omega_e$ its two complementary components. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty,\,s\in(0,1)$ we define $\mathcal{B}_{p,p}^s(\Omega_{i,e})$ as the set of functions $f:\Gamma\to \mathbb C$ having harmonic extension $u$ respectively in $\Omega_i$ and $\Omega_e$ such that $$ \iint_{\Omega_{i,e}} |\nabla u(z)|^p d(z,\Gamma)^{(1-s)p-1} dxdy&lt;+\infty.$$ If $\Gamma$ is further assumed to be rectifiable we define $B_{p,p}^s(\Gamma)$ as the space of functions $f\in L^p(\Gamma)$ such that $$\iint_{\Gamma\times \Gamma}\frac{|f(z)-f(\zeta)|^p}{|z-\zeta|^{1+ps}} |dz||d\zeta|&lt;+\infty.$$ When $\Gamma$ is the unit circle these three spaces coincide with the homogeneous fractional Besov-Sobolev space. For a general rectifiable curve these spaces need not coincide and our first goal is to investigate the cases of equality: while the chord-arc property is the necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the classical case of $s=1/p,\, p\ge 2$, this is no longer the case for general $s\in (0,1)$. We show however that equality holds for radial-Lipschitz curves. In the general (possibly non-rectifiable) case we study boundary values of functions in $\mathcal{B}_{p,p}^s(\Omega_{i,e})$ and give conditions for equality of these trace-spaces that we then call $\mathcal{B}^s_{p,p}(\Gamma)$. Using Plemelj-Calder\'on property we further identify $\mathcal{B}^s_{p,p}(\Gamma)$ with the space of restrictions of a weighted Sobolev space of the plane. Finally we re-interpretate some of our results as the "almost"-Dirichlet principle in the spirit of Maz'ya.</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation at a singular point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper studies the existence of valuative interpolation on the local ring of an irreducible analytic subvariety at singular points. We firstly develop the concepts and methods of Zhou weights and Tian functions near singular points of irreducible analytic subvarieties. By applying these tools, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and weakly holomorphic functions at a singular point.
  As applications, we characterize the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of the ring of convergent power series in real variables. We also present separated necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of polynomial rings with complex coefficients and real coefficients. Furthermore, we show that the conditions become both necessary and sufficient under certain conditions on the zero set of the given polynomials.</description>

      <title>Separation properties of a hybrid point process with determinantal radii and uniform arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently characterized the separated determinantal point processes $\Lambda_\phi$ associated with Fock spaces $\mathcal F_\phi$ in the plane with doubling weight $\phi$. We also showed that, as expected, a more restrictive condition is required to characterize the separated Poisson processes with the same first intensities as $\Lambda_\phi$. To gain further insight into this different behavior, we center our attention to radial weights $\phi(z)$ and introduce a hybrid process $\Lambda_\phi^M=\{r_k e^{i\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$, where the moduli $r_k$ are taken from $\Lambda_\phi$, while the arguments $\theta_k$ are chosen independently and uniformly in $[0,2\pi)$. Our main result is that $\Lambda_\phi^M$ is almost surely separated if and only if its first intensity satisfies the same condition as in the Poisson case.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections in the local Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the orthogonal projection onto the subspace of analytic polynomials of degree at most $n$ in the local Dirichlet space $D_\mu$ , where the positive measure $\mu$ consists of a finite number of Dirac measures located at points on the unit circle $\mathbb T$. This result has two key aspects: first, while it is known that polynomials are dense in $D_\mu$ , this approach offers a concrete linear approximation scheme within the space. Second, due to the orthogonality of the polynomials involved, the scheme is qualitative, as the distance of an arbitrary function $f\in D_\mu$ to the projected subspace is explicitly determined.</description>

      <title>Absolutely summing Hankel operators on Fock spaces and the Berger-Coburn phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for $1 \leq p, r &lt; \infty$ we characterize those symbols $f$ so that the induced Hankel operators $H_f$ are $r$-summing from Fock spaces $F^p_\alpha$ to $L^p_\alpha$. The main result shows that the $r$-summing norm of $H_f$ is equivalent to the $\mathrm{IDA}^{\kappa, p}$-norm of $f$, where $\kappa$ is a positive number determined by $p$ and $r$, and the $\mathrm{IDA}$ space is as in [13]. As some application, we discuss the Berger-Coburn phenomenon for $r$-summing Hankel operators on Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>A parametric Keldysh decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contour integral algorithms seek to compute a small number of eigenvalues located within a bounded region of the complex plane. These methods can be applied to both linear and nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problems. In the latter case, the foundation of these methods comes from the Keldysh decomposition, which breaks the nonlinear matrix-valued function into two parts: a rational function whose poles match the desired eigenvalues, and a remainder term that is analytic within the target region. Under contour integration this analytic part vanishes (via Cauchy's theorem), leaving only the component containing the desired eigenvalues. We propose an extension of the Keldysh decomposition for matrix-valued functions that depend analytically on an additional parameter. We establish key properties of this parametric Keldysh decomposition, and introduce an algorithm for solving parametric nonlinear eigenvalue problems that is based upon it.</description>

      <title>Broadband quasistatic passive cloaking: bounds and limitations in the near-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.</description>

      <title>Tangential boundary behavior in Hilbert spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarason's Hilbert space version of Carath\'eodory-Julia Theorem connects the non-tangential boundary behavior of functions in de Branges-Rovnyak space $H(b)$ with the existence of angular derivatives in the sense of Carath\'eodory for $b$, an analytic self-mapping of the unit disk. In this article, we continue the study of higher order extensions of this result that deal with derivatives of functions in $H(b)$, and we consider notions of approach regions more general than the non-tangential ones. Our main result generalizes the recent work of Duan-Li-Mashreghi on boundary behavior in model spaces to $H(b)$-spaces and to higher order derivatives, and we give a new self-contained proof of that result. It also generalizes earlier radial results of Fricain-Mashreghi. In relation to existence of angular derivatives, we show that in the classical Carath\'eodory-Julia Theorem one cannot replace the non-tangential approach region by any essentially larger region.</description>

Abstract: We study the embedding of integrable Teichm\"uller spaces $T_p$ into analytic Besov spaces via pre-Schwarzian derivatives. In contrast to the Bers embedding by Schwarzian derivatives, a significant difference arises between the cases $p&gt;1$ and $p=1$. In this paper we focus on the case $p=1$ and extend previous results obtained for $p&gt;1$. This provides a unified framework for the complex-analytic theory of integrable Teichm\"uller spaces $T_p$ for all $p \geq 1$.</description>

Abstract: We study random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii in the Nevanlinna and Smirnov classes. As it turns out these are characterized by the Blaschke condition. This follows from a more general result. Indeed, we show that this characterization is true in so-called big Hardy-Orlicz spaces. It is noteworthy to mention that conditions for deterministic interpolation in these spaces are given by harmonic majorants, the existence of which is difficult to check in general.</description>

Abstract: On two subsurfaces of a Riemann surface divided by a $p$-Weil-Petersson curve $\gamma$, we consider the spaces of harmonic functions whose $p$-Dirichlet integrals are finite in the complementary domains of $\gamma$. By requiring the coincidence of boundary values on $\gamma$, we establish a correspondence between the harmonic functions in these Banach spaces. We analyze the operator arising from this correspondence via the composition operator acting on the Banach space of $p$-Besov functions on the unit circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey paper we study parametric versions of writing a matrix in $SL_n (\mathbb{C})$ as a product of lower and upper unitriangular matrices in interchanging order as well as generalizations to other classical groups. We give an account of algebraic, continuous and holomorphic factorization results, from the standpoint of Several Complex Variables. Out of the wealth of algebraic results, we only concentrate on those which are related to holomorphic factorization and often formulate them in a specific form, e.g. for the field of complex numbers in place of more general fields or principal ideal domains. The number of unitriangular matrices needed is a difficult problem and is solved in very specific cases only. We give a new lower bound for factorizing matrices in $SL_2 (\mathbb{C})$ continuously parametrized by normal topological spaces of dimension bigger than one.</description>

      <title>Complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions and the Brennan conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09330v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions in the unit disk. We show that all integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals for complex exponents on the universal Teichm\"uller space, the closure of the universal Teichm\"uller curve, and the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space are continuous. We also show that the complex exponential integral means spectrum of any univalent function admitting a quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane is strictly less than the universal integral means spectrum. These extend some related results in our recent work \cite{Jin}. Here we employ a different and more direct approach to prove the continuity of IMS functional on the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space. Additionally, we completely determine the integral means spectrums of all univalent rational functions in the unit disk. As a consequence, we show that the Brennan conjecture is true for this class of univalent functions. Finally, we present some remarks and raise some problems and conjectures regarding IMS functionals on Teichm\"uller spaces, univalent rational functions, and a multiplier operator whose norm is closely related to the Brennan conjecture.</description>

      <title>Diederich-Forn\ae ss index and global regularity of the complex Green operator: domains with comparable Levi eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{C}^{n}$, with $n \geq 3$, be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain satisfying the symmetric eigenvalue comparability condition $D(q_0)$ for some $1\le q_0\le n-2$. We show that if the Diederich-Fornaess-index of $\Omega$ is one, then the complex Green operator $G_q$, associated with $\Omega$, is globally regular for $q$ in the range $\min\{q_0,\, n - 1 - q_0\} \leq q \leq \max\{q_0,\, n - 1 - q_0\}$.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the B\'ezout Equation for Banach Algebra-Valued $H^\infty$ Functions on the Polydisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In connection with the still unsolved multidimensional corona problem for algebras of bounded holomorphic functions on convex domains, we study the solvability of the B\'ezout equation for the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the polydisk with values in a complex Banach algebra. Assuming local solvability of the B\'ezout equation on a special open cover of the maximal ideal space of the algebra, we combine a dimension-induction scheme with a careful analysis of the topological structure of this space to glue local solutions into a global one. As a corollary, we obtain the solvability of the B\'ezout equation for a broader class of subalgebras containing the slice algebra of bounded holomorphic functions, the case of the latter having been previously proved by the first author</description>

      <title>Transcendental Okounkov bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the volume of transcendental big $(1,1)$-classes on compact K\"ahler manifolds can be realized by convex bodies, thus answering questions of Lazarsfeld-Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Deng. In our approach we use an approximation process by partial Okounkov bodies together with properties of the restricted volume, and we study the extension of K\"ahler currents, as well as the bimeromorphic behavior of currents with analytic singularities. We also establish a connection between transcendental Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations.</description>

      <title>Inner approximations of doubling weights with applications to Beurling-Malliavin theory in Toeplitz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a strictly increasing smooth function, such that $f'$ is comparable to a weight $\alpha'$ which is locally doubling and satisfies a non-triviality condition to be explained in the paper. We construct a meromorphic inner function $J$, such that $f-\arg(J)$ is bounded and $\arg(J)'$ is comparable to $\alpha'$ up to polynomial loss. We give two applications of this result. The first is a sufficient density condition for a set $\Lambda$ to be a zero set for a Toeplitz kernel with real analytic and unimodular symbol. Our second application is to describe a class of admissible Beurling-Malliavin majorants in model spaces. The generality considered here lets us treat most cases of model spaces generated by one-component inner functions.</description>
