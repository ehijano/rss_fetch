      <title>A Multi-Modal Spatial Risk Framework for EV Charging Infrastructure Using Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover (LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting R: Statistical Envelope Analysis for Lightweight RF Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation classification plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems, enabling applications such as cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and electronic warfare. Conventional techniques often involve deep learning or complex feature extraction, which, while effective, require substantial computational resources and memory. An early approach by Chan and Gadbois in 1985 introduced a theoretical method for modulation classification using a mathematically derived parameter called R. The authors proved that the R value - the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean of the signal envelope - can be a distinguishing feature for classification. In this work, we revisit the R value and show that classification accuracy can be improved further through statistical methods. We extend R-value analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness even after signals are transformed using the Hilbert transform followed by the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Our analysis includes testing on 300000 signals across AM, DSB, and SSB classes, with each class having 100000 random variations. On average, we achieve 98.60, 97.30, and 97.90 percent classification accuracy for AM, DSB, and SSB signals after applying the Hilbert transform. Similar or better accuracies are observed after applying the STFT, reaching 98.80, 99.10, and 99.00 percent, respectively, for AM, DSB, and SSB types.</description>

      <title>Posterior Cram\'er-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance. While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the position and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.</description>

      <title>Near-Field SWIPT Using XL-MIMO: Power Allocation and Subarray Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) capability of a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, in the context of power consumption (PC) efficiency. The network users are divided into two functional categories: information decoding (ID) users and energy harvesting (EH) users. Non-stationary near-field channels are considered whilst the users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs). We formulate a two-tier joint optimization problem to minimize the PC, taking into account the power allocation (PA) for ID and EH users, along with the activation of constituent XL-MIMO subarrays. This complicated mixed-integer problem is transformed into more tractable formulations and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving them. The numerical results demonstrate that the overall PC of the XL-MIMO system for the proposed method is reduced by more than 60% in comparison to the benchmark scheme of equal PA with full subarray activation (SA) and 30% against the case of optimized PA with full SA, while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on both the downlink rate of the ID users and harvested energy at the EH users.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Energy Harvesting Using XL-MIMO Over Non-Stationary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE) in a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, which supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary channel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched on or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize the HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization framework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that the HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to that of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain over the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power allocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the computational time.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Ordered Reliability Direct Error Pattern Testing (ORDEPT) Decoding with Likelihood Thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reduced complexity approach to pattern-based soft decoding of block codes. We start from the ORDEPT decoding algorithm which tests a list of partial error patterns organized in the order of their likelihood and attempts to complete the patterns creating candidate codewords. We then propose an early termination criterion. Once a candidate codeword is found, its log-likelihood difference to the received sequence is compared to a preset threshold and the decoding decision is instantly made in case the likelihood deviation is below the threshold. We demonstrate that while keeping the same block error rate (BLER) performance, the proposed algorithm's latency and complexity is multiple times smaller than that of the state-of-the art competitors including the Chase II, ORBGRAND, GCD, and the very recent ORDEPT with Soft-Output GRAND termination which necessitates several multiplications in each query processing.</description>

      <title>Joint Quantization and Pruning Neural Networks Approach: A Case Study on FSO Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards fast, hardware-efficient, and low-complexity receivers, we propose a compression-aware learning approach and examine it on free-space optical (FSO) receivers for turbulence mitigation. The learning approach jointly quantize, prune, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we propose to have the CNN weights of power of two values so we replace the multiplication operations bit-shifting operations in every layer that has significant lower computational cost. The compression idea in the proposed approach is that the loss function is updated and both the quantization levels and the pruning limits are optimized in every epoch of training. The compressed CNN is examined for two levels of compression (1-bit and 2-bits) over different FSO systems. The numerical results show that the compression approach provides negligible decrease in performance in case of 1-bit quantization and the same performance in case of 2-bits quantization, compared to the full-precision CNNs. In general, the proposed IM/DD FSO receivers show better bit-error rate (BER) performance (without the need for channel state information (CSI)) compared to the maximum likelihood (ML) receivers that utilize imperfect CSI when the DL model is compressed whether with 1-bit or 2-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Aware Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for OFDM-MBS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the problem of cooperative sensing design for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple base stations (MBS) system. We consider a practical scenario where the base stations (BSs) exploit certain subcarriers to realize a sensing function. Since the high sidelobe level (SLL) of OFDM waveforms degrades radar detection for weak targets, and the cross-correlation generated by other BSs further exacerbates detection performance, we devise a joint design scheme for OFDM sequence and receive filter by minimizing the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) while satisfying mainlobe level, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum allocation constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superiority of SSL reduction in the MBS system over the matched filtering method.</description>

      <title>Time and covariance smoothing for restoration of bivariate signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications and physical phenomena, bivariate signals are polarized, i.e. they trace an elliptical trajectory over time when viewed in the 2D planes of their two components. The smooth evolution of this elliptical trajectory, called polarization ellipse, is highly informative to solve ill-posed inverse problems involving bivariate signals where the signal is collected through indirect, noisy or incomplete measurements. This work proposes a novel formulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals with polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the compact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance matrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a well-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative algorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex subproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments.</description>

      <title>Superimposed DMRS for Spectrally Efficient 6G Uplink Multi-User OFDM: Classical vs AI/ML Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) systems utilize orthogonal demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to enable channel estimation at the receiver. These orthogonal DMRS-also referred to as pilots-are effective in avoiding pilot contamination and interference from both the user's own data and that of others. However, this approach incurs a significant overhead, as a substantial portion of the time-frequency resources must be reserved for pilot transmission. Moreover, the overhead increases with the number of users and transmission layers.
  To address these limitations in the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G) systems and to support data transmission across the entire time-frequency grid, the superposition of data and DMRS symbols has been explored as an alternative DMRS transmission strategy. In this study, we propose an enhanced version of DeepRx, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based receiver, capable of estimating the channel from received superimposed (SI) DMRS symbols and reliably detecting the transmitted data. We also design a conventional receiver for comparison, which estimates the channel from SI DMRS using classical signal processing techniques. Extensive evaluations in both uplink single-user and multi-user scenarios demonstrate that DeepRx consistently outperforms the conventional receivers in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for fully analog or hybrid analog-digital OFDM system, offering a promising solution for next-generation high-speed, wideband, and energy-efficient wireless communication platforms.</description>

      <title>OLALa: Online Learned Adaptive Lattice Codes for Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates. This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties. However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices (OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for UAV-Based Free-Space Quantum Links: Beam Shaping and Adaptive Field-of-View Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive analytical framework for modeling and performance evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-to-ground quantum communication links, incorporating key physical impairments such as beam divergence, pointing errors at both transmitter and receiver, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence-induced fading, narrow field-of-view (FoV) filtering, and background photon noise. To overcome the limitations of conventional wide-beam assumptions, we introduce a grid-based approximation for photon capture probability that remains accurate under tightly focused beams. Analytical expressions are derived for the quantum key generation rate and quantum bit error rate (QBER), enabling fast and reliable system-level evaluation. Our results reveal that secure quantum key distribution (QKD) over UAV-based free-space optical (FSO) links requires beam waists below 10 cm and sub-milliradian tracking precision to achieve Mbps-level key rates and QBER below $10^{-3}$. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of receiver FoV in balancing background noise rejection and misalignment tolerance, and propose adaptive FoV tuning strategies under varying illumination and alignment conditions. The proposed framework provides a tractable and accurate tool for the design, optimization, and deployment of next-generation airborne quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Active RIS Enabled NLoS LEO Satellite Communications: A Three-timescale Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study an active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) assisted Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, where the active RIS is deployed to create visual line-of-sight links for reliable communication. To address the challenges of high energy consumption caused by frequent beamforming updates in active RIS, we propose a three-timescale optimization framework that jointly designs the transmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, and RIS direction vectors based on their characteristics. The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while reducing energy consumption by controlling the RIS beamforming switching frequency. Then, a two-layer solution framework is developed, incorporating fractional programming (FP), alternating optimization (AO), successive approximation (SCA), and penalty-based methods, to obtain the optimized solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve system performance and reduce the energy consumption of the active RIS.</description>

      <title>Revisiting CHAMPAGNE: Sparse Bayesian Learning as Reweighted Sparse Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the CHAMPAGNE algorithm within the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) framework and establishes its connection to reweighted sparse coding. We demonstrate that the SBL objective can be reformulated as a reweighted $\ell_{21}$-minimization problem, providing a more straightforward interpretation of the sparsity mechanism and enabling the design of an efficient iterative algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions, particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Communicating Smartly in Molecular Communication Environments: Neural Networks in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>

      <title>Differential Transformer-driven 6G Physical Layer for Collaborative Perception Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless networks promises to revolutionize vehicular communications by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity data exchange. In this context, collaborative perception techniques, where multiple vehicles or infrastructure nodes cooperate to jointly receive and decode transmitted signals, aim to enhance reliability and spectral efficiency for Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end wireless neural receiver based on a Differential Transformer architecture, tailored for 6G V2X communication with a specific focus on enabling collaborative perception among connected autonomous vehicles. Our model integrates key components of the 6G physical layer, designed to boost performance in dynamic and challenging autonomous driving environments. We validate the proposed system across a range of scenarios, including 3GPP-defined Urban Macro (UMa) channel. To assess the model's real-world applicability, we evaluate its robustness within a V2X framework. In a collaborative perception scenario, our system processes heterogeneous LiDAR and camera data from four connected vehicles in dynamic cooperative vehicular networks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average precision of 0.84, highlighting the potential of our proposed approach to enable robust, intelligent, and adaptive wireless cooperation for next-generation connected autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>MC for Agriculture: A Framework for Nature-inspired Sustainable Pest Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In agriculture, molecular communication (MC) is envisioned as a framework to address critical challenges such as smart pest control. While conventional approaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high risks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to innovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this paper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how the MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular, we consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres deployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the microspheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and antagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant protection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA release kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of MeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D) advection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are predominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite difference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA distribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical microsphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage effectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental coverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical development of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage and, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.</description>

      <title>Notes on Degeneracy and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degeneracy is the ability of structurally different elements to perform the same function or yield the same output under certain constraints. In contrast to redundancy, which implies identical backups, degeneracy allows diverse components to step in and perform the same or similar role. Mathematically, it is about mapping multiple distinct elements into the same function. In a degenerate system, failure in one part can be compensated by others not structurally linked. System functions are distributed within the system itself or the entire network. This renders faster and more adaptive recovery. In this work, we define and formulate several novel metrics for resource fungibility to address robustness in networks (static/mobile/dynamic).</description>

      <title>VoxelOpt: Voxel-Adaptive Message Passing for Discrete Optimization in Deformable Abdominal CT Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations, we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation for Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Causal discovery in deterministic discrete LTI-DAE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations. However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables (PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations ($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix. Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation for Hybrid Event-RGB Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs. This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information. Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an unsourced random access (URA) system enhanced with a feedback mechanism that serves both communication and sensing tasks. While traditional URA systems do not incorporate feedback, we propose a novel feedback signal design that announces the decoding status of users and simultaneously enables target sensing. To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified projected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of communication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed feedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and sensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks.</description>

      <title>Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO OFDM with Phase Noise-Aware Channel Estimation: Separate and Shared Local Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks enhance coverage and spectral efficiency (SE) by distributing antennas across access points (APs) with phase coherence between APs. However, the use of cost-efficient local oscillators (LOs) introduces phase noise (PN) that compromises phase coherence, even with centralized processing. Sharing an LO across APs can reduce costs in specific configurations but cause correlated PN between APs, leading to correlated interference that affects centralized combining. This can be improved by exploiting the PN correlation in channel estimation. This paper presents an uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal model for PN-impaired cell-free mMIMO, addressing gaps in single-carrier signal models. We evaluate mismatches from applying single-carrier methods to OFDM systems, showing how they underestimate the impact of PN and produce over-optimistic achievable SE predictions. Based on our OFDM signal model, we propose two PN-aware channel and common phase error estimators: a distributed estimator for uncorrelated PN with separate LOs and a centralized estimator with shared LOs. We introduce a deep learning-based channel estimator to enhance the performance and reduce the number of iterations of the centralized estimator. The simulation results show that the distributed estimator outperforms mismatched estimators with separate LOs, whereas the centralized estimator enhances distributed estimators with shared LOs.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>

Abstract: Mental stress poses a significant public health concern due to its detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being, necessitating the development of continuous stress monitoring tools for wearable devices. Blood volume pulse (BVP) sensors, readily available in many smartwatches, offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for stress monitoring. This study proposes a deep learning approach, a Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network (TEANet), for stress detection using BVP signals. The proposed TEANet model was trained and validated utilizing a self-collected RUET SPML dataset, comprising 19 healthy subjects, and the publicly available wearable stress and affect detection (WESAD) dataset, comprising 15 healthy subjects. It achieves the highest accuracy of 92.51% and 96.94%, F1 scores of 95.03% and 95.95%, and kappa of 0.7915 and 0.9350 for RUET SPML, and WESAD datasets respectively. The proposed TEANet effectively detects mental stress through BVP signals with high accuracy, making it a promising tool for continuous stress monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively addresses class imbalances and demonstrates high accuracy, underscoring its potential for reliable real-time stress monitoring using wearable devices.</description>

Abstract: Wearable biosensors have revolutionized human performance monitoring by enabling real-time assessment of physiological and biomechanical parameters. However, existing solutions lack the ability to simultaneously capture breath-force coordination and muscle activation symmetry in a seamless and non-invasive manner, limiting their applicability in strength training and rehabilitation. This work presents a wearable smart sportswear system that integrates screen-printed graphene-based strain sensors with compact electronics for wireless data transfer and a deep learning framework for real-time classification of exercise execution quality. By leveraging 1D ResNet-18 for feature extraction, the system achieves 92.1% classification accuracy across six exercise conditions, distinguishing between breathing irregularities and asymmetric muscle exertion. Additionally, t-SNE analysis and Grad-CAM-based explainability visualization confirm that the network accurately captures biomechanically relevant features, ensuring robust interpretability. The proposed system establishes a foundation for next-generation AI-powered sportswear, with applications in fitness optimization, injury prevention, and adaptive rehabilitation training.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections.
  In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Spread Carrier Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility &amp; delay spread environments.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Wireless Channel Statistics with Ray Tracing and Uncalibrated Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for predicting wireless channel statistics based on digital twin (DT) and ray tracing. The DT is derived from satellite images and is uncalibrated, as it does not assume precise information on the electromagnetic properties of the materials in the environment. The uncalibrated DT is utilized to derive a geometric prior that informs a Gaussian process (GP) and thereby predict channel statistics using only a few measurements. The framework also quantifies uncertainty, offering statistical guarantees for rate selection in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework using measurement data.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Detection of Permutational Index Modulation for Noncoherent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.</description>
