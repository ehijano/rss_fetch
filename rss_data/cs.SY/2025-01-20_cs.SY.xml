      <title>Crossover-BPSO Driven Multi-Agent Technology for Managing Local Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new hybrid algorithm, crossover binary particle swarm optimization (crBPSO), for allocating resources in local energy systems via multi-agent (MA) technology. Initially, a hierarchical MA-based architecture in a grid-connected local energy setup is presented. In this architecture, task specific agents operate in a master-slave manner. Where, the master runs a well-formulated optimization routine aiming at minimizing costs of energy procurement, battery degradation, and load scheduling delay. The slaves update the master on their current status and receive optimal action plans accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms selected existing ones by 21\% in terms average energy system costs while satisfying customers' energy demand and maintaining the required quality of service.</description>

      <title>Greening the Grid: Electricity Market Clearing with Consumer-Based Carbon Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance decarbonization efforts in electric power systems, we propose a novel electricity market clearing model that internalizes the allocation of emissions from generations to loads and allows for consideration of consumer-side carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can not only bid for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. These carbon costs provide consumers, ranging from carbon-agnostic to carbon-sensitive, with a tool to actively manage their roles in carbon emission mitigation. By incorporating carbon allocation and consumer-side carbon costs, the market clearing is influenced not solely by production and demand dynamics but also by the allocation of carbon emission responsibilities. To demonstrate the effect of our proposed model, we conduct a case study comparing market clearing outcomes across various percentages of carbon-sensitive consumers with differing carbon costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Assessment of Power System Resilience Using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion Method with Enhanced Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events motivates the assessment of power system resilience. The random nature of these events and the resulting failures mandates probabilistic resilience assessment, but state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation) are computationally inefficient. This paper leverages the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method to efficiently quantify uncertainty in power system resilience. To address repeatability issues arising from PCE computation with different sample sets, we propose the integration of the Maximin-LHS experiment design method with the PCE method. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system illustrate the improved repeatability and convergence of the proposed method. The enhanced PCE method is then used to assess the resilience of the system and propose adaptation measures to improve it.</description>

      <title>Learning port maneuvers from data for automatic guidance of Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At shipping ports, some repetitive maneuvering tasks such as entering/leaving port, transporting goods inside it or just making surveillance activities, can be efficiently and quickly carried out by a domestic pilot according to his experience. This know-how can be seized by Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) in order to autonomously replicate the same tasks. However, the inherent nonlinearity of ship trajectories and environmental perturbations as wind or marine currents make it difficult to learn a model and its respective control. We therefore present a data-driven learning and control methodology for USV, which is based on Gaussian Mixture Model, Gaussian Mixture Regression and the Sontag's universal formula. Our approach is capable to learn the nonlinear dynamics as well as guarantee the convergence toward the target with a robust controller. Real data have been collected through experiments with a vessel at the port of Ceuta. The complex trajectories followed by an expert have been learned including the robust controller. The effect of the controller over noise/perturbations are presented, a measure of error is used to compare estimates and real data trajectories, and finally, an analysis of computational complexity is performed.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Time Sequential Traversal by a Team of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in an Unknown Environment with Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transporting multiple packages from an initial location to a destination location in a windy urban environment using a team of SUAVs. Each SUAV carries one package. We assume that the wind field is unknown, but wind speed can be measured by SUAVs during flight. The SUAVs fly sequentially one after the other, measure wind speeds along their trajectories, and report the measurements to a central computer. The overall objective is to minimize the total travel time of all SUAVs, which is in turn related to the number of SUAV traversals through the environment. For a discretized environment modeled by a graph, we describe a method to estimate wind speeds and the time of traversal for each SUAV path. Each SUAV traverses a minimum-time path planned based on the current wind field estimate. We study cases of static and time-varying wind fields with and without measurement noise. For each case, we demonstrate via numerical simulation that the proposed method finds the optimal path after a minimal number of traversals.</description>

      <title>AI Explainability for Power Electronics: From a Lipschitz Continuity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifecycle management of power converters continues to thrive with emerging artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, yet AI mathematical explainability remains unexplored in power electronics (PE) community. The lack of theoretical rigor challenges adoption in mission-critical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a generic framework to evaluate mathematical explainability, highlighting inference stability and training convergence from a Lipschitz continuity perspective. Inference stability governs consistent outputs under input perturbations, essential for robust real-time control and fault diagnosis. Training convergence guarantees stable learning dynamics, facilitating accurate modeling in PE contexts. Additionally, a Lipschitz-aware learning rate selection strategy is introduced to accelerate convergence while mitigating overshoots and oscillations. The feasibility of the proposed Lipschitz-oriented framework is demonstrated by validating the mathematical explainability of a state-of-the-art physics-in-architecture neural network, and substantiated through empirical case studies on dual-active-bridge converters. This letter serves as a clarion call for the PE community to embrace mathematical explainability, heralding a transformative era of trustworthy and explainable AI solutions that potentially redefine the future of power electronics.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Parallel Collaborative Simulation Framework Integrating Device Physics with Circuit Dynamics for PDAE-Modeled Power Electronic Equipment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing high-performance power electronic equipment, such as power converters, requires multiscale simulations that incorporate the physics of power semiconductor devices and the dynamics of other circuit components, especially in conducting Design of Experiments (DoEs), defining the safe operating area of devices, and analyzing failures related to semiconductor devices. However, current methodologies either overlook the intricacies of device physics or do not achieve satisfactory computational speeds. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a Hybrid-Parallel Collaborative (HPC) framework specifically designed to analyze the Partial Differential Algebraic Equation (PDAE) modeled power electronic equipment, integrating the device physics and circuit dynamics. The HPC framework employs a dynamic iteration to tackle the challenges inherent in solving the coupled nonlinear PDAE system, and utilizes a hybrid-parallel computing strategy to reduce computing time. Physics-based system partitioning along with hybrid-process-thread parallelization on shared and distributed memory are employed, facilitating the simulation of hundreds of partial differential equations (PDEs)-modeled devices simultaneously without compromising speed. Experiments based on the hybrid line commutated converter and reverse-blocking integrated gate-commutated thyristors are conducted under 3 typical real-world scenarios: semiconductor device optimization for the converter; converter design optimization; and device failure analysis. The HPC framework delivers simulation speed up to 60 times faster than the leading commercial software, while maintaining carrier-level accuracy in the experiments. This shows great potential for comprehensive analysis and collaborative optimization of devices and electronic power equipment, particularly in extreme conditions and failure scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and Quantification of SOTIF Requirements for Perception Systems of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount before they can be introduced to the market.
  More specifically, securing the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) poses a notable challenge; while ISO 21448 outlines numerous activities to refine the performance of AVs, it offers minimal quantitative guidance. This paper endeavors to decompose the acceptance criterion into quantitative perception requirements, aiming to furnish developers with requirements that are not only understandable but also actionable. This paper introduces a risk decomposition methodology to derive SOTIF requirements for perception. More explicitly, for subsystemlevel safety requirements, we define a collision severity model to establish requirements for state uncertainty and present a Bayesian model to discern requirements for existence uncertainty.
  For component-level safety requirements, we proposed a decomposition method based on the Shapley value. Our findings indicate that these methods can effectively decompose the system-level safety requirements into quantitative perception requirements, potentially facilitating the safety verification of various AV components.</description>

      <title>Pricing Mechanisms versus Non-Pricing Mechanisms for Demand Side Management in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare pricing and non-pricing mechanisms for implementing demand-side management (DSM) mechanisms in a neighborhood in Helsinki, Finland. We compare load steering based on peak load-reduction using the profile steering method, and load steering based on market price signals, in terms of peak loads, losses, and device profiles. We found that there are significant differences between the two methods; the peak-load reduction control strategies contribute to reducing peak power and improving power flow stability, while strategies primarily based on prices result in higher peaks and increased grid losses. Our results highlight the need to potentially move away from market-price-based DSM to DSM incentivization and control strategies that are based on peak load reductions and other system requirements.</description>

      <title>Actively Coupled Sensor Configuration and Planning in Unknown Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of path-planning for an autonomous mobile vehicle, called the ego vehicle, in an unknown andtime-varying environment. The objective is for the ego vehicle to minimize exposure to a spatiotemporally-varying unknown scalar field called the threat field. Noisy measurements of the threat field are provided by a network of mobile sensors. Weaddress the problem of optimally configuring (placing) these sensors in the environment. To this end, we propose sensor reconfiguration by maximizing a reward function composed of three different elements. First, the reward includes an informa tion measure that we call context-relevant mutual information (CRMI). Unlike typical sensor placement techniques that maxi mize mutual information of the measurements and environment state, CRMI directly quantifies uncertainty reduction in the ego path cost while it moves in the environment. Therefore, the CRMI introduces active coupling between the ego vehicle and the sensor network. Second, the reward includes a penalty on the distances traveled by the sensors. Third, the reward includes a measure of proximity of the sensors to the ego vehicle. Although we do not consider communication issues in this paper, such proximity is of relevance for future work that addresses communications between the sensors and the ego vehicle. We illustrate and analyze the proposed technique via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</description>

      <title>From Explainability to Interpretability: Interpretable Policies in Reinforcement Learning Via Model Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in complex domains, however, the inherent black box nature of deep neural network policies raises significant challenges in understanding and trusting the decision-making processes. While existing explainable RL methods provide local insights, they fail to deliver a global understanding of the model, particularly in high-stakes applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach that bridges the gap between explainability and interpretability by leveraging Shapley values to transform complex deep RL policies into transparent representations. The proposed approach offers two key contributions: a novel approach employing Shapley values to policy interpretation beyond local explanations and a general framework applicable to off-policy and on-policy algorithms. We evaluate our approach with three existing deep RL algorithms and validate its performance in two classic control environments. The results demonstrate that our approach not only preserves the original models' performance but also generates more stable interpretable policies.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Aware RIoT System: Analysis, Modeling and Prediction in the SUPERIOT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption characteristics of a Silicon (Si)-based Reconfigurable IoT (RIoT) node developed in the initial phase of the SUPERIOT project, focusing on key operating states, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, Narrow-Band Visible Light Communication (NBVLC), sensing, and E-ink display. Extensive measurements were conducted to establish a detailed energy profile, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations and future node iterations. To minimize the energy consumption, multiple optimizations were implemented at both the software and hardware levels, achieving a reduction of over 60% in total energy usage through software modifications alone. Further improvements were realized by optimizing the E-ink display driving waveform and implementing a very low-power mode for non-communication activities. Based on the measured data, three measurement-based energy consumption models were developed to characterize the energy behavior of the node under: (i) normal, unoptimized operation, (ii) low-power, software-optimized operation, and (iii) very low-power, hardware-optimized operation. These models, validated with new measurement data, achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming their reliability for predicting energy consumption in diverse configurations.</description>

      <title>ODMA-Based Cell-Free Unsourced Random Access with Successive Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the unsourced random access problem with multiple receivers and propose a cell-free type solution for that. In our proposed scheme, the active users transmit their signals to the access points (APs) distributed in a geographical area and connected to a central processing unit (CPU). The transmitted signals are composed of a pilot and polar codeword, where the polar codeword bits occupy a small fraction of the data part of the transmission frame. The receiver operations of pilot detection and channel and symbol estimation take place at the APs, while the actual message bits are detected at the CPU by combining the symbol estimates from the APs forwarded over the fronthaul. The effect of the successfully decoded messages is then subtracted at the APs. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed scheme can support up to 1400 users with a high energy efficiency, and the distributed structure decreases the error probability by more than two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Deployment of an Aerial Multi-agent System for Automated Task Execution in Large-scale Underground Mining Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for deploying an aerial multi-agent system in large-scale subterranean environments with minimal infrastructure for supporting multi-agent operations. The multi-agent objective is to optimally and reactively allocate and execute inspection tasks in a mine, which are entered by a mine operator on-the-fly. The assignment of currently available tasks to the team of agents is accomplished through an auction-based system, where the agents bid for available tasks, which are used by a central auctioneer to optimally assigns tasks to agents. A mobile Wi-Fi mesh supports inter-agent communication and bi-directional communication between the agents and the task allocator, while the task execution is performed completely infrastructure-free. Given a task to be accomplished, a reliable and modular agent behavior is synthesized by generating behavior trees from a pool of agent capabilities, using a back-chaining approach. The auction system in the proposed framework is reactive and supports addition of new operator-specified tasks on-the-go, at any point through a user-friendly operator interface. The framework has been validated in a real underground mining environment using three aerial agents, with several inspection locations spread in an environment of almost 200 meters. The proposed framework can be utilized for missions involving rapid inspection, gas detection, distributed sensing and mapping etc. in a subterranean environment. The proposed framework and its field deployment contributes towards furthering reliable automation in large-scale subterranean environments to offload both routine and dangerous tasks from human operators to autonomous aerial robots.</description>

      <title>From Semi-Infinite Constraints to Structured Robust Policies: Optimal Gain Selection for Financial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust optimal gain selection problem for financial trading systems, formulated within a \emph{double linear policy} framework, which allocates capital across long and short positions. The key objective is to guarantee \emph{robust positive expected} (RPE) profits uniformly across a range of uncertain market conditions while ensuring risk control. This problem leads to a robust optimization formulation with \emph{semi-infinite} constraints, where the uncertainty is modeled by a bounded set of possible return parameters. We address this by transforming semi-infinite constraints into structured policies -- the \emph{balanced} policy and the \emph{complementary} policy -- which enable explicit characterization of the optimal solution. Additionally, we propose a novel graphical approach to efficiently solve the robust gain selection problem, drastically reducing computational complexity. Empirical validation on historical stock price data demonstrates superior performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns and downside risk compared to conventional strategies. This framework generalizes classical mean-variance optimization by incorporating robustness considerations, offering a systematic and efficient solution for robust trading under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Fairness-Oriented Reinforcement Learning Approach for the Operation and Control of Shared Micromobility Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Machine Learning grows in popularity across various fields, equity has become a key focus for the AI community. However, fairness-oriented approaches are still underexplored in smart mobility. Addressing this gap, our study investigates the balance between performance optimization and algorithmic fairness in shared micromobility services providing a novel framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Exploiting Q-learning, the proposed methodology achieves equitable outcomes in terms of the Gini index across different areas characterized by their distance from central hubs. Through vehicle rebalancing, the provided scheme maximizes operator performance while ensuring fairness principles for users, reducing iniquity by up to 85% while only increasing costs by 30% (w.r.t. applying no equity adjustment). A case study with synthetic data validates our insights and highlights the importance of fairness in urban micromobility (source code: https://github.com/mcederle99/FairMSS.git).</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions for Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Reset Control with Application to Mechatronics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reset control enhances the performance of high-precision mechatronics systems. This paper introduces a generalized reset feedback control structure that integrates a single reset-state reset controller, a shaping filter for tuning reset actions, and linear compensators arranged in series and parallel configurations with the reset controller. This structure offers greater tuning flexibility to optimize reset control performance. However, frequency-domain analysis for such systems remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, this study makes three key contributions: (1) developing Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) for open-loop reset control systems; (2) deriving HOSIDFs for closed-loop reset control systems and establishing a connection with open-loop analysis; and (3) creating a MATLAB-based App to implement these methods, providing mechatronics engineers with a practical tool for reset control system design and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed methods is validated through simulations and experiments. Finally, the utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated through case studies that analyze and compare the performance of three controllers: a PID controller, a reset controller, and a shaped reset controller on a precision motion stage. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the shaped reset controller provides higher tracking precision while reducing actuation forces, outperforming both the reset and PID controllers. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain methods in analyzing and optimizing the performance of reset-controlled mechatronics systems.</description>

      <title>Automated monitoring of bee colony movement in the hive during winter season</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have experimentally modelled the movement of a bee colony in a hive during the winter season and developed a monitoring system that allows tracking the movement of the bee colony and honey consumption. The monitoring system consists of four load cells connected to the RP2040 controller based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, from which data is transmitted via the MQTT protocol to the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer via a Wi-Fi network. The processed data from the Raspberry Pi 5 is recorded in a MySQL database. The algorithm for finding the location of the bee colony in the hive works correctly, the trajectory of movement based on the data from the sensors repeats the physical movement in the experiment, which is an imitation of the movement of the bee colony in real conditions. The proposed monitoring system provides continuous observation of the bee colony without adversely affecting its natural activities and can be integrated with various wireless data networks. This is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of beekeeping and maintaining the health of bee colonies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viewing stochastic processes through the lens of occupation measures has proved to be a powerful angle of attack for the theoretical and computational analysis of stochastic optimal control problems. We present a simple modification of the traditional occupation measure framework derived from resolving the occupation measures locally on a partition of the control problem's space-time domain. This notion of local occupation measures provides fine-grained control over the construction of structured semidefinite programming relaxations for a rich class of stochastic optimal control problems with embedded diffusion and jump processes via the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy. As such, it bridges the gap between discretization-based approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equations and occupation measure relaxations. We demonstrate with examples that this approach enables the computation of high quality bounds for the optimal value of a large class of stochastic optimal control problems with significant performance gains relative to the traditional occupation measure framework.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamical Systems by Leveraging Data from Similar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the dynamics of a linear system when one has access to data generated by an auxiliary system that shares similar (but not identical) dynamics, in addition to data from the true system. We use a weighted least squares approach, and provide finite sample error bounds of the learned model as a function of the number of samples and various system parameters from the two systems as well as the weight assigned to the auxiliary data. We show that the auxiliary data can help to reduce the intrinsic system identification error due to noise, at the price of adding a portion of error that is due to the differences between the two system models. We further provide a data-dependent bound that is computable when some prior knowledge about the systems, such as upper bounds on noise levels and model difference, is available. This bound can also be used to determine the weight that should be assigned to the auxiliary data during the model training stage.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter and that the proportionality constant is upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that augmenting any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics with a feedforward prediction term ensures that the tracking error vanishes exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems: monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each case, we derive the sharpest-known contraction rates and provide explicit bounds on the tracking error between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on two numerical examples and on an application to control barrier function-based controller design that involves real hardware.</description>

      <title>AIaaS for ORAN-based 6G Networks: Multi-time Scale Slice Resource Management with DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses how to handle slice resources for 6G networks at different time scales in an architecture based on an open radio access network (ORAN). The proposed solution includes artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge of the network and applies two control-level loops to obtain optimal performance compared to other techniques. The ORAN facilitates programmable network architectures to support such multi-time scale management using AI approaches. The proposed algorithms analyze the maximum utilization of resources from slice performance to take decisions at the inter-slice level. Inter-slice intelligent agents work at a non-real-time level to reconfigure resources within various slices. Further than meeting the slice requirements, the intra-slice objective must also include the minimization of maximum resource utilization. This enables smart utilization of the resources within each slice without affecting slice performance. Here, each xApp that is an intra-slice agent aims at meeting the optimal quality of service (QoS) of the users, but at the same time, some inter-slice objectives should be included to coordinate intra- and inter-slice agents. This is done without penalizing the main intra-slice objective. All intelligent agents use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to meet their objectives. We have presented results for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) slice categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for mobile robot navigation in dynamic, unknown environments, leveraging onboard sensing and distributionally robust optimization to impose probabilistic safety constraints. Our method introduces a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) that directly integrates noisy sensor measurements and state estimates to define safety constraints. This approach is applicable to a wide range of control-affine dynamics, generalizable to robots with complex geometries, and capable of operating at real-time control frequencies. Coupled with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path following, the proposed CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, robust, and efficient navigation in challenging environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for safe autonomous navigation under uncertainty in simulations and real-world experiments with differential-drive robots.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multi-hop Traffic Pressure for Heterogeneous Traffic Perimeter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perimeter control (PC) prevents loss of traffic network capacity due to congestion in urban areas. Homogeneous PC allows all access points to a protected region to have identical permitted inflow. However, homogeneous PC performs poorly when the congestion in the protected region is heterogeneous (e.g., imbalanced demand) since the homogeneous PC does not consider specific traffic conditions around each perimeter intersection. When the protected region has spatially heterogeneous congestion, one needs to modulate the perimeter inflow rate to be higher near low-density regions and vice versa for high-density regions. A na\"ive approach is to leverage 1-hop traffic pressure to measure traffic condition around perimeter intersections, but such metric is too spatially myopic for PC. To address this issue, we formulate multi-hop downstream pressure grounded on Markov chain theory, which ``looks deeper'' into the protected region beyond perimeter intersections. In addition, we formulate a two-stage hierarchical control scheme that can leverage this novel multi-hop pressure to redistribute the total permitted inflow provided by a pre-trained deep reinforcement learning homogeneous control policy. Experimental results show that our heterogeneous PC approaches leveraging multi-hop pressure significantly outperform homogeneous PC in scenarios where the origin-destination flows are highly imbalanced with high spatial heterogeneity. Moveover, our approach is shown to be robust against turning ratio uncertainties by a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Visual collective behaviors on spherical robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of collective motion, traditionally, disregard the limited sensing capabilities of an individual, to instead assuming an omniscient perception of the environment. This study implements a visual flocking model in a ``robot-in-the-loop'' approach to reproduce these behaviors with a flock composed of 10 independent spherical robots. The model achieves robotic collective motion by only using panoramic visual information of each robot, such as retinal position, optical size and optic flow of the neighboring robots. We introduce a virtual anchor to confine the collective robotic movements so to avoid wall interactions. For the first time, a simple visual robot-in-the-loop approach succeed in reproducing several collective motion phases, in particular, swarming, and milling. Another milestone achieved with by this model is bridging the gap between simulation and physical experiments by demonstrating nearly identical behaviors in both environments with the same visual model. To conclude, we show that our minimal visual collective motion model is sufficient to recreate most collective behaviors on a robot-in-the-loop system that is scalable, behaves as numerical simulations predict and is easily comparable to traditional models.</description>

      <title>Near Optimal Approximations and Finite Memory Policies for POMPDs with Continuous Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an approximation method for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with continuous spaces. Belief MDP reduction, which has been the standard approach to study POMDPs requires rigorous approximation methods for practical applications, due to the state space being lifted to the space of probability measures. Generalizing recent work, in this paper we present rigorous approximation methods via discretizing the observation space and constructing a fully observed finite MDP model using a finite length history of the discrete observations and control actions. We show that the resulting policy is near-optimal under some regularity assumptions on the channel, and under certain controlled filter stability requirements for the hidden state process. Furthermore, by quantizing the measurements, we are able to utilize refined filter stability conditions. We also provide a Q learning algorithm that uses a finite memory of discretized information variables, and prove its convergence to the optimality equation of the finite fully observed MDP constructed using the approximation method.</description>

Abstract: Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Robust Autonomous Highway Ramp Entry</title>

Abstract: Vehicles today can drive themselves on highways and driverless robotaxis operate in major cities, with more sophisticated levels of autonomous driving expected to be available and become more common in the future. Yet, technically speaking, so-called "Level 5" (L5) operation, corresponding to full autonomy, has not been achieved. For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous highway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably robust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a highway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to minimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging (ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to this problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with simulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal position during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends existing work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents) and does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic and ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established that collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully decentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that controllers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against idealized optimal controllers.</description>
