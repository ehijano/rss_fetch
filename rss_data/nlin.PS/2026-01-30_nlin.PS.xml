      <title>Experimental observation of ballistic correlations in integrable turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unequal-time correlation functions fundamentally characterize emergent statistical properties in complex systems, yet their direct measurement in experiments is challenging. We report the experimental observation of two-time, ballistic correlations in a photonic platform governed by the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Using a recirculating optical fiber loop with heterodyne field detection, we acquire the full space-time dynamics of partially coherent optical waves and extract the intensity correlator in stationary states of integrable turbulence. The correlators collapse under ballistic rescaling and quantitatively agree with predictions from Generalized Hydrodynamics evaluated using the density of states obtained via inverse scattering analysis of the recorded fields. Our results provide a direct, parameter-free test of GHD in an integrable waves system.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Excitable Neuronal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact coherent structures as building blocks of turbulence on large domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact unstable solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are thought to underpin the dynamics of turbulence, but are usually computed in minimal computational domains. Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures.</description>
