      <title>Specification tests for regression models with measurement errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new specification tests for regression models with measurement errors in the explanatory variables. Inspired by the integrated conditional moment (ICM) approach, we use a deconvoluted residual-marked empirical process and construct ICM-type test statistics based on it. The issue of measurement errors is addressed by applying a deconvolution kernel estimator in constructing the residuals. We demonstrate that employing an orthogonal projection onto the tangent space of nuisance parameters not only eliminates the parameter estimation effect but also facilitates the simulation of critical values via a computationally simple multiplier bootstrap procedure. It is the first time a multiplier bootstrap has been proposed in the literature of specification testing with measurement errors. We also develop specification tests and the multiplier bootstrap procedure when the measurement error distribution is unknown. The finite-sample performance of the proposed tests for both known and unknown measurement error distributions is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Price-Based Attention and Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To choose between two discrete goods, a consumer pays attention to only those with prices below a threshold. From these, she chooses her most preferred good. We assume consumers in a population have the same preference but may have different thresholds. Similar models of bounded rationality have been studied in the empirical marketing literature. We fully characterize the model, and using observational choice data alone, we identify the welfare implications of a price change. The behavioral content of our model overlaps with an important class of random utility models, but the welfare implications are meaningfully different. The distribution of equivalent variation under our model first-order stochastically dominates that under the random utility model.</description>

      <title>Riesz Regression As Direct Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al., 2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat- ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF, Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).</description>

      <title>Where to Experiment? Site Selection Under Distribution Shift via Optimal Transport and Wasserstein DRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should researchers select experimental sites when the deployment population differs from observed data? I formulate the problem of experimental site selection as an optimal transport problem, developing methods to minimize downstream estimation error by choosing sites that minimize the Wasserstein distance between population and sample covariate distributions. I develop new theoretical upper bounds on PATE and CATE estimation errors, and show that these different objectives lead to different site selection strategies. I extend this approach by using Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization to develop a site selection procedure robust to adversarial perturbations of covariate information: a specific model of distribution shift. I also propose a novel data-driven procedure for selecting the uncertainty radius the Wasserstein DRO problem, which allows the user to benchmark robustness levels against observed variation in their data. Simulation evidence, and a reanalysis of a randomized microcredit experiment in Morocco (Cr\'epon et al.), show that these methods outperform random and stratified sampling of sites when covariates have prognostic R-squared &gt; .5, and alternative optimization methods i) for moderate-to-large size problem instances ii) when covariates are moderately informative about treatment effects, and iii) under induced distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Grouped fixed effects regularization for binary choice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the application of the grouped fixed effects approach to binary choice models for panel data in presence of severe complete separation. Through data loss, complete separation may lead to biased estimates of Average Partial Effects and imprecise inference. Moreover, forecasts are not available for units without variability in the response configuration. The grouped fixed effects approach discretizes unobserved heterogeneity via k-means clustering, thus reducing the number of fixed effects to estimate. This regularization reduces complete separation, since it relies on within-cluster rather than within-subject response transitions. Drawing from asymptotic theory for the APEs, we propose choosing a number of groups such that clustering delivers a good approximation of the latent trait while keeping the incidental parameters problem under control. The simulation results show that the proposed approach delivers unbiased estimates and reliable inference for the APEs. Two empirical applications illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of the number of groups and how nontrivial forecasts for a much larger number of units can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting demand estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper clarifies how and why structural demand models (Berry and Haile, 2014, 2024) predict unit-level counterfactual outcomes. We do so by casting structural assumptions equivalently as restrictions on the joint distribution of potential outcomes. Our reformulation highlights a counterfactual homogeneity assumption underlying structural demand models: The relationship between counterfactual outcomes is assumed to be identical across markets. This assumption is strong, but cannot be relaxed without sacrificing identification of market-level counterfactuals. Absent this assumption, we can interpret model-based predictions as extrapolations from certain causally identified average treatment effects. This reinterpretation provides a conceptual bridge between structural modeling and causal inference.</description>

      <title>Uniform Quasi ML based inference for the panel AR(1) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes new inference methods for panel AR models with arbitrary initial conditions and heteroskedasticity and possibly additional regressors that are robust to the strength of identification. Specifically, we consider several Maximum Likelihood based methods of constructing tests and confidence sets (CSs) and show that (Quasi) LM tests and CSs that use the expected Hessian rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood have correct asymptotic size (in a uniform sense). We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects version of such a LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with the maximal attainable power curve in the worst case setting. We also study the empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and CSs.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Analysis: review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over a century canonical correlations, variables, and related concepts have been studied across various fields, with contributions dating back to Jordan [1875] and Hotelling [1936]. This text surveys the evolution of canonical correlation analysis, a fundamental statistical tool, beginning with its foundational theorems and progressing to recent developments and open research problems. Along the way we introduce and review methods, notions, and fundamental concepts from linear algebra, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics, placing particular emphasis on rigorous mathematical treatment.
  The survey is intended for technically proficient graduate students and other researchers with an interest in this area. The content is organized into five chapters, supplemented by six sets of exercises found in Chapter 6. These exercises introduce additional material, reinforce key concepts, and serve to bridge ideas across chapters. We recommend the following sequence: first, solve Problem Set 0, then proceed with Chapter 1, solve Problem Set 1, and so on through the text.</description>
