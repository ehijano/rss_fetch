      <title>Energy-Resolved Real-Space Imaging of Orbital Nematicity in an Fe-Based Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic nematicity in Fe-based superconductors is manifested by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking and the formation of nematic domains with mutually orthogonal directions of $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ orbital anisotropy. However, its energy dependence has remained largely unexplored in real space. Using 5.82-eV laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) with an energy-selective slit, we visualize the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast within individual nematic domains of Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($x\approx0.08$). We discover a sign reversal of the LD contrast at an energy $\sim0.4$ eV below the Fermi level, directly revealing an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain. This behavior reflects a different energy-dependent redistribution of spectral weight between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ states, highlighting the crucial role of orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase of Fe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Superconductivity in Janus MoXH Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus hydrogenated transition metal chalcogenides provide an unusual platform where lattice instabilities, electron-phonon coupling, and superconductivity are strongly intertwined. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that Janus 2H and 1T MoXH (X = S, Se) monolayers host an intrinsic, commensurate charge density wave (CDW) ground state originating from soft phonon modes at the Brillouin zone M point. Real-space supercell optimizations confirm that the CDW reconstruction lowers the total energy and fully stabilizes the lattice, eliminating the imaginary phonon modes present in the high-symmetry metallic structures. Analysis of the electronic susceptibility shows that the CDW instability is not driven by Fermi surface nesting, but instead arises from strong electron-phonon coupling. We further reveal a material-dependent interplay between CDW order and superconductivity. In 1T MoSH, CDW formation enhances low-energy phonon contributions and strengthens electron-phonon coupling, leading to an increased superconducting transition temperature. In contrast, for 1T MoSeH and 2H MoSeH, the CDW phase suppresses electron-phonon coupling and reduces superconductivity. Finally, we show that thermal fluctuations, compressive strain, and carrier doping can selectively suppress CDW order and restore superconductivity. These results establish Janus MoXH monolayers as a tunable two-dimensional system for exploring lattice-driven charge ordering and its competition with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electron-Phonon Coupling and Superconductivity in Ba-Alloyed A15 LaH5.75</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established rare earth A15 type hydrides as a distinct family of high temperature superconductors that can be stabilized at significantly lower pressures compared to other superconducting hydrides. In particular, A15 type LaH5.75 was recently shown to be a high Tc superconductor. We have investigated a range of ternary substitutions and demonstrate that partial substitution of La by Ba stabilizes the A15 hydride lattice, with La0.75Ba0.25H5.75 identified as a stable compound. We calculate a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 183 K, almost double that of LaH5.75 at similar pressures. Ba typically acts as a 2 plus ion, while La is 3 plus. The reduced electron count disrupts the formation of H2 units and shifts the Fermi surface, leading to strongly enhanced electron phonon coupling. By contrast, substitution with Hf fails to produce any stable compounds. This work extends emerging alloy design principles in A15 hydride superconductors, demonstrating that doping can shift the Fermi level and tune the strength of the electron phonon coupling. These results provide concrete guidance for the experimental realization of new high Tc phases.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure reconstruction in Ni$_{x}$ZrTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filling of the large van der Waals gap in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) often leads to lattice and electronic instabilities, which prelude the onset of a rich phenomenology. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\approx-0.7$ eV and $\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\pi)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction. Our findings invite further investigation into the structural properties of ZrTe$_2$ and of the intercalated and defect-engineered versions of this material.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the intimate connection between magnetic orders and the interplay among multiple degrees of freedom in heavy-fermion systems, controlling and understanding the associated inverse melting effect is crucial for unveiling novel condensed-matter states and their potential applications. Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance of Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ in the Two-Dimensional Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors. The fabrication and characterization techniques demonstrated here are extensible to the investigation of other two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Extreme Anisotropy in the Metallic and Superconducting Phases of Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated electronic systems, Coulomb interactions frequently manifest through emergent electronic orders that spontaneously break rotational symmetry. Understanding how such symmetry breaking intertwines with other collective phenomena -- such as unconventional superconductivity -- and how it shapes experimental observables, particularly transport responses, remains a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report a metallic phase with extreme transport anisotropy in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, with an anisotropy ratio rivaling that of quantum Hall stripe phases. At low temperature, a superconducting state emerges from this metallic phase. Strikingly, the superconductor not only inherits strong anisotropy but also exhibits a wide range of hysteretic transitions arising from the tunability of the underlying anisotropic order. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized coexistence between superconductivity and extreme transport anisotropy, shedding new light on the role of rotational symmetry breaking in shaping unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>
