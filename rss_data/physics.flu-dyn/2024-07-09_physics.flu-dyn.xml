      <title>Direction Symmetry of Wave Field Modulation by Tidal Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the modulation of unidimensional regular waves over a flat bottom due to a current typically assign an asymmetry between the effects of opposing/following streams on the evolution of major sea variables, such as significant wave height. The significant wave height is expected to monotonically increase with opposing streams and to decrease with following streams. To some extent, observations on data sets containing a few thousand of waves or over a continuous series of about a day confirm this prediction. Here, based on a multi-year dataset, we show that in very broad-banded seas with high directional spread, the asymptotic behavior of sea variables is highly non-trivial and does not follow the theoretical predictions, especially at high values of the ratio between tidal stream and group speed.</description>

      <title>Minimal droplet shape representation in experimental microfluidics using Fourier series and autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-step, fully reversible process designed to project the outer shape of a generic droplet onto a lower-dimensional space. The initial step involves representing the droplet's shape as a Fourier series. Subsequently, the Fourier coefficients are reduced to lower-dimensional vectors by using autoencoder models. The exploitation of the domain knowledge of the droplet shapes allows us to map generic droplet shapes to just 2D space in contrast to previous direct methods involving autoencoders that could map it on minimum 8D space. This 6D reduction in the dimensionality of the droplet's description opens new possibilities for applications, such as automated droplet generation via reinforcement learning, the analysis of droplet shape evolution dynamics and the prediction of droplet breakup. Our findings underscore the benefits of incorporating domain knowledge into autoencoder models, highlighting the potential for increased accuracy in various other scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Swimming Cylinder Wake Control with Plasma Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on controlling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using an advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic equations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution domain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This force is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number of the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady manner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its time-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are symmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream, both above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator placement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The results indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the cylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift coefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings reveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared to the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the 90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation initiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and applying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow control on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of the second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in downstream flow quality of 20% to 26%.</description>

      <title>Effect of sweep angle on three-dimensional vortex dynamics over plunging wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of sweep angle and reduced frequency on the leading-edge vortex (LEV) structure over flapping swept wings in the Reynolds number ($Re$) range of $\mathbf{O}(10^4)$ are yet to be completely understood. With increasing interest in designing bio-inspired micro-air-vehicles (MAVs), understanding LEV dynamics in such scenarios is imperative. This study investigates the effects of three different sweep angles ($\Lambda = 0^\circ$, $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$) on LEV dynamics through high-fidelity improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) to analyze the underlying flow physics. Plunge ramp kinematics at two different reduced frequencies ($k = 0.05$ and $0.4$) are studied to investigate the unsteady motion effects on LEV characteristics. The leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) concept is applied to determine LEV initiation, and the results are verified against flow field visualization for swept-wing geometries. The force partitioning method (FPM) is used to investigate the spanwise lift distribution resulting from the LEV. Distinct peaks in the lift coefficient occur for the high reduced frequency case due to the impulse-like plunging acceleration. This causes the LEV to detach from the leading edge more quickly and convect faster, significantly affecting the lift generated by the wing. As reduced frequency increases, the LEV breakdown mechanism switches from vortex bursting to LEV leg-induced instabilities. These results provide insights into the complex vortex structures surrounding swept wings at $Re = 20,000$, and the impact both sweep angle and reduced frequency have on the lift contribution of these flow features.</description>

      <title>Laminar-Turbulent Patterns in Shear Flows : Evasion of Tipping, Saddle-Loop Bifurcation and Log scaling of the Turbulent Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a one-dimensional two-scalar fields reaction advection diffusion model for the globally subcritical transition to turbulence. In this model, the homogeneous turbulent state is disconnected from the laminar one and disappears in a tipping catastrophe scenario. The model however exhibits a linear instability of the turbulent homogeneous state, mimicking the onset of the laminar-turbulent patterns observed in the transitional regime of wall shear flows. Numerically continuing the solutions obtained at large Reynolds numbers, we construct the Busse balloon associated with the multistability of the nonlinear solutions emerging from the instability. In the core of the balloon, the turbulent fluctuations, encoded into a multiplicative noise, select the pattern wavelength. On the lower Reynolds number side of the balloon, the pattern follows a cascade of destabilizations towards larger and larger, eventually infinite wavelengths. In that limit, the periodic limit cycle associated with the spatial pattern hits the laminar fixed point, resulting in a saddle-loop global bifurcation and the emergence of solitary pulse solutions. This saddle-loop scenario predicts a logarithmic divergence of the wavelength, which captures experimental and numerical data in two representative shear flows.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer enhancement by mist/air two-phase flow in a high-temperature channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mist/air two-phase flow is a promising cooling technique for many applications such as internal cooling of gas turbine blades. A significant enhancement of heat transfer can be achieved with a low mass fraction of droplets by utilizing the latent heat of the droplets. Using newly designed atomizers to accurately control the mist droplets, this study experimentally explores the heat transfer performance of mist/air flow in a high-temperature channel with a maximum temperature of 880 K. The effects of the mist/air mass ratio, droplet size, Reynolds number, and wall heat flux are studied. The results show that the cooling performance of the test section can be significantly improved by even adding a small amount of droplets. Considering mist droplets of different sizes, larger droplets can cause more remarkable temperature reduction, while smaller droplets can improve the uniformity of temperature distribution. For large droplets, the cooling effect in the upstream is more obvious than that in the downstream due to the interaction between the wall and the droplets, and with the increase of mist/air mass ratio, the area with obvious cooling extends downstream. The performance of mist/air cooling is tested by increasing the heat flux until the maximum temperature at the outlet reaches a predetermined value. Compared with air-only cooling, the increment in the wall heat flux by the mist/air cooling with a mass ratio of 3% can be up to 18.4%.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Balance in the Tornado Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the thermodynamics of the initial formation (genesis) of tornado-like vortices. In particular, it discusses how the thermodynamics of discrete vortices in a two-dimensional (thin three-dimensional boundary) layer drives the creation of ``hairpins,'' their two-dimensional rearrangement, and stretching of vorticity in the vertical direction inside a turbulent boundary layer that leads to a tornado-like flow. Turbulence of that process is analyzed with the help of the vortex filament model and its connection to the fluid flow equations via the Hasimoto and Madelung transforms of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Finally, a formula for the non-equilibrium entropy flux associated with the development of two-dimensional turbulence in the boundary layer is provided.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced drop size and distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an integral analysis of conservation equations of mass and energy, to determine the drop size and distributions during shock-induced drop break-up. The result is an updated form for the drop size as a function of its final velocity, from a series of work applied to various atomization geometries. Comparisons with experimental data demonstrate the validity and utility of this method. The shock-induced drop size and distributions can be predicted within reasonable accuracy as a function of the drop velocity ratio and fluid properties. The result also illustrates the dynamical process of kinetic energy deficit transferred to the surface tension energy, and the skewing of the drop size distribution due to the non-linear dependence on velocity ratio.</description>

      <title>Effect of a shear flow on the Darrieus--Landau instability in a Hele-Shaw channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Darrieus--Landau instability of premixed flames propagating in a narrow Hele-Shaw channel in the presence of a strong shear flow is investigated, incorporating also the Rayleigh--Taylor and diffusive-thermal instabilities. The flow induces shear-enhanced diffusion (Taylor dispersion) in the streamwise direction, but not in the spanwise direction and this leads to anisotropic diffusion and flame propagation. To understand how such anisotropies affect flame stability, two important cases are considered. These correspond to initial unperturbed conditions pertaining to a planar flame propagating in the streamwise or spanwise directions. The analysis is based on a two-dimensional model derived by asymptotic methods and solved numerically. These address the influence of the shear-flow strength (or Peclet number $Pe$), preferential diffusion (or Lewis number $Le$) and gravity (or Rayleigh number $Ra$). Dispersion curves characterizing the perturbation growth rate are computed for selected values of $Pe$, $Le$ and $Ra$. Taylor dispersion induced by strong shear flows is found to suppress the Darrieus--Landau instability and to weaken the flame wrinkling when the flame propagates in the streamwise direction. In contrast, when the flame propagates in the spanwise direction, the flame is stabilized in $Le&lt;1$ mixtures, but destabilized in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures. In the latter case, Taylor dispersion coupled with gas expansion facilitates flame wrinkling in an unusual manner. Specifically, stagnation points and counter-rotating vortices are encountered in the flame close to the unburnt gas side. More generally, an original finding is the demonstration that vorticity can be produced by a curved flame in a Hele-Shaw channel even in the absence of gravity, whenever $Pe \neq 0$, and that the vorticity remains confined to the flame preheat and reaction zones.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional diffusive-thermal instability of flames propagating in a plane Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional diffusive-thermal stability of a two-dimensional flame propagating in a Poiseuille flow is examined. The study explores the effect of three non-dimensional parameters, namely the Lewis number $Le$, the Damk\"ohler number $Da$, and the flow Peclet number $Pe$. Wide ranges of the Lewis number and the flow amplitude are covered, as well as conditions corresponding to small-scale narrow ($Da \ll 1$) to large-scale wide ($Da \gg 1$) channels. The instability experienced by the flame appears as a combination of the traditional diffusive-thermal instability of planar flames and the recently identified instability corresponding to a transition from symmetric to asymmetric flame. The instability regions are identified in the $Le$-$Pe$ plane for selected values of $Da$ by computing the eigenvalues of a linear stability problem. These are complemented by two- and three-dimensional time-dependent simulations describing the full evolution of unstable flames into the non-linear regime. In narrow channels, flames are found to be always symmetric about the mid-plane of the channel. Additionally, in these situations, shear flow-induced Taylor dispersion enhances the cellular instability in $Le&lt;1$ mixtures and suppresses the oscillatory instability in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures. In large-scale channels, however, both the cellular and the oscillatory instabilities are expected to persist. Here, the flame has a stronger propensity to become asymmetric when the mean flow opposes its propagation and when $Le&lt;1$; if the mean flow facilitates the flame propagation, then the flame is likely to remain symmetric about the channel mid-plane. For $Le&gt;1$, both symmetric and asymmetric flames are encountered and are accompanied by temporal oscillations.</description>

      <title>Shear-Layer Perturbation Responses from Time-Resolved Schlieren Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel combination of physics-based and data-driven post-processing techniques is proposed to extract acoustic-related shear-layer perturbation responses directly from spatio-temporally resolved schlieren video. The physics-based component is derived from a momentum potential theory extension that extracts irrotational (acoustic and thermal) information from density gradients embedded in schlieren pixel intensities. For the unheated shear layer, the method spotlights acoustic structures and tones otherwise hidden. The filtered data is then subjected to a data-driven Dynamic Mode Decomposition Reduced Order Model (DMD-ROM), which provides the response to forced perturbations. This method applies a learned linear model to isolate and quantify growth rates of acoustic phenomena suited for efficient parametric studies. A shear-layer comprised of two streams at Mach 2.461 and 0.175, corresponding to a convective Mach number 0.88 and containing shocks, is adopted for illustration. The overall perturbation response is first obtained using an impulse forcing in the wall normal direction of the splitter plate, extending in both subsonic and supersonic streams. Subsequently, impulse and harmonic forcings are independently applied in a local pixel-by-pixel manner for a precise receptivity study. The acoustic response shows a convective wavepacket and an acoustic burst from the splitter plate. The interaction with the primary shock and associated wave dispersion emits a second, slower, acoustic wave. Harmonic forcing indicates higher frequency-dependent sensitivity in the supersonic stream, with the most sensitive location near the outer boundary layer region. Excitation here yields an order of magnitude larger acoustic response compared to disturbances in the subsonic stream. Some receptive forcing inputs do not generate significant acoustic waves, which may guide excitation with low noise impact.</description>

      <title>A consistent, volume preserving, and adaptive mesh refinement-based framework for modeling non-isothermal gas-liquid-solid flows with phase change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work expands on our recently introduced low Mach enthalpy method [1] for simulating the melting and solidification of a phase change material (PCM) alongside (or without) an ambient gas phase. The method captures PCM's volume change (shrinkage or expansion) by accounting for density change-induced flows. We present several improvements to the original work. First, we introduce consistent time integration schemes for the mass, momentum, and enthalpy equations, which enhance the method stability. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this scheme, we show that a system free of external forces and heat sources can conserve its initial mass, momentum, enthalpy, and phase composition. This allows the system to transition from a non-isothermal, non-equilibrium, phase-changing state to an isothermal, equilibrium state without exhibiting unrealistic behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low Mach enthalpy method accurately simulates thermocapillary flows without introducing spurious phase changes. We propose an analytical model to validate advanced CFD codes for simulating metal manufacturing processes like welding and 3D printing. These processes involve a heat source melting metal or alloy in an inert gas environment. Traditionally, validation relied on manipulating material properties to match complex experiments. Our model uses the Stefan problem with a density jump to provide a straightforward method for validating multiphysics simulations involving heat sources and phase changes in three-phase flows.Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of the method in modeling porosity defects (gas bubble trapping) during metal solidification. A field extension technique is used to accurately apply surface tension forces in a three-phase flow situation. This is where part of the bubble surface is trapped within the (moving) solidification front.</description>

      <title>The vertical-velocity skewness in the inertial sublayer of turbulent wall flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide empirical evidence that within the inertial sub layer of adiabatic turbulent flows over smooth walls, the skewness of the vertical velocity component $Sk_w$ displays universal behaviour, being constant and constrained within the range $Sk_w \approx 0.1-0.16$, regardless of flow configuration and Reynolds number. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the observed behaviour, including the observed range of variations of $Sk_w$. The model clarifies why $Sk_w$ cannot be predicted from down-gradient closure approximations routinely employed in meteorological and climate models whereby $Sk_w$ impacts cloud formation and dispersion processes. The model also offers an alternative and implementable approach.</description>

      <title>Micro Plasma Actuator Location Effect on Complex Fluidic Behavior: An Optimization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs optimization techniques to enhance the positioning of a dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator on a curved surface, taking into account diverse aerodynamic and physical scenarios. The optimization methodology utilized here is Differential Evolution (DE), complemented by an improved electrostatic model for solving electrostatic equations. In this electrostatic model, two elliptic equations, governing electrical potential and plasma density, are independently resolved, and their solutions are subsequently incorporated as source terms within the Navier-Stokes equations. Notably, contrary to prior research suggesting the placement of the plasma actuator at the leading edge of the airfoil, our findings reveal that the optimal position for plasma actuation falls within the range of 2 to 4 percent of the chord length from the leading edge, contingent upon the prevailing aerodynamic conditions. Furthermore, we elucidate a mathematical pattern in the optimization data across a continuous domain, applicable to various geometries and designs. This mathematical model articulates the optimal location as a complex function, dependent on both the linear Reynolds effect and the angular impact of the angle of attack.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones, robots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of total power available onboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably reducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge. Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect and process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be solved using the traditional computing devices since they become more and more power-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives of development of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a biological brain using nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical environments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also demonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct computations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less than 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs is a semi-classical technology, their technical simplicity and low, compared with quantum computers, cost make them ideally suitable for application in autonomous AI system. Providing a perspective view on the future progress in unconventional physical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200 interdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad readership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics, engineering, quantum technologies and computing.</description>

Abstract: The paper continues to study the long-standing problem of quasi 1-D (one dimensional) spectrum of sea surface wave turbulence. The study is based on Hasselmann's kinetic equation, which significantly simplifies for the quasi 1-D turbulence. The goal of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental observations. The paper starts with new derivation of the quasi 1-D approximation of Hasselmann's equation. The present work does not support the imposition of boundary conditions. Instead, the family of theoretical spectra is compared with P-M (Pierson-Moskowitz) and JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectra. First, a simple solution (first approximation) of the quasi 1-D equation is obtained and compared with the P-M spectrum. Then self-similar solutions are considered; they are shown to satisfy the second order ordinary differential equation. The solutions of this equation have many features of the JONSWAP spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</description>

      <title>Vortex reversal is a precursor of confined bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active turbulence, or chaotic self-organized collective motion, is often observed in concentrated suspensions of motile bacteria and other systems of self-propelled interacting agents. To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have discovered a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well's radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the severity of tandem coronary stenoses: Insights from simulated FFR and iFR techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of coronary tandem lesions poses a significant challenge for the accurate diagnosis and management of coronary artery diseases. This study set out to provide a deeper understanding of the haemodynamic interactions between tandem obstructive coronary lesions and their impact on different haemodynamic diagnostic parameters. Methods and Results: Using a computational fluid dynamic model, validated against in vitro laboratory experiments, we investigated the various combinations of moderate and severe stenoses interchangeably located in the proximal and distal segments of the artery. The investigation was conducted using two diagnostic parameters: one hyperaemic-based, i.e., FFR, and one rest-based, i.e., iFR, technique, both of which are commonly used to assess the physiological significance of coronary stenoses. The three main findings of this work are: (a) the recovery distance (the immediate local distance affected by the presence of stenosis) is much shorter for the rest-measured diagnostic parameter compared with the hyperaemic-measured diagnostic parameter; (b) pressure drop measurements immediately downstream of the stenotic sections overestimate the significance of stenoses, and (c) the presence of a moderate stenosis downstream of a severe stenosis increases FFR value (faster FFR recovery). Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of the diagnostic accuracy of hyperaemic-based and rest-based physiological diagnostic coronary assessments and the nuances of using these different techniques when assessing tandem coronary stenoses. This understanding can help inform tailored therapeutic approaches for the management of coronary artery disease.</description>

      <title>The Energy Balance of a Hydraulic Fracture at Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail the energy balance of a propagating hydraulic fracture. Using the linear hydraulic fracture model which combines lubrication flow and linear elastic fracture mechanics, we demonstrate how different propagation regimes are related to the dominance of a given term of the power balance of a growing hydraulic fracture. Taking an energy point of view allows us to offer a physical explanation of hydraulic fracture growth behaviours, such as, for example, the transition from viscosity to toughness dominated growth for a radial geometry, fracture propagation after the end of the injection or transition to self-buoyant elongated growth. We quantify the evolution of the different power terms for a series of numerical examples. We also discuss the order of magnitudes of the different terms for a industrial-like hydraulic fracturing treatment accounting for the additional dissipation in the injection line.</description>

      <title>Primordial acoustic turbulence: three-dimensional simulations and gravitational wave predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling Framework using Element-based Galerkin Methods for Moist Atmospheric Limited-Area Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale modeling framework (MMF) to model moist atmospheric limited-area weather. The MMF resolves large-scale convection using a coarse grid while simultaneously resolving local features through numerous fine local grids and coupling them seamlessly. Both large- and small-scale processes are modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations within the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), and they are discretized using a continuous element-based Galerkin method (spectral elements) with high-order basis functions. Consequently, the large-scale and small-scale models share the same dynamical core but have the flexibility to be adjusted individually. The proposed MMF method is tested in 2D and 3D idealized limited-area weather problems involving storm clouds produced by squall line and supercell simulations. The MMF numerical results showed enhanced representation of cloud processes compared to the coarse model.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Dynamic Wetting Boundary Conditions for the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting behavior of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for binary-fluid flows as the diffuse-interface thickness passes to zero, in the presence of fluid-fluid-solid contact lines. Allowing for motion of such contact lines relative to the solid substrate is required to adequately model multi-phase and multi-species fluid transport past and through solid media. Even though diffuse-interface models provide an inherent slip mechanism through the mobility-induced diffusion, this slip vanishes as the interface thickness and mobility parameter tend to zero in the so-called sharp-interface limit. The objective of this work is to present dynamic wetting and generalized Navier boundary conditions for diffuse-interface models that are consistent in the sharp-interface limit. We concentrate our analysis on the prototypical binary-fluid Couette-flow problems. To verify the consistency of the diffuse-interface model in the limit of vanishing interface thickness, we provide reference limit solutions of a corresponding sharp-interface model. For parameter values both at and away from the critical viscosity ratio, we present and compare the results of both the diffuse- and sharp-interface models. The close match between both model results indicates that the considered test case lends itself well as a benchmark for further research.</description>

      <title>Threshold transient growth as a criterion for turbulent mean profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lozano-Duran et al (J. Fluid Mech., 914, A8, 2021) have recently identified the ability of streamwise-averaged turbulent streak fields $U(y,z,t)\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$ in minimal channels to produce short-term transient growth as the key linear mechanism needed to sustain turbulence at $Re_{\tau}=180$. Here, in an attempt to extend this result to larger domains and higher $Re_{\tau}$, we model this streak transient growth as a two-stage linear process by first selecting the dominant streak structure expected to emerge over the eddy turnover time on the turbulent mean profile $U(y)\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$, and then examining the secondary growth on this (frozen) streak field $U(y,z)\widehat{\mathbf{x}}$. Choosing the mean streak amplitude and eddy turnover time consistent with simulations captures the growth thresholds found by Lozano-Duran et al. (2021) for sustained turbulence. In a larger domain at $Re_{\tau}=180$, the most energetic near-wall streaks observed in simulations are close to the predicted optimal streaks. This most energetic streak spacing, approaches the optimal streak at $Re_{\tau}=550$ where the secondary growth possible on each also comes together. A key prediction from the model is that the threshold transient growth required to sustain turbulence decreases with increasing $Re_{\tau}$. More fundamentally, the work of Lozano-Duran et al. (2021) and our results suggest a subtle but significant revision of Malkus's (J. Fluid Mech.}, 521, 1, 1956) classic hypothesis concerning realisable turbulent mean profiles. The key property for a realisable turbulent mean profile could be the ability to generate sufficient short-term transient growth rather than dependence on its (long-term) linear stability characteristics which was Malkus's original idea.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that photophoretic aircraft would greatly benefit from a three-dimensional (3D) hollow geometry that pumps ambient air through sidewalls to create a high-speed jet. To identify optimal geometries, we developed a theoretical expression for the lift force based on both Stokes (low-Re) and momentum (high-Re) theory and validated it using finite-element fluid-dynamics simulations. We then systematically varied geometric parameters, including Knudsen pump porosity, to minimize the operating altitude or maximize the payload. Assuming that the large vehicles can be made from previously demonstrated nanocardboard material, the minimum altitude is 55 km while the payload can reach 1 kilogram for 3D structures with 10-meter diameter at 80 km altitude. In all cases, the maximum areal density of the sidewalls cannot exceed a few grams per square meter, demonstrating the need for ultralight porous materials.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed-form Equations for Subgrid-scale Closures from High-fidelity Data: Promises and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in discovering interpretable, closed-form equations for subgrid-scale (SGS) closures/parameterizations of complex processes in Earth systems. Here, we apply a common equation-discovery technique with expansive libraries to learn closures from filtered direct numerical simulations of 2D turbulence and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Across common filters (e.g., Gaussian, box), we robustly discover closures of the same form for momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of gradients of filtered variables, with constants that are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model (NGM), which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series. Indeed, we suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms, for many common systems/physics, discovered closures are consistent with the leading term of the Taylor-series (except when cutoff filters are used). Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy simulations with NGM closures are unstable, despite significant similarities between the true and NGM-predicted fluxes (correlations $&gt; 0.95$). We identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, NGM produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales, lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In RBC, potential energy backscattering is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that SGS fluxes diagnosed from data, presumed the ''truth'' for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures in future work, we propose several ideas around using physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are relevant to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal effect is essential to regulate the interfacial instabilities for diverse technology applications. Here we report the fingering instability at the propagation front for a spreading liquid film subjected to the supercooling at the vertical direction. We find the onset timescale of hydrodynamic instability is strongly correlated with that of the vertical solidification process. This correlation is further validated in a non-uniform geometry, demonstrating the capability of controlling fingering instability by structure design. We attribute the identified interfacial instability to a pronounced thermo-viscous effect, since the rapidly increased viscosity of propagation front undergoing solidification can significantly enhance the mobility contrast locally in the vicinity of the spreading front, consequently producing the instability analogous to viscous fingering. This work offers another valuable dimension by gating the vertical temperature to exploit the interfacial stabilities and steer liquid flow, consequently shedding light on the microfluidic cooling for electronics, and the advanced functional fibers and fabrics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Reynolds Shear Stress in Adverse Pressure-Gradient Flows, from the Lagrangian Transport Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Lagrangian transport analysis for the turbulence momentum, the Reynolds stress gradient can be expressed as a function of the local momentum flux and force terms. From this perspective of an observer moving at the local mean velocity, the Reynolds stress gradient represents the lateral transport of streamwise momentum, balanced by the u'2 transport, pressure and viscous force terms. Data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been used to validate this approach for adverse pressure-gradient boundary layer flows at Clauser parameter of 1.4 and 39 (Kitsios et al., 2017), with a good degree of consistency and agreements. Minute fluctuations and attributes in the Reynolds shear stress profile are replicated through the Lagrangian momentum equation. Gradient analysis also leads to scaling at the first- and second-derivative levels, for u'2, v'2 and u'v'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-sustained order can emerge in complex systems due to internal feedback between coupled subsystems. Here, we present our discovery of a non-monotonic emergence of order amidst chaos in a turbulent thermo-acoustic fluid system. Fluctuations play a vital role in determining the dynamical state and transitions in a system. In this work, we use complex networks to encode jumps in amplitude scales owing to fluctuations as links between nodes representing amplitude bins. The number of possible amplitude transitions at a fixed timescale reflects the complexity of dynamics at that timescale. The network entropy quantifies the number of and uncertainty associated with such transitions. Using network entropy, we show that the uncertainty in fluctuations first increases and then decreases as the system transitions from chaos via intermittency to order. The competition between turbulence and nonlinear interactions leads to such non-monotonic emergence of order amidst chaos in turbulent thermo-acoustic fluid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is omnipresent in modern engineering and scientific disciplines. SPH is a class of Lagrangian schemes that discretize fluid dynamics via finite material points that are tracked through the evolving velocity field. Due to the particle-like nature of the simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as appealing and successful surrogates. However, the practical utility of such GNN-based simulators relies on their ability to faithfully model physics, providing accurate and stable predictions over long time horizons - which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we identify particle clustering originating from tensile instabilities as one of the primary pitfalls. Based on these insights, we enhance both training and rollout inference of state-of-the-art GNN-based simulators with varying components from standard SPH solvers, including pressure, viscous, and external force components. All Neural SPH-enhanced simulators achieve better performance than the baseline GNNs, often by orders of magnitude in terms of rollout error, allowing for significantly longer rollouts and significantly better physics modeling.

      <title>JAX-SPH: A Differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-based fluid simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, especially in cases that include intricate physics and free surfaces. The recent addition of machine learning methods to the toolbox for solving such problems is pushing the boundary of the quality vs. speed tradeoff of such numerical simulations. In this work, we lead the way to Lagrangian fluid simulators compatible with deep learning frameworks, and propose JAX-SPH - a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework implemented in JAX. JAX-SPH builds on the code for dataset generation from the LagrangeBench project (Toshev et al., 2023) and extends this code in multiple ways: (a) integration of further key SPH algorithms, (b) restructuring the code toward a Python package, (c) verification of the gradients through the solver, and (d) demonstration of the utility of the gradients for solving inverse problems as well as a Solver-in-the-Loop application. Our code is available at https://github.com/tumaer/jax-sph.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Element Enrichment Wall-Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an enrichment wall-model within the spectral element method (SEM) framework for large-eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The method augments the polynomial solution in the wall-adjacent elements with an analytical law-of-the-wall enrichment function representing the mean velocity near the wall. In the solution representation, this enrichment function captures the large gradients in the boundary layer, which allows the polynomial modes to represent the turbulent fluctuations. The enriched solution is able to resolve the shear stress at the wall without any modification to the no-slip wall boundary conditions. The performance of the SEM enrichment wall-modeling approach is assessed in turbulent channel flow LES for a range of Reynolds numbers. The results show that the proposed method improves solution accuracy on under-resolved near-wall grids as compared to the traditional shear stress wall-models.</description>

      <title>2.5D turbulence in shear-thinning jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimensional transition in turbulent jets of a shear-thinning fluid is studied via direct numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that under vertical confinement, the flow exhibits a unique mixed-dimensional (or 2.5D) state, where large-scale two-dimensional and small-scale three-dimensional structures coexist. This transition from three-dimensional turbulence near the inlet to two-dimensional dynamics downstream is dictated by the level of confinement: weak confinement guarantees turbulence to remain three-dimensional, whereas strong confinement forces the transition to two-dimensions; the mixed-dimensional state is observed for moderate confinement and it emerges as soon as flow scales are larger than the vertical length. In this scenario, we observed that the mixed-dimensional state is an overall more energetic state and it shows a multi-cascade process, where the direct cascade of energy at small scales and the direct cascade of enstrophy at large scales coexist. The results provide insights into the complex dynamics of confined turbulent flows, relevant in both natural and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Curvature fluctuations of fluid vesicles reveal hydrodynamic dissipation within the bilayer</title>

Abstract: The biological function of membranes is closely related to their softness, which is often studied through the membranes' thermally-driven fluctuations. The analysis commonly assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of non-planar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman-Delbr\"uck length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of DPPC:Cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations, and show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:Cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology. Our study provides physical insights into the time scales of curvature remodeling of biological and synthetic membranes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions encompass a wide range of complex fluids containing microscale energy-injecting particles, such as cells, bacteria or artificially powered active colloids. Because they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, active suspensions can display a number of fascinating phenomena, including turbulent-like large-scale coherent motion and enhanced diffusion. Here, using a recently developed active Fast Stokesian Dynamics method, we present a detailed numerical study on the hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions. Specifically, we simulate suspensions of active but non-self-propelling spherical squirmers, of either puller- or pusher-type, at volume fractions from 0.5% to 55%. Our results show little difference between pullers and pushers in their instantaneous and long-time dynamics, where the translational dynamics vary non-monotonically with the volume fraction, with a peak diffusivity at around 10% to 20%, in stark contrast to suspensions of self-propelling particles. On the other hand, the rotational dynamics tend to increase with the volume fraction as is the case for self-propelling particles. To explain these dynamics, we provide detailed scaling and statistical analyses based on the activity-induced hydrodynamic interactions and the observed microstructural correlations, which display a weak local order. Overall, these results elucidate and highlight the different effects of particle activity on the collective dynamics and transport phenomena in active fluids.</description>

      <title>Geometric conservation in curved spacetime and entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current for the perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for non-dissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To make progress towards the development of a theory on the motion of inclusions in thin structured films and membranes, we here consider as an initial step a circular disk in a two-dimensional, uniaxially anisotropic fluid layer. We assume overdamped dynamics, incompressibility of the fluid, and global alignment of the axis of anisotropy. Motion within this layer is affected by additional linear friction with the environment, for instance, a supporting substrate. We investigate the induced flows in the fluid when the disk is translated parallel or perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy. Moreover, expressions for corresponding mobilities and resistance coefficients of the disk are derived. Our results are obtained within the framework of a perturbative expansion in the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the fluid. Good agreement is found for moderate anisotropy when compared to associated results from finite-element simulations. At pronounced anisotropy, the induced flow fields are still predicted qualitatively correctly by the perturbative theory, although quantitative deviations arise. We hope to stimulate with our investigations corresponding experimental analyses, for example, concerning fluid flows in anisotropic thin films on uniaxially rubbed supporting substrates.</description>

      <title>Crow instability of vortex lines in dipolar superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical inviscid fluids, parallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves may exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the mutual approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into smaller and smaller vortex loops. We study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid enjoying the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction through mean-field simulations of the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter. We observe that both the strength and direction of the dipole-dipole interaction play a crucial role in determining the Kelvin modes that are dynamically favoured. This is shown to be linked to effective enhancements or suppressions of the vortices' curvature and can be explained by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortex lines themselves. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnection dynamics, vortex loop cascading and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.</description>
