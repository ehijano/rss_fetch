      <title>The Sound of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, replacing the deterministic framework of classical physics with a paradigm dominated by intrinsic randomness and quantum correlations. This shift has not only enabled groundbreaking technologies, such as quantum sensors, networks and computers, but has also unlocked entirely new possibilities for artistic expressions. In this paper, we explore the intersection of quantum mechanics and art, focusing on the use of quantum entanglement and inherent randomness as creative tools. Specifically, we present The Sound of Entanglement, a live musical performance driven by real-time measurements of entangled photons in a Bell test. By integrating the measured quantum correlations as a central compositional element and synchronizing live visuals with experimental data, the performance offers a unique and unrepeatable audiovisual experience that relies on quantum correlations which cannot be produced by any classical device. Through this fusion of science and art, we aim to provide a deeper appreciation of quantum phenomena while expanding the boundaries of creative expression.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

      <title>MoLEx: Mixture of LoRA Experts in Speech Self-Supervised Models for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While self-supervised learning (SSL)-based models have boosted audio deepfake detection accuracy, fully finetuning them is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient framework that combines Low-Rank Adaptation with a Mixture-of-Experts router, called Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLEx). It preserves pre-trained knowledge of SSL models while efficiently finetuning only selected experts, reducing training costs while maintaining robust performance. The observed utility of experts during inference shows the router reactivates the same experts for similar attacks but switches to other experts for novel spoofs, confirming MoLEx's domain-aware adaptability. MoLEx additionally offers flexibility for domain adaptation by allowing extra experts to be trained without modifying the entire model. We mainly evaluate our approach on the ASVSpoof 5 dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) equal error rate (EER) of 5.56% on the evaluation set without augmentation.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Dental AI: A Multimodal Benchmark and Instruction Dataset for Panoramic X-ray Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model, benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/isbrycee/OralGPT.</description>

      <title>Can Multimodal LLMs See Materials Clearly? A Multimodal Benchmark on Materials Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information, revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising 1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MatCha.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer-Based Piano Transcription With Sparse Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates automatic piano transcription based on computationally-efficient yet high-performant variants of the Transformer that can capture longer-term dependency over the whole musical piece. Recently, transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated excellent performance in piano transcription. These models, however, fail to deal with the whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window manner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient architecture with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce sliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and decoder, and a hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans according to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy between the encoder and decoder to further reduce computational load. Our experiments on the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a significant reduction in computational cost and memory usage, accelerating inference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the full-attention baseline. This allows for training with longer audio contexts on the same hardware, demonstrating the viability of sparse attention for building efficient and high-performance piano transcription systems. The code is available at https://github.com/WX-Wei/efficient-seq2seq-piano-trans.</description>

      <title>In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF, all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework, termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second, we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.</description>
