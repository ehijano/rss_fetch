      <title>Cold-Diffusion Driven Downward Continuation of Gravity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity data can be better interpreted after enhancing high-frequency information via downward continuation. Downward continuation is an ill-posed deconvolution problem. It has been tackled using regularization techniques, which are sensitive to the choice of regularization parameters. More recently, convolutional neural networks such as the U-Net have been trained using synthetic data to potentially learn prior information and perform deconvolution without the need to adjust the regularization parameters. Our experiments reveal that the U-Net is highly sensitive to correlated noise, which is ubiquitously present in geophysical field data. In this paper, we develop a framework based on the $\textbf{cold-diffusion model}$ using the exponential kernel associated with downward continuation. The exponential form of the kernel allows us to train the U-Net to tackle multiple concurrent deconvolution problems with varying levels of blur. This allows our framework to be more robust and quantitatively outperform traditional U-Net-based approaches. The performances also closely matches that of $\textbf{oracle}$ Tikhonov reconstruction technique, which has access to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Space waste: An update of the anthropogenic matter injection into Earth atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large satellite constellations are one of the main reasons for an increasing amount of mass being brought into low Earth orbit in recent years. After end of life, the satellites, as well as rocket stages, reenter Earth's atmosphere. This space waste burns up and thus injects a substantial amount of its matter into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A first comprehensive analysis of the anthropogenic injection and a comparison to the natural injection by meteoroids was presented by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021). They found significant and even the dominant injection of several metal elements regularly used in spacecraft compared to the natural injection. The first observations of space waste remnants in stratospheric aerosol particles (Murphy et al., 2023) confirmed several of these estimates, but also revealed differences and new insights. The current study presents an update to the space waste injection estimates of Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021), assessing the years from 2015 to 2025 but also considering future mass influx scenarios. 43 elements are considered and thus a much more detailed comparison to the meteoric injection is possible. Comparison of estimated elemental fluxes to stratospheric aerosol data shows excellent agreement. From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24 elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity. This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of specific elements.</description>

      <title>Direct test for critical slowing down before Dansgaard-Oeschger events via the volcanic climate response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is tested whether past abrupt climate changes support the validity of statistical early-warning signals (EWS) as predictor of future climate tipping points. EWS are expected increases in amplitude and correlation of fluctuations driven by noise. This is a symptom of critical slowing down (CSD), where a system's recovery from an external perturbation becomes slower as a tipping point (represented by a bifurcation) is approached. EWS are a simple, indirect measure of CSD, but subject to assumptions on the noise process and measurement stationarity that are hard to verify. In this work the existence of CSD before the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial period is directly tested by inferring the climate's recovery from large volcanic eruptions. By averaging over hundreds of eruptions, a well-defined, stationary perturbation is constructed and the average climate response is measured by eight ice core proxies. As the abrupt DO warming transitions are approached, the climate response to eruptions remains the same, indicating no CSD. For the abrupt DO cooling transitions, however, some key proxies show evidence of larger climate response and slower recovery as the transitions are approached. By comparison, almost all proxies show statistical EWS before cooling and warming transitions, but with only weak confidence for the warming transitions. There is thus qualitative agreement of CSD and EWS, in that the evidence for bifurcation precursors is larger for the cooling transitions. However, the discrepancy that many proxies show EWS but no direct CSD (and vice versa) highlights that statistical EWS in individual observables need to be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>Differentiating frictionally locked asperities from kinematically coupled zones</title>

Abstract: Seismogenic areas on plate-boundary faults resist slipping until earthquakes begin. The delay in slip relative to plate motion, termed slip deficit, represents plate coupling as an interseismic proxy of seismic potential. However, when a part of a frictional interface sticks together (locked), the unlocked sliding surroundings are braked and slowed (coupled), causing coupled zones always wider than the locked zones that rupture during earthquakes. This study investigates the frictional physics that locked and unlocked zones should observe, laying the foundation for inferring frictionally locked segments, known as asperities in fault mechanics. Various friction laws are shown to have a unified representation of locking. (I) Locking means the pre-yield phase, where the fault interface does not slip, and unlocking means the post-yield phase, where stress on the interface equals strength. (II) For intersesismic periods, while locking still denotes constant slip, unlocking signifies quasi-steady creeping of constant stress. Locking inversion, a variant of conventional coupling inversion that incorporates this unified frictional physics, estimates the distribution of locking, determining slip and stress distributions consequently. We solve the locking inversion by a method that distributes circular asperities on unlocked interfaces. By applying this method to on-/off-shore GNSS data in southwestern Japan, we detect five primary locked segments along the Nankai subduction zone. Those segments accord with slip zones of historical megathrust earthquakes correlated with seafloor basins. Estimated locked zones avoid the occurrence zones of deep slow earthquakes, reproducing the hypothesis that the areas hosting slow earthquakes are normally, in interseismic timescales, coupled but unlocked.</description>
