      <title>Tracking the Mean of a Piecewise Stationary Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of tracking the mean of a piecewise stationary sequence of independent random variables. First we consider the case where the transition times are known and show that a direct running average performs the tracking in short time and with high accuracy. We then use a single valued weighted running average with a tunable parameter for the case when transition times are unknown and establish deviation bounds for the tracking accuracy. Our result has applications in choosing the optimal rewards for the multiarmed bandit scenario.</description>

      <title>Dirac-type Theorems for Inhomogenous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Dirac-type theorems for an inhomogenous random graph (G) whose edge probabilities are not necessarily all the same. We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of Hamiltonian paths and perfect matchings, in terms of the \emph{sum} of edge probabilities. For edge probability assignments with two-sided bounds, we use P\'osa rotation and single vertex exclusion techniques to show that (G) is Hamiltonian with high probability. For weaker one-sided bounds, we use bootstrapping techniques to obtain a perfect matching in (G,) with high probability. We also highlight an application of our results in the context of channel assignment problem in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Concentration and central limit theorem for the averaging process on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the averaging process on a graph $G = (V, E)$, a random mass distribution $\eta$ on $V$ is repeatedly updated via transformations of the form $\eta_{v}, \eta_{w} \mapsto (\eta_{v} + \eta_{w})/2$, with updates made according to independent Poisson clocks associated to the edge set $E$. We study the averaging process when $G$ is the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. We prove that the process has tight asymptotic concentration around its mean in the $\ell^{1}$ and $\ell^{2}$ norms and use this to prove a central limit theorem. Previous work by Nagahata and Yoshida implies the central limit theorem when $d \geq 3$. Our results extend this to hold for all $d \geq 1$, and our techniques are likely applicable to other processes for which previously only the $d \geq 3$ case was tractable.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the obstacle problem for stochastic nonlinear diffusion equations: an entropy formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence, uniqueness and stability results for the obstacle problem associated with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion equation perturbed by conservative gradient noise. Our approach revolves round introducing a new entropy formulation for stochastic variational inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain a novel well-posedness result for the obstacle problem of deterministic porous medium equations with nonlinear reaction terms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Riemannian metric for Poincar{\'e} inequalities and how to ideally precondition Langevin dymanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poincar{\'e} inequality is a fundamental property that rises naturally in different branches of mathematics. The associated Poincar{\'e} constant plays a central role in many applications, since it governs the convergence of various practical algorithms. For instance, the convergence rate of the Langevin dynamics is exactly given by the Poincar{\'e} constant. This paper investigates a Riemannian version of Poincar{\'e} inequality where a positive definite weighting matrix field (i.e. a Riemannian metric) is introduced to improve the Poincar{\'e} constant, and therefore the performances of the associated algorithm. Assuming the underlying measure is a \emph{moment measure}, we show that an optimal metric exists and the resulting Poincar{\'e} constant is 1. We demonstrate that such optimal metric is necessarily a \emph{Stein kernel}, offering a novel perspective on these complex but central mathematical objects that are hard to obtain in practice. We further discuss how to numerically obtain the optimal metric by deriving an implementable optimization algorithm. The resulting method is illustrated on a few simple but nontrivial examples, where solutions are revealed to be rather sophisticated. We also demonstrate how to design efficient Langevin-based sampling schemes by utilizing the precomputed optimal metric as a preconditioner.</description>

      <title>Condensation in zero-range processes with a fast rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple zero-range process with constant rates and one fast rate for a particular occupation number, which diverges with the system size. Surprisingly, this minor modification induces a condensation transition in the thermodynamic limit, where the structure of the condensed phase depends on the scaling of the fast rate. We study this transition and its dependence on system parameters in detail on a rigorous level using size-biased sampling. This approach generalizes to any particle system with stationary product measures, and the techniques used in this paper provide a foundation for a more systematic understanding of condensing models with a non-trivial condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Tight stability bounds for entropic Brenier maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic Brenier maps are regularized analogues of Brenier maps (optimal transport maps) which converge to Brenier maps as the regularization parameter shrinks. In this work, we prove quantitative stability bounds between entropic Brenier maps under variations of the target measure. In particular, when all measures have bounded support, we establish the optimal Lipschitz constant for the mapping from probability measures to entropic Brenier maps. This provides an exponential improvement to a result of Carlier, Chizat, and Laborde (2024). As an application, we prove near-optimal bounds for the stability of semi-discrete \emph{unregularized} Brenier maps for a family of discrete target measures.</description>

      <title>The metric removability of interfaces in the directed landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed landscape is a prominent model of random geometry which is believed to be the universal scaling limit of all planar random geometries in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. It comes equipped with a few different natural simple curves associated to it, such as geodesics and interfaces. Given such a curve, one might wonder whether the geometry off this curve determines the entire landscape, or if in fact, there is non-trivial extra information actually present "on" the curve. In this paper, we show that the former is true for an interface in the directed landscape, while the latter is true for a geodesic instead. Further, as is used in the proof of the first assertion above, we show that the set of times where any geodesic intersects an interface a.s. has dimension zero.</description>

      <title>Branching Brownian motion versus Random Energy Model in the supercritical phase: overlap distribution and temperature susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <title>Classification and Regression Error Bounds for Inhomogenous Data With Applications to Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study classification and regression error bounds for inhomogenous data that are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. First, we consider classification of data in the presence of non-stationary noise and establish ergodic type sufficient conditions that guarantee the achievability of the Bayes error bound, using universal rules. We then perform a similar analysis for $k$-nearest neighbour regression and obtain optimal error bounds for the same. Finally, we illustrate applications of our results in the context of wireless networks.</description>

      <title>The $2$-torsion of determinantal hypertrees is not Cohen-Lenstra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T_n$ be a $2$-dimensional determinantal hypertree on $n$ vertices. Kahle and Newman conjectured that the $p$-torsion of $H_1(T_n,\mathbb{Z})$ asymptotically follows the Cohen-Lenstra distribution. For $p=2$, we disprove this conjecture by showing that given a positive integer $h$, for all large enough $n$, we have \[\mathbb{P}(\dim H_1(T_n,\mathbb{F}_2)\ge h)\ge \frac{e^{-200h}}{(100h)^{5h}}.\] We also show that $T_n$ is a bad cosystolic expander with positive probability.</description>

      <title>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is extensive literature on approximation, deterministic as well as random, of general convex bodies $K$ in the symmetric difference metric, or other metrics arising from intrinsic volumes, very little is known for corresponding random results in the Hausdorff distance when the approximant $K_n$ is given by the convex hull of $n$ independent random points chosen uniformly on the boundary or in the interior of $K$. When $K$ is a polygon and the points are chosen on its boundary, we determine the exact limiting behavior of the expected Hausdorff distance between a polygon as $n\to\infty$. From this we derive the behavior of the asymptotic constant for a regular polygon in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence to the local time of Oscillating and Skew Brownian Motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of statistics based on high frequency observations of oscillating and skew Brownian motion is considered. Their convergence rate towards the local time of the underlying process is obtained in form of a functional limit theorem. Oscillating and skew Brownian motion are solutions to stochastic differential equations with singular coefficients: piecewise constant diffusion coefficient or additive local time finite variation term. The result is applied to provide estimators of the skewness parameter and study their asymptotic behavior, and diffusion coefficient estimation is discussed as well. Moreover, in the case of the classical statistics given by the normalized number of crossings, the result is proved to hold for a larger class of It\^o processes with singular coefficients. Up to our knowledge, this is the first result proving the convergence rates for estimators of the skewness parameter of skew Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Solving non-Markovian Stochastic Control Problems driven by Wiener Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.06981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a general methodology for stochastic control problems driven by the Brownian motion filtration including non-Markovian and non-semimartingale state processes controlled by mutually singular measures. The main result of this paper is the development of a numerical scheme for computing near-optimal controls associated with controlled Wiener functionals via a finite-dimensional approximation procedure. The approach does not require functional differentiability assumptions on the value process and ellipticity conditions on the diffusion components. The general convergence of the method is established under rather weak conditions for distinct types of non-Markovian and non-semimartingale states. Explicit rates of convergence are provided in case the control acts only on the drift component of the controlled system. Near-closed/open-loop optimal controls are fully characterized by a dynamic programming algorithm and they are classified according to the strength of the possibly underlying non-Markovian memory. The theory is applied to stochastic control problems based on path-dependent SDEs and rough stochastic volatility models, where both drift and possibly degenerated diffusion components are controlled. Optimal control of drifts for nonlinear path-dependent SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion with exponent $H\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$ is also discussed. Finally, we present a simple numerical example to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>Typical structure of sparse exponential random graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) where the sufficient statistics are functions of homomorphism counts for a fixed collection of simple graphs $F_k$. Whereas previous work has shown a degeneracy phenomenon in dense ERGMs, we show this can be cured by raising the sufficient statistics to a fractional power. We rigorously establish the na\"ive mean-field approximation for the partition function of the corresponding Gibbs measures, and in case of "ferromagnetic" models with vanishing edge density show that typical samples resemble a typical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph with a planted clique and/or a planted complete bipartite graph of appropriate sizes. We establish such behavior also for the conditional structure of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph in the large deviations regime for excess $F_k$-homomorphism counts. These structural results are obtained by combining quantitative large deviation principles, established in previous works, with a novel stability form of a result of [5] on the asymptotic solution for the associated entropic variational problem. A technical ingredient of independent interest is a stability form of Finner's generalized H\"older inequality.</description>

      <title>Existence of a tricritical point for the Blume-Capel model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a tricritical point for the Blume-Capel model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for every $d\geq 2$. The proof in $d\geq 3$ relies on a novel combinatorial mapping to an Ising model on a larger graph, the techniques of Aizenman, Duminil-Copin, and Sidoravicious (Comm. Math. Phys, 2015), and the celebrated infrared bound. In $d=2$, the proof relies on a quantitative analysis of crossing probabilities of the dilute random cluster representation of the Blume-Capel. In particular, we develop a quadrichotomy result in the spirit of Duminil-Copin and Tassion (Moscow Math. J., 2020), which allows us to obtain a fine picture of the phase diagram in $d=2$, including asymptotic behaviour of correlations in all regions. Finally, we show that the techniques used to establish subcritical sharpness for the dilute random cluster model extend to any $d\geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for Brownian Motion on Riemannian Manifolds with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove geometric upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion i.e. extended Wentzell-type boundary condition under general curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. The method is based on an interpolation involving energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold. As side results we obtain explicit geometric bounds on the first nontrivial Steklov eigenvalue, for the norm of the boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions, and on the boundary trace logarithmic Sobolev constant. The case of Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection is also treated.</description>

      <title>Multivariate CLT for critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a multivariate central limit theorem for the numbers of critical points above a level with all possible indexes of a non-necessarily isotropic Gaussian random field. In particular, we discuss the non-degeneracy of the limit variance-covariance matrix. We extend, to the non-isotropic framework, known results by Estrade \&amp; Le{\'o}n and Nicolaescu for the Euler characteristic of an excursion set and for the total number of critical points of Gaussian random fields. Furthermore, we deduce the almost sure convergence of the normalized (by its mean) number of critical points above a level with any given index and, in particular, of the Euler characteristic of an excursion set. Though we use the classical tools of Hermite expansions and Fourth Moment Theorem, our proof of the non-degeneracy of the limit variance-covariance matrix is completely new since we need to consider all chaotic terms.</description>

      <title>On the anti-concentration functions of some familiar families of distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{X_{\alpha}\}$ be a family of random variables following a certain type of distributions with finite expectation $\mathbf{E}[X_{\alpha}]$ and finite variance ${\rm Var}(X_{\alpha})$, where $\alpha$ is a parameter. Motivated by the recent paper of Hollom and Portier (arXiv: 2306.07811v1), we study the anti-concentration function $(0, \infty)\ni y\to \inf_{\alpha}\mathbf{P}\left(|X_{\alpha}-\mathbf{E}[X_{\alpha}]|\geq y \sqrt{{\rm Var}(X_{\alpha})}\right)$ and find its explicit expression. We show that, for certain familiar families of distributions, including uniform distributions, exponential distributions, non-degenerate Gaussian distributions and student's $t$-distribution, the anti-concentration function is not identically zero, while for some other familiar families of distributions, including binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, hypergeometric, Gamma, Pareto, Weibull, log-normal and Beta distributions, the anti-concentration function is identically zero.</description>

      <title>Long run convergence of discrete-time interacting particle systems of the McKean-Vlasov type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time system of n coupled random vectors, a.k.a. interacting particles.  The dynamics involve a vanishing step size, some random centered perturbations,  and a mean vector field which induces the coupling between the particles.  We study the doubly asymptotic regime where both the number of iterations and the number n of particles tend to infinity,  without any constraint on the relative rates of convergence of these two parameters.  We establish that the empirical measure of the interpolated trajectories of the particles converges in probability,  in an ergodic sense, to the set of recurrent Mc-Kean-Vlasov distributions.  A first application example is the granular media equation, where the particles are shown  to converge to a critical point of the Helmholtz energy.  A second  example  is the convergence of stochastic gradient descent   to the global minimizer of the risk, in a wide two-layer neural networks using random features.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interactive particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial within the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interactive particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Unique ergodicity of simple symmetric random walks on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix an irrational number $\alpha$ and a smooth, positive, real function $\mathfrak{p}$ on the circle. If current position is $x\in \mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ then in the next step jump to $x+\alpha$ with probability $\mathfrak{p}(x)$ or to $x-\alpha$ with probability $1-\mathfrak{p}(x)$. In 1999 Sinai has proven that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is asymmetric (in certain sense) or $\alpha$ is Diophantine then the Markov process possesses a unique stationary distribution. Next year Conze and Guivarc'h showed the uniqueness of stationary distribution for an arbitrary irrational angle $\alpha$. In this note we present a new proof of latter result.</description>
