      <title>The Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates, where both volatility and interest rates are driven by correlated Gaussian Volterra processes. This framework unifies various well-known Markovian and non-Markovian models while preserving analytical tractability for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. We derive explicit formulas for pricing zero-coupon bond and interest rate cap or floor, along with a semi-explicit expression for the characteristic function of the log-forward index using Fredholm resolvents and determinants. This allows for fast and efficient derivative pricing and calibration via Fourier methods. We calibrate our model to market data and observe that our framework is flexible enough to capture key empirical features, such as the humped-shaped term structure of ATM implied volatilities for cap options and the concave ATM implied volatility skew term structure (in log-log scale) of the S&amp;P 500 options. Finally, we establish connections between our characteristic function formula and expressions that depend on infinite-dimensional Riccati equations, thereby making the link with conventional linear-quadratic models.</description>

      <title>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About XVA Model Risk but Were Afraid to Ask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valuation adjustments, collectively named XVA, play an important role in modern derivatives pricing to take into account additional price components such as counterparty and funding risk premia. They are an exotic price component carrying a significant model risk and computational effort even for vanilla trades. We adopt an industry-standard realistic and complete XVA modelling framework, typically used by XVA trading desks, based on multi-curve time-dependent volatility G2++ stochastic dynamics calibrated on real market data, and a multi-step Monte Carlo simulation including both variation and initial margins. We apply this framework to the most common linear and non-linear interest rates derivatives, also comparing the MC results with XVA analytical formulas. Within this framework, we identify the most relevant model risk sources affecting the precision of XVA figures and we measure the corresponding computational effort. In particular, we show how to build a parsimonious and efficient MC time simulation grid able to capture the spikes arising in collateralized exposure during the margin period of risk. As a consequence, we also show how to tune accuracy vs performance, leading to sufficiently robust XVA figures in a reasonable time, a very important feature for practical applications. Furthermore, we provide a quantification of the XVA model risk stemming from the existence of a range of different parameterizations according to the EU prudent valuation regulation. Finally, this work also serves as an handbook containing step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a complete, realistic and robust modelling framework of collateralized exposure and XVA.</description>
