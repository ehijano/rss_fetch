      <title>Learning physical unknowns from hydrodynamic shock and material interface features in ICF capsule implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high energy density physics (HEDP) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF), predictive modeling is complicated by uncertainty in parameters that characterize various aspects of the modeled system, such as those characterizing material properties, equation of state (EOS), opacities, and initial conditions. Typically, however, these parameters are not directly observable. What is observed instead is a time sequence of radiographic projections using X-rays. In this work, we define a set of sparse hydrodynamic features derived from the outgoing shock profile and outer material edge, which can be obtained from radiographic measurements, to directly infer such parameters. Our machine learning (ML)-based methodology involves a pipeline of two architectures, a radiograph-to-features network (R2FNet) and a features-to-parameters network (F2PNet), that are trained independently and later combined to approximate a posterior distribution for the parameters from radiographs. We show that the estimated parameters can be used in a hydrodynamics code to obtain density fields and hydrodynamic shock and outer edge features that are consistent with the data. Finally, we demonstrate that features resulting from an unknown EOS model can be successfully mapped onto parameters of a chosen analytical EOS model, implying that network predictions are learning physics, with a degree of invariance to the underlying choice of EOS model.</description>

      <title>EdSr: A Novel End-to-End Approach for State-Space Sampling in Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been widely used in complex systems, but the time scale is limited due to the small timestep. Here, we propose a novel method, named Exploratory dynamics Sampling with recursion (EdSr), which is inspired by Langevin dynamics, Stochastic Differential Equation and Taylor expansion formula, can be used in MD simulation with flexible timestep. By setting up four groups of experiments including simple function, ideal physical model, all-atom simulation and coarse-grained simulation, we demonstrate that EdSr can dynamically and flexibly adjust the simulation timestep according to requirements during simulation period, and can work with larger timestep than the widely used velocity-Verlet integrator. Although this method can not perform perfectly at flexible timestep with all simulation systems, we believe that it will be a promising approach in the future.</description>

      <title>DeepF-fNet: a physics-informed neural network for vibration isolation optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural optimization is essential for designing safe, efficient, and durable components with minimal material usage. Traditional methods for vibration control often rely on active systems to mitigate unpredictable vibrations, which may lead to resonance and potential structural failure. However, these methods face significant challenges when addressing the nonlinear inverse eigenvalue problems required for optimizing structures subjected to a wide range of frequencies. As a result, no existing approach has effectively addressed the need for real-time vibration suppression within this context, particularly in high-performance environments such as automotive noise, vibration and harshness, where computational efficiency is crucial.
  This study introduces DeepF-fNet, a novel neural network framework designed to replace traditional active systems in vibration-based structural optimization. Leveraging DeepONets within the context of physics-informed neural networks, DeepF-fNet integrates both data and the governing physical laws. This enables rapid identification of optimal parameters to suppress critical vibrations at specific frequencies, offering a more efficient and real-time alternative to conventional methods.
  The proposed framework is validated through a case study involving a locally resonant metamaterial used to isolate structures from user-defined frequency ranges. The results demonstrate that DeepF-fNet outperforms traditional genetic algorithms in terms of computational speed while achieving comparable results, making it a promising tool for vibration-sensitive applications. By replacing active systems with machine learning techniques, DeepF-fNet paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective structural optimization in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decoding Neuronal Networks: A Reservoir Computing Approach for Predicting Connectivity and Functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03131v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of analyzing electrophysiological measurements in neuronal networks. Our computational model, based on the Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) architecture, deciphers spatio-temporal data obtained from electrophysiological measurements of neuronal cultures. By reconstructing the network structure on a macroscopic scale, we reveal the connectivity between neuronal units. Notably, our model outperforms common methods like Cross-Correlation and Transfer-Entropy in predicting the network's connectivity map. Furthermore, we experimentally validate its ability to forecast network responses to specific inputs, including localized optogenetic stimuli.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Scattering by nanoplasmonic mesoscale assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flexibility and versatility of nanoassembled plasmonic structures provide platforms for mesoscale tunable optical modulation. Our recently developed model for these nanoassembled plasmonic structures is composed of a dielectric spherical core surrounded by a concentric spherical shell containing a random distribution of AuNPs. This model provides a useful platform for studying the role of a controlled amount of disorder on scattering by a particle. In that context, we explore the angular distribution of scattered light for different sizes (5 - 20 nm) and filling fractions (0.1 - 0.3) of the AuNP in the coatings. The simulations reveal that the coating of AuNPs redistributes power in a way that suppresses angular side lobes, thereby guiding the scattered power preferentially in the forward direction. These results highlight that with the ability to tune both the spatial and the spectral aspects of the scattering profile, these coated structures may serve as a platform for a variety of applications, including passive cloaking, scattering enhancement, and high-resolution imaging.</description>

Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of neural networks with one hidden layer and a modified activation function for solving physical problems. A rectified sigmoid activation function has been proposed to solve physical problems described by the ODE with neural networks. Algorithms for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network and a neuron-by-neuron gradient-free fitting method have been presented for the neural network with this activation function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of neural networks with a rectified sigmoid function over neural networks with a sigmoid function in the accuracy of solving physical problems (harmonic oscillator, relativistic slingshot, and Lorentz system).</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</description>

      <title>Systematic Benchmarking of Macrosegregation: The Performance of a Modified Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new alloy solidification benchmark, called AFRODITE, with well-defined setups and state-of-the-art measurements has emerged, enabling a thorough assessment of MacroSegregation (MS) solvers, particularly in terms of their ability to predict different features of MS maps. In this research, we first develop an analytical solution for the alloy-solidification Stefan problem, which involves melt, solid, and mushy regions. This new analytical solution extends a previous solution (S. Cho and J. Sunderland, "Heat-conduction problems with melting or freezing", J. Heat Transfer, vol. 91, pp. 421-426, 1969) by incorporating a linear microsegregation law as a function of temperature in place of spatial coordinate. Then, we adopt this solution to verify an OpenFOAM MS solver in a limiting condition, where only heat diffusion is present. Subsequently, to capture the MS map of the Sn-3%Pb AFRODITE benchmark, the solver is incorporated using the standard Blake-Kozeny-Carman permeability law and one of its hybrid variants, slightly modified in this work to better align with physics by ensuring a continuous transition of characteristics from the slurry to the porous regions of the mush. It is demonstrated that the hybrid model predicts the main features of the MS map, including the channel segregates morphology and peak segregation degree due to the pile-up effect, in much finer agreement with the experimental observation. Careful analyses of the results reveal that these improved predictions stem from the hybrid model's more accurate estimation of the re-melting, melt flow advection parallel, and advection normal to the solidification front.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite element method offers attractive methods for the numerical solution of coupled field problems arising in sensors and actuator simulations of various physical domains, like electrodynamics, mechanics, and thermodynamics. With this application perspective and being open, accessible, and fast implementations are possible, openCFS was launched in 2020. It provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. In particular, the acoustic module is part of active development, including several key methods. These methods include the perfectly-matched layer technique, non-confirming interface formulations, Lagrangian basis function, Legendre basis functions, spectral element formulations, a nodal element type, edge-based element type (aeroacoustic post-processing), absorbing boundary conditions, frequency dependent-material for time-harmonic and time-dependent simulations. Time-dependent simulations, time-harmonic simulations, and eigenvalue simulations are supported. Several variants of acoustic equations are implemented, including the relevant source terms and wave operators for aeroacoustics. The package includes rotating domains and non-conforming interfaces for fan noise simulations. It also contains an API to the Python3 package pyCFS. This paper presents openCFS with a focus on the acoustic module.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a multi-circuit quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) algorithm that leverages parallel quantum computing to reduce quantum resource requirements. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient for these computations. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems are based on single quantum circuits and, in many cases, use lattice-based methods. Current quantum devices are adorned with sufficient noise to make large and deep circuits untenable. We introduce a multiple-circuit algorithm for a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) solve of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method, called QLBM-frugal, aims to create more practical quantum circuits and strategies for differential equation-based problems. The presented method is validated and demonstrated for 2D lid-driven cavity flow. The two-circuit algorithm shows a marked reduction in CNOT gates, which consume the majority of the runtime on quantum devices. Compared to the baseline QLBM technique, a two-circuit strategy shows increasingly large improvements in gate counts as the qubit size, or problem size, increases. For 64 lattice sites, the CNOT count was reduced by 35%, and the gate depth decreased by 16%. This strategy also enables concurrent circuit execution, further halving the seen gate depth.</description>

      <title>Automatic feature selection and weighting in molecular systems using Differentiable Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential in the analysis of molecular systems and many other fields, but several uncertainties remain: What is the optimal number of features for a simplified, interpretable model that retains essential information? How should features with different units be aligned, and how should their relative importance be weighted? Here, we introduce the Differentiable Information Imbalance (DII), an automated method to rank information content between sets of features. Using distances in a ground truth feature space, DII identifies a low-dimensional subset of features that best preserves these relationships. Each feature is scaled by a weight, which is optimized by minimizing the DII through gradient descent. This allows simultaneously performing unit alignment and relative importance scaling, while preserving interpretability. DII can also produce sparse solutions and determine the optimal size of the reduced feature space. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on two benchmark molecular problems: (1) identifying collective variables that describe conformations of a biomolecule, and (2) selecting features for training a machine-learning force field. These results show the potential of DII in addressing feature selection challenges and optimizing dimensionality in various applications. The method is available in the Python library DADApy.</description>

      <title>TAEN: A Model-Constrained Tikhonov Autoencoder Network for Forward and Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder model-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAE achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pseudo-Spectral Time-Domain Theory of Magnetic Neutron Scattering Illustrated Using A Uniformly Magnetized Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</description>
