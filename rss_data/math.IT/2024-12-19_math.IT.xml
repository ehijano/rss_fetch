      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Internet of Vehicles Over Error-Prone Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Age of Information (AoI) has become a vital performance metric for evaluating the freshness of information in communication systems. Although many studies aim to minimize the average AoI of the system through optimized resource scheduling schemes, they often fail to adequately consider the queue characteristics. Moreover, the vehicle mobility leads to rapid changes in network topology and channel conditions, making it difficult to accurately reflect the unique characteristics of vehicles with the calculated AoI under ideal channel conditions. This paper examines the impact of Doppler shifts caused by vehicle speeds on data transmission in error-prone channels. Based on the M/M/1 and D/M/1 queuing theory models, we derive expressions for the Age of Information and optimize the system's average AoI by adjusting the data extraction rates of vehicles (which affect system utilization). We propose an online optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the vehicles' data extraction rates based on environmental changes to ensure optimal AoI. Simulation results have demonstrated that adjusting the data extraction rates of vehicles can significantly reduce the system's AoI. Additionally, in the network scenario of this work, the AoI of the D/M/1 system is lower than that of the M/M/1 system.</description>

      <title>Low Time Complexity Near-Field Channel and Position Estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the application of high-frequency communication and extremely large MIMO (XL-MIMO), the near-field effect has become increasingly apparent. The near-field channel estimation and position estimation problems both rely on the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and the Curvature of Arrival (CoA) estimation. However, in the near-field channel model, the coupling of AoA and CoA information poses a challenge to the estimation of the near-field channel. This paper proposes a Joint Autocorrelation and Cross-correlation (JAC) scheme to decouple AoA and CoA estimation. Based on the JAC scheme, we propose two specific near-field estimation algorithms, namely Inverse Sinc Function (JAC-ISF) and Gradient Descent (JAC-GD) algorithms. Finally, we analyzed the time complexity of the JAC scheme and the cramer-rao lower bound (CRLB) for near-field position estimation. The simulation experiment results show that the algorithm designed based on JAC scheme can solve the problem of coupled CoA and AoA information in near-field estimation, thereby improving the algorithm performance. The JAC-GD algorithm shows significant performance in channel estimation and position estimation at different SNRs, snapshot points, and communication distances compared to other algorithms. This indicates that the JAC-GD algorithm can achieve more accurate channel and position estimation results while saving time overhead.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies one-generator and two-generator quasi-cyclic codes over finite fields. We present two versions of necessary and sufficient conditions for the symplectic selforthogonality of one-generator quasi-cyclic codes, using both matrix and polynomial approaches. We provide two versions of necessary and sufficient conditions for two-generator quasi-cyclic codes for symplectic self-orthogonality and the symplectic dual-containing condition. Additionally, using these necessary and sufficient conditions, we construct new quantum codes with record-breaking parameters that improve upon current records.</description>

      <title>Quantum Codes from Group Ring Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines group ring codes over finite fields and finite groups. We also present a section on two-dimensional cyclic codes in the quotient ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x, y] / \langle x^{l} - 1, y^{m} - 1 \rangle$. These two-dimensional cyclic codes can be analyzed using the group ring $\mathbb{F}_q(C_{l} \times C_{m})$, where $C_{l}$ and $C_{m}$ represent cyclic groups of orders $l$ and $m$, respectively. The aim is to show that studying group ring codes provides a more compact approach compared to the quotient ring method. We further extend this group ring framework to study codes over other group structures, such as the dihedral group, direct products of cyclic and dihedral groups, direct products of two cyclic groups, and semidirect products of two groups. Additionally, we explore necessary and sufficient conditions for such group ring codes to be self-orthogonal under Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products and propose a construction for quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based secure transmission framework is proposed to enhance physical layer security. Continuous current distributions, or beamformers, are designed to maximize the secrecy transmission rate under a power constraint and to minimize the required transmission power for achieving a specific target secrecy rate. On this basis, the fundamental secrecy performance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form expressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power (MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide further insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which reveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to maximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the optimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR regime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures, e.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and power scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous beamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both achievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior secrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs.</description>

      <title>Minimum Data Rate Maximization for Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization of multi-user pinching-antenna systems, recently developed for next-generation wireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of pinching antennas to dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum achievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between throughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately optimizes the positions of the pinching antennas and the resource allocation. The antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a closed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the significant potential of pinching-antenna systems for robust and efficient uplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Turbo product decoding of cubic tensor codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long, powerful soft detection forward error correction codes are typically constructed by concatenation of shorter component codes that are decoded through iterative Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) procedures. The current gold-standard is Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, which are built from weak single parity check component codes that are capable of producing accurate SO. Due to the recent development of SISO decoders that produce highly accurate SO with codes that have multiple redundant bits, square product code constructions that can avail of more powerful component codes have been shown to be competitive with the LDPC codes in the 5G New Radio standard in terms of decoding performance while requiring fewer iterations to converge. Motivated by applications that require more powerful low-rate codes, in the present paper we explore the possibility of extending this design space by considering the construction and decoding of cubic tensor codes.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Generative Clustering of Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present {\em generative clustering} (GC) for clustering a set of documents, $\mathrm{X}$, by using texts $\mathrm{Y}$ generated by large language models (LLMs) instead of by clustering the original documents $\mathrm{X}$. Because LLMs provide probability distributions, the similarity between two documents can be rigorously defined in an information-theoretic manner by the KL divergence. We also propose a natural, novel clustering algorithm by using importance sampling. We show that GC achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming any previous clustering method often by a large margin. Furthermore, we show an application to generative document retrieval in which documents are indexed via hierarchical clustering and our method improves the retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Whitney numbers of the first kind of rank-metric lattices, which are closely linked to the open problem of enumerating rank-metric codes having prescribed parameters. We apply methods from the theory of hyperovals and linear sets to compute these Whitney numbers for infinite families of rank-metric lattices. As an application of our results, we prove asymptotic estimates on the density function of certain rank-metric codes that have been conjectured in previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the theory of defining sets, two classes of at most six-weight linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_p$ are constructed. The weight distributions of the linear codes are determined by means of Gaussian period and Weil sums. In some case, there is an almost optimal code with respect to Griesmer bound, which is also an optimal one according to the online code table. The linear codes can also be employed to get secret sharing schemes.</description>

      <title>Soft-output (SO) GRAND and Iterative Decoding to Outperform LDPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10737v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that a large, flexible class of long, high redundancy error correcting codes can be efficiently and accurately decoded with guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND). Performance evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to construct simple product codes with lengths of approximately 200 to 4000 bits and rates between 0.2 and 0.8 that outperform low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from the 5G New Radio standard in both AWGN and fading channels. The concatenated structure enables many desirable features, including: low-complexity hardware-friendly encoding and decoding; significant flexibility in length and rate through modularity; and high levels of parallelism in encoding and decoding that enable low latency.
  Central is the development of a method through which any soft-input (SI) GRAND algorithm can provide soft-output (SO) in the form of an accurate a-posteriori estimate of the likelihood that a decoding is correct or, in the case of list decoding, the likelihood that each element of the list is correct. The distinguishing feature of soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND) is the provision of an estimate that the correct decoding has not been found, even when providing a single decoding. That per-block SO can be converted into accurate per-bit SO by a weighted sum that includes a term for the SI. Implementing SOGRAND adds negligible computation and memory to the existing decoding process, and using it results in a practical, low-latency alternative to LDPC codes.</description>

Abstract: A matrix $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{Q \times N}$ satisfies the restricted isometry property if $\|\Phi x\|_2^2$ is approximately equal to $\|x\|_2^2$ for all $k$-sparse vectors $x$. We give a construction of RIP matrices with the optimal $Q = O(k \log(N/k))$ rows using $O(k\log(N/k)\log(k))$ bits of randomness. The main technical ingredient is an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to $\epsilon$-biased distributions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we take an information-theoretic approach to understand the robustness in wireless distributed learning. Upon measuring the difference in loss functions, we provide an upper bound of the performance deterioration due to imperfect wireless channels. Moreover, we characterize the transmission rate under task performance guarantees and propose the channel capacity gain resulting from the inherent robustness in wireless distributed learning. An efficient algorithm for approximating the derived upper bound is established for practical use. The effectiveness of our results is illustrated by the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Capacity Approximations for Insertion Channels with Small Insertion Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channels with synchronization errors, exhibiting deletion and insertion errors, find practical applications in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and various other domains. Presence of insertions and deletions render the channel with memory, complicating capacity analysis. For instance, despite the formulation of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel more than fifty years ago, and proof that the channel is information stable, hence its Shannon capacity exists, calculation of the capacity remained elusive. However, a relatively recent result establishes the capacity of the deletion channel in the asymptotic regime of small deletion probabilities by computing the dominant terms of the capacity expansion. This paper extends that result to binary insertion channels, determining the dominant terms of the channel capacity for small insertion probabilities and establishing capacity in this asymptotic regime. Specifically, we consider two i.i.d. insertion channel models: insertion channel with possible random bit insertions after every transmitted bit and the Gallager insertion model, for which a bit is replaced by two random bits with a certain probability. To prove our results, we build on methods used for the deletion channel, employing Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for achievability and coupling this with a converse using stationary and ergodic processes as inputs, and show that the channel capacity differs only in the higher order terms from the achievable rates with i.i.d. inputs. The results, for instance, show that the capacity of the random insertion channel is higher than that of the Gallager insertion channel, and quantifies the difference in the asymptotic regime.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>
