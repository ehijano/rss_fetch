      <title>Matching Cut and Variants on Bipartite Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Matching Cut problem we ask whether a graph $G$ has a matching cut, that is, a matching which is also an edge cut of $G$. We consider the variants Perfect Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching where we ask whether there exists a matching cut equal to, respectively contained in, a perfect matching. Further, in the problem Maximum Matching Cut we ask for a matching cut with a maximum number of edges. The last problem we consider is $d$-Cut where we ask for an edge cut where each vertex is incident to at most $d$ edges in the cut.
  We investigate the computational complexity of these problems on bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter. Our results extend known results for Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching. We give complexity dichotomies for $d$-Cut and Maximum Matching Cut and solve one of two open cases for Disconnected Perfect Matching. For Perfect Matching Cut we give the first hardness result for bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter and extend the known polynomial cases.</description>

      <title>Computing Game Symmetries and Equilibria That Respect Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic interactions can be represented more concisely, and analyzed and solved more efficiently, if we are aware of the symmetries within the multiagent system. Symmetries also have conceptual implications, for example for equilibrium selection. We study the computational complexity of identifying and using symmetries. Using the classical framework of normal-form games, we consider game symmetries that can be across some or all players and/or actions. We find a strong connection between game symmetries and graph automorphisms, yielding graph automorphism and graph isomorphism completeness results for characterizing the symmetries present in a game. On the other hand, we also show that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable when we restrict the consideration of actions in one of two ways.
  Next, we investigate when exactly game symmetries can be successfully leveraged for Nash equilibrium computation. We show that finding a Nash equilibrium that respects a given set of symmetries is PPAD- and CLS-complete in general-sum and team games respectively -- that is, exactly as hard as Brouwer fixed point and gradient descent problems. Finally, we present polynomial-time methods for the special cases where we are aware of a vast number of symmetries, or where the game is two-player zero-sum and we do not even know the symmetries.</description>

      <title>Direct sum theorems beyond query complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in computer science is: Is it harder to solve $n$ instances independently than to solve them simultaneously? This question, known as the direct sum question or direct sum theorem, has been paid much attention in several research fields. Despite its importance, however, little has been discovered in many other research fields.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that extends to classical/quantum query complexity, PAC-learning for machine learning, statistical estimation theory, and more. Within this framework, we establish several fundamental direct sum theorems. The main contributions of this paper include: (i) establishing a complete characterization of the amortized query/oracle complexities, and (ii) proving tight direct sum theorems when the error is small. Note that in our framework, every oracle access needs to be performed \emph{classically} even in the quantum setting. This can be thought of one limitation of this work.
  As a direct consequence of our results, we obtain the following: (A) The first known asymptotic separation of the randomized query complexity. Specifically, we show that there is a function $f: \{0, 1\}^k \to \{0, 1\}$ and small error $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that solving $n$ instances simultaneously requires the query complexity $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{k})$ but solving one instance with the same error has the complexity $\tilde{\Omega}(k)$. In communication complexity this type of separation was previously given in~Feder, Kushilevitz, Naor and Nisan (1995). (B) The query complexity counterpart of the ``information = amortized communication" relation, one of the most influential results in communication complexity shown by Braverman and Rao (2011) and further investigated by Braverman (2015).
  We hope that our results will provide further interesting applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with Rank $|V(G)|/3$ for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt\'{a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>
