      <title>Optimal Rebalancing in Dynamic AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic AMM pools, as found in Temporal Function Market Making, rebalance their holdings to a new desired ratio (e.g. moving from being 50-50 between two assets to being 90-10 in favour of one of them) by introducing an arbitrage opportunity that disappears when their holdings are in line with their target. Structuring this arbitrage opportunity reduces to the problem of choosing the sequence of portfolio weights the pool exposes to the market via its trading function. Linear interpolation from start weights to end weights has been used to reduce the cost paid by pools to arbitrageurs to rebalance. Here we obtain the $\textit{optimal}$ interpolation in the limit of small weight changes (which has the downside of requiring a call to a transcendental function) and then obtain a cheap-to-compute approximation to that optimal approach that gives almost the same performance improvement. We then demonstrate this method on a range of market backtests, including simulating pool performance when trading fees are present, finding that the new approximately-optimal method of changing weights gives robust increases in pool performance. For a BTC-ETH-DAI pool from July 2022 to June 2023, the increases of pool P\&amp;L from approximately-optimal weight changes is $\sim25\%$ for a range of different strategies and trading fees.</description>

      <title>Growth rate of liquidity provider's wealth in G3Ms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric mean market makers (G3Ms), such as Uniswap and Balancer, represent a widely used class of automated market makers (AMMs). These G3Ms are characterized by the following rule: the reserves of the AMM must maintain the same (weighted) geometric mean before and after each trade. This paper investigates the effects of trading fees on liquidity providers' (LP) profitability in a G3M, as well as the adverse selection faced by LPs due to arbitrage activities involving a reference market. Our work expands the model described in previous studies for G3Ms, integrating transaction fees and continuous-time arbitrage into the analysis. Within this context, we analyze G3M dynamics, characterized by stochastic storage processes, and calculate the growth rate of LP wealth. In particular, our results align with and extend the results concerning the constant product market maker, commonly referred to as Uniswap v2.</description>

      <title>Deep Limit Order Book Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to explore the predictability of high-frequency Limit Order Book mid-price changes for a heterogeneous set of stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange. In so doing, we release `LOBFrame', an open-source code base to efficiently process large-scale Limit Order Book data and quantitatively assess state-of-the-art deep learning models' forecasting capabilities. Our results are twofold. We demonstrate that the stocks' microstructural characteristics influence the efficacy of deep learning methods and that their high forecasting power does not necessarily correspond to actionable trading signals. We argue that traditional machine learning metrics fail to adequately assess the quality of forecasts in the Limit Order Book context. As an alternative, we propose an innovative operational framework that evaluates predictions' practicality by focusing on the probability of accurately forecasting complete transactions. This work offers academics and practitioners an avenue to make informed and robust decisions on the application of deep learning techniques, their scope and limitations, effectively exploiting emergent statistical properties of the Limit Order Book.</description>
