      <title>Repairing the algebraic foundations of the Standard Model of particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is in such good agreement with experiment that it is still accepted as providing an accurate model of reality. Nevertheless, its algebraic foundations are in need of repair. Chirality is shown to be algebraically inconsistent with neutrinos having finite mass and being fermions. The SM description of parity is shown to be inconsistent, leading to erroneous interpretations of experiments, notably parity non-conservation. It is shown that a correct description of the intrinsic parity of fermions can only be obtained by extending the $Cl_{1,3}$ Dirac algebra at least to $Cl_{2,3}$. The $Cl_{3,3}$ algebra is shown to provide a description of parity that is always conserved and establishes a relation between spin direction and parity in the weak interaction, identifying the $\sigma$ matrices of the weak potential with its elements.</description>

      <title>Taking quantisation seriously: a farewell to waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual wave-particle nature of quantum objects is a notoriously unintuitive feature of quantum theories. However, it is often deemed essential, due to quantum objects exhibiting diffraction and interference. We extend the work of Land\'{e} and L\'{e}vy-Leblond to demonstrate that de Broglie wavelengths are not relativistically covariant as simultaneous spatial structures, making wave properties an unviable explanation of apparent interference. We then explore whether modern experiments vindicate an alternative view: that apparent waviness in diffraction and interference scenarios emerges as a consequence of quantised interactions between particles. Such a view has historically received very little attention, despite being the exact modern explanation of both the Kapitza-Dirac effect and ultrafast electron diffraction. We then study a photon orbital angular momentum realisation of the double slit to show that quantised exchanges can mimic interference. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum formalism demands that particle momentum is determined at the point of scattering, contravening wave-based explanations of quantum interference.</description>

      <title>Top Quark Bound States in Finite and Holomorphic Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the recently reported threshold enhancement in top-antitop production at the LHC in a finite, nonlocal, holomorphic quantum field theory framework. Our results demonstrate that the observed threshold excess can be consistently accommodated by a data-driven $\Lambda_{\mathrm{ker}}$ and small RG effects, while keeping global QCD tests intact. We quantify and contrast the key properties of the three heavyquark systems charmonium and bottomonium, highlighting the unique role of the top quark's decay width in shaping the phenomenology of toponium. Toponium emerges as a powerful laboratory for both infrared boundstate dynamics and ultraviolet completion effects, opening new avenues for precision tests of QCD.</description>

      <title>Supersonic and Superluminal Energy and Speed of Information via Temporal Interference in a Dispersionless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical implementation of a theory yields acoustic wave packets whose peak-to-peak speeds, $c_{3d}$, are supersonic in a dispersionless medium due to temporal interference between direct and boundary-reflected paths. The effect occurs when the source and receiver are near each other and at least one is within $c\tilde{\delta t}/2$ of the boundary, where $c$ is the phase speed of propagation in the medium, and $\tilde{\delta t}$ is the smallest temporal separation between the paths at which interference first occurs. This direct+reflected path effect is distinct from previously-observed superluminal phenomena and theories including quantum tunneling, cavity vacuum fluctuations, and group speeds due to anomalous dispersion. For temporally interfering direct+reflected paths, simulations yield a speed of information less than $c$. The speed of information from the interfering paths can exceed the speed derived from propagation only along the direct path. We conjecture these results will also hold for electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation. If so, we prove the speed of information is less than or equal to the speed of light in a vacuum, so the effect does not violate special relativity. These theoretical and simulation results, as well as their conjectured EM extension, should be readily accessible to experimental verification.</description>
