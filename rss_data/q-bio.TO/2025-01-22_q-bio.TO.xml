      <title>Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells alleviate neuropathic pain in mice by secreting TGF-b and IL-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition characterized by damage to and dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system. There are currently no effective treatment options available for neuropathic pain, and existing drugs often provide only temporary relief with potential side effects. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are characterized by high expansion potential, a stable phenotype and strong immunosuppression. These properties make them attractive candidates for therapeutics for neuropathic pain management. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effect of Muse cells on neuropathic pain. Muse cells from different species demonstrated analgesic potential by reversing CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Protein profiling revealed a high degree of similarity between Muse cells and BMSCs. The intrathecal injection of Muse cells effectively reduced neuropathic pain in various mouse models, resulting in better analgesic effects than the administration of equivalent low doses of BMSCs. Immunohistochemical analysis and qPCR revealed the ability of Muse cells to inhibit spinal cord neuroinflammation caused by SNI. In addition, Transwell and ELISA revealed that Muse cells migrated through the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) via the CCR7-CCL21 chemotactic axis. In addition, the secretion of TGF-b and IL-10 by Muse cells was identified as the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of Muse cells. The capacity of Muse cells to mitigate neuroinflammation and produce analgesic effects via the modulation of TGF-b and IL-10 underscores their potential as promising therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Lung Metastasis from Hepatocellular Carcinoma using the SEER Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with lung metastases being the most common site of distant spread and significantly worsening prognosis. Despite the growing availability of clinical and demographic data, predictive models for lung metastasis in HCC remain limited in scope and clinical applicability. In this study, we develop and validate an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We evaluated three machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression) alongside a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Our models achieved high AUROC values and recall, with the Random Forest and MLP models demonstrating the best overall performance (AUROC = 0.82). However, the low precision across models highlights the challenges of accurately predicting positive cases. To address these limitations, we developed a custom loss function incorporating recall optimization, enabling the MLP model to achieve the highest sensitivity. An ensemble approach further improved overall recall by leveraging the strengths of individual models. Feature importance analysis revealed key predictors such as surgery status, tumor staging, and follow up duration, emphasizing the relevance of clinical interventions and disease progression in metastasis prediction. While this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning for identifying high-risk patients, limitations include reliance on imbalanced datasets, incomplete feature annotations, and the low precision of predictions. Future work should leverage the expanding SEER dataset, improve data imputation techniques, and explore advanced pre-trained models to enhance predictive accuracy and clinical utility.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Study of Bone Growth Around Additively Manufactured Implants with Ti-6Al-4V and Bioactive Glass Powder Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Osseointegration is crucial to the success of biomedical implants. Additive manufacturing of implants offers a high degree of design freedom, enabling precise control over implant geometry and material composition. Bioactive glass (BG) can substantially enhance bone binding and bioactivity; however, limited research has been conducted on its incorporation into additively manufactured implants. The performance of BG varies depending on the incorporation method, and the spatial and temporal evolution of its integration remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized Ti-6Al-4V/58S BG composites by using the selective laser melting method and systematically compared the effects of BG coating and doping in additively manufactured implants. In vivo histological results from animal tests were statistically analyzed and discussed in terms of osseointegration over 4- and 12-week periods. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone density (BD) were used as quantitative metrics to evaluate interactions between the implants and surrounding bone. Our findings indicate that both BG-doped and BG-coated implants accelerated bone ingrowth during the early stages of healing. BG-coated implants demonstrated a greater improvement than did pure 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implants. However, the effects of BG became nonsignificant during the later healing stage (12 weeks). This study provides a foundation for systematically investigating BG incorporation methods in 3D-printed biomedical implants and their effect on osseointegration.</description>

      <title>Incorporating stochastic gene expression, signaling-mediated intercellular interactions, and regulated cell proliferation in models of coordinated tissue development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulating quantitative and predictive models for tissue development requires consideration of the complex, stochastic gene expression dynamics, its regulation via cell-to-cell interactions, and cell proliferation. Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.</description>

      <title>Cinepro: Robust Training of Foundation Models for Cancer Detection in Prostate Ultrasound Cineloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) detection using deep learning (DL) models has shown potential for enhancing real-time guidance during biopsies. However, prostate ultrasound images lack pixel-level cancer annotations, introducing label noise. Current approaches often focus on limited regions of interest (ROIs), disregarding anatomical context necessary for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models can overcome this limitation by analyzing entire images to capture global spatial relationships; however, they still encounter challenges stemming from the weak labels associated with coarse pathology annotations in ultrasound data. We introduce Cinepro, a novel framework that strengthens foundation models' ability to localize PCa in ultrasound cineloops. Cinepro adapts robust training by integrating the proportion of cancer tissue reported by pathology in a biopsy core into its loss function to address label noise, providing a more nuanced supervision. Additionally, it leverages temporal data across multiple frames to apply robust augmentations, enhancing the model's ability to learn stable cancer-related features. Cinepro demonstrates superior performance on a multi-center prostate ultrasound dataset, achieving an AUROC of 77.1% and a balanced accuracy of 83.8%, surpassing current benchmarks. These findings underscore Cinepro's promise in advancing foundation models for weakly labeled ultrasound data.</description>

      <title>Deciphering circulating tumor cells binding in a microfluidic system thanks to a parameterized mathematical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of metastases is a crucial process in which some questions remain unanswered. In this work, we focus on tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream, the so-called Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). Our aim is to characterize their trajectories under the influence of hemodynamic and adhesion forces. We focus on already available in vitro measurements performed with a microfluidic device corresponding to the trajectories of CTCs -- without or with different protein depletions -- interacting with an endothelial layer. A key difficulty is the weak knowledge of the fluid velocity that has to be reconstructed. Our strategy combines a differential equation model -- a Poiseuille model for the fluid velocity and an ODE system for the cell adhesion model -- and a robust and well-designed calibration procedure. The parameterized model quantifies the strong influence of fluid velocity on adhesion and confirms the expected role of several proteins in the deceleration of CTCs. Finally, it enables the generation of synthetic cells, even for unobserved experimental conditions, opening the way to a digital twin for flowing cells with adhesion.</description>
