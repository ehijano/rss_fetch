      <title>Diophantine Analysis of a Digital Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arithmetic-digital anomaly of $5\div 2 = 2.5$ has been observed several times in the past. We generalize it to an exponential Diophantine equation and inequality in the general number base, which is the object of our analysis. First, we produce a near-parametrization of all solutions using a modification of the standard parametrization of Pythagorean triples. We use this parametrized function to find all solutions where the numerator and denominator are coprime, and we construct infinite families where they are not coprime. Next, we use a variant of Baker's theorem from transcendental number theory to prove that each number base admits only finitely many solutions. Lastly, we use the $abc$ conjecture to conditionally show that only finitely many solutions have a numerator with $k$ digits, for each $k\ge 3$. A conjecture is offered for $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Polymorphic Numbers with Exponential Prefix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that the computation $5^2 = 25$ has the digital property of the result being equal to the exponent concatenated directly to the left of the base. The generalization to a Diophantine equation and inequality in number bases has been articulated previously, but a comprehensive answer was not available in the literature. We classify and largely parametrize the solutions. Tools that play key roles are the Newton-Raphson method, the arithmetic-geometric means inequality, Pell's equation, and Fermat's little theorem.</description>

      <title>A result from the thesis of the french astronomer Alexandre V\'eronnet: critical latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in a result found in the thesis of the astronomer Alexandre V\'eronnet (1876-1951) : "Precession of a fluid ring rotating along a parallel axis. Zone of maximum crustal compression at 35$^\circ$. A cause of earthquakes". In 1912, Alexandre V\'eronnet hypothesizes that the Earth's rotation influences the occurrence of earthquakes in the 35th parallel zone. Has this hypothesis been taken up by other authors, geophysicists, seismologists, etc.? Has it been confirmed or refuted? What is the literature on this subject? Our aim is not to draw a conclusion on this hypothesis but to examine the dissemination of a scientific result.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Ishango Bone: Unveiling Prehistoric Mathematical Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ishango Bone, a prehistoric artifact dated to approximately 20,000 years ago and discovered near the Semliki River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, has intrigued researchers for the past 75 years. The artifact displays sixteen groups of notches arranged in three columns. While its function remains debated, this study suggests that the first two columns consist exclusively of all prime or odd numbers between 9 and 21, with the exception of 15, which appears only in the third column as two grouped pairs. Five groupings totaling 30 could be identified, and their arrangement may follow a consistent pattern. Additional numerical relationships between all three columns can be interpreted to support all four basic arithmetic operations. It is hypothesized that the notches may have served as reference marker to lay out their values for storytelling or teaching in the form of mathematical art. This study aims to broaden perspectives on the Ishango Bone and its traditional interpretation as a simple tallying device, and to encourage a re-evaluation of the mathematical capabilities of prehistoric humans.</description>
