      <title>Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.</description>

      <title>Deep learning selection of analogues for Mars landing sites in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing observations and Mars rover missions have recorded the presence of beaches, salt lakes, and wind erosion landforms in Martian sediments. All these observations indicate that Mars was hydrated in its early history. There used to be oceans on Mars, but they have now dried up. Therefore, signs of previous life on Mars could be preserved in the evaporites formed during this process. The study of evaporite regions has thus become a priority area for Mars' life exploration. This study proposes a method for training similarity metrics from surface land image data of Earth and Mars, which can be used for recognition or validation applications. The method will be applied in simulating tasks to select Mars landing sites using a selecting small-scale area of the Mars analaogue the evaporite region of Qaidam Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This learning process minimizes discriminative loss function, which makes the similarity measure smaller for images from the same location and larger for images from different locations. This study selected a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model, which has been trained to explain various changes in image appearance and identify different landforms in Mars. By identifying different landforms, priority landing sites on Mars can be selected.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>
