      <title>The European Low Frequency Survey on the Simons Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the European Low Frequency Survey (ELFS), a project that will enable foregrounds-free measurements of the primordial $B$-mode polarization and a detection of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, to a level $\sigma(r) = 0.001$ by measuring the Galactic and extra-galactic emissions in the 5--120\,GHz frequency window. Indeed, the main difficulty in measuring the B-mode polarization comes from the fact that many other processes in the Universe also emit polarized microwaves, which obscure the faint Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. The first stage of this project is being carried out in synergy with the Simons Array (SA) collaboration, installing a 5.5--11\,GHz (X-band) coherent receiver at the focus of one of the three 3.5\,m SA telescopes in Atacama, Chile, followed by the installation of the QUIJOTE-MFI2 in the 10--20 GHz range. We designate this initial iteration of the ELFS program as ELFS-SA. The receivers are equipped with a fully digital back-end that will provide a frequency resolution of 1\,MHz across the band, allowing us to clean the scientific signal from unwanted radio frequency interference, particularly from low-Earth orbit satellite mega constellations. This paper reviews the scientific motivation for ELFS and its instrumental characteristics, and provides an update on the development of ELFS-SA.</description>

      <title>The Focal-plane Actualized Shifted Technique Realized for a Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (fastrSHWFS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical adaptive optics (AO) is a critical approach to enable ground-based diffraction-limited imaging and high contrast science, with the potential to enable habitable exoplanet imaging on future extremely large telescopes. However, AO systems must improve significantly to enable habitable exoplanet imaging. Time lag between the end of an exposure and end of deformable mirror commands being applied in an AO loop is now the dominant error term in many extreme AO systems (e.g., Poyneer et al. 2016), and within that lag component detector read time is becoming non-negligible (e.g., Cetre et al. 2018). This term will decrease as faster detector readout capabilities are developed by vendors. In complement, we have developed a modified Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SHWFS) to address this problem called the Focal-plane Actualized Shifted Technique Realized for a SHWFS (fastrSHWFS). The novelty of this design is to replace the usual lenslet array with a bespoke pupil-plane phase mask that redistributes the spot pattern on the detector into a rectangular array with a custom aspect ratio (in an extreme case, if the detector size can accommodate it, the array can be a single line). We present the fastrSHWFS concept and preliminary laboratory tests. For some detectors and AO systems, the fastrSHWFS technique can decrease the read time per frame compared to a regular SHWFS by up to 30x, supporting the goal of reduced AO lag needed to eventually enable habitable exoplanet imaging.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments: Decision Trees versus Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of Dark Matter (DM) remains a significant challenge in particle physics. This study exploits advanced machine learning models to improve detection capabilities of liquid xenon time projection chamber experiments, utilizing state-of-the-art transformers alongside traditional methods like Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate various data representations and find that simplified feature representations, particularly corrected S1 and S2 signals, retain critical information for classification. Our results show that while transformers offer promising performance, simpler models like XGBoost can achieve comparable results with optimal data representations. We also derive exclusion limits in the cross-section versus DM mass parameter space, showing minimal differences between XGBoost and the best performing deep learning models. The comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches provides a valuable reference for future experiments by guiding the choice of models and data representations to maximize detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Preliminary Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the basic design of a large, light weight, spaceborne antenna for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (space-VLBI) mission, achieving high efficiency operation at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. An introductory overview of the mission and its science background are provided. The BHEX mission targets fundamental black hole physics enabled by the detection of the finely structured image feature around black holes known as the photon ring, theoretically expected due to light orbiting the black hole before reaching the observer. Interferometer baselines much longer than an earth diameter are necessary to attain the spatial resolution required to detect the photon ring, leading to a space component. The science goals require high sensitivity observations at mm/sub-mm wavelengths, placing stringent constraints on antenna performance. The design approach described, seeks to balance the antenna aperture, volume and mass constraints of the NASA Explorers mission opportunity profile and the desired high performance. A 3.5 m aperture with a 40 $\mu$m surface rms is targeted. Currently, a symmetric, dual reflector, axially displaced ellipse (Gregorian ring focus) optical design and metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction have been chosen to deliver high efficiency and light weight. Further exploration of design choices and parameter space and reflector shaping studies are in progress</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Halo Mass Based Statistics For Fast Approximate N-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate N-body methods, such as FastPM and COLA, have been successful in modelling halo and galaxy clustering statistics, but their low resolution on small scales is a limitation for applications that require high precision. Full N-body simulations can provide better accuracy but are too computationally expensive for a quick exploration of cosmological parameters. This paper presents a method for correcting distinct haloes identified in fast N-body simulations, so that various halo statistics improve to a percent level accuracy. The scheme seeks to find empirical corrections to halo properties such that the virial mass is the same as that of a corresponding halo in a full N-body simulation. The modified outer density contour of the corrected halo is determined on the basis of the FastPM settings and the number of particles inside the halo. This method only changes some parameters of the halo finder, and does not require any extra CPU-cost. We demonstrate that the adjusted halo catalogues of FastPM simulations significantly improve the precision of halo mass-based statistics from redshifts $z=0.0$ to $1.0$, and that our calibration can be applied to different cosmologies without needing to be recalibrated.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Spectroscopy with Skipper CCDs: First Results from a Skipper CCD Focal Plane Prototype at SIFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first on-sky results from an ultra-low-readout-noise Skipper CCD focal plane prototype for the SOAR Integral Field Spectrograph (SIFS). The Skipper CCD focal plane consists of four 6k x 1k, 15 $\mu$m pixel, fully-depleted, p-channel devices that have been thinned to ~250 $\mu$m, backside processed, and treated with an anti-reflective coating. These Skipper CCDs were configured for astronomical spectroscopy, i.e., single-sample readout noise &lt; 4.3 e- rms/pixel, the ability to achieve multi-sample readout noise $\ll$ 1 e- rms/pixel, full-well capacities ~40,000-65,000 e-, low dark current and charge transfer inefficiency (~2 x 10$^{-4}$ e-/pixel/s and 3.44 x 10$^{-7}$, respectively), and an absolute quantum efficiency of $\gtrsim$ 80% between 450 nm and 980 nm ($\gtrsim$ 90% between 600 nm and 900 nm). We optimized the readout sequence timing to achieve sub-electron noise (~0.5 e- rms/pixel) in a region of 2k x 4k pixels and photon-counting noise (~0.22 e- rms/pixel) in a region of 220 x 4k pixels, each with a readout time of $\lesssim$ 17 min. We observed two quasars (HB89 1159+123 and QSO J1621-0042) at redshift z ~ 3.5, two high-redshift galaxy clusters (CL J1001+0220 and SPT-CL J2040-4451), an emission line galaxy at z = 0.3239, a candidate member star of the Bo\"{o}tes II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, and five CALSPEC spectrophotometric standard stars (HD074000, HD60753, HD106252, HD101452, HD200654). We present charge-quantized, photon-counting observations of the quasar HB89 1159+123 and show the detector sensitivity increase for faint spectral features. We demonstrate signal-to-noise performance improvements for SIFS observations in the low-background, readout-noise-dominated regime. We outline scientific studies that will leverage the SIFS-Skipper CCD data and new detector architectures that utilize the Skipper floating gate amplifier with faster readout times.</description>

      <title>The MIRI/MRS Library I. Empirically correcting detector charge migration in unresolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST has been collecting scientific data for over two years now. Scientists are now looking deeper into the data, which introduces the need to correct known systematic effects. Important limiting factors for the MIRI/MRS are the pointing accuracy, non-linearity, detector charge migration, detector scattering, the accuracy of the PSF model, and the complex interplay between these. The Cycle 2 programme 3779 proposed a 72-point intra-pixel dither raster of the calibration star 10-Lac. In this first work of the paper series, we aim to address the degeneracy between the non-linearity and BFE that affect the pixel voltage integration ramps of the MRS. Due to the low flux in the longer wavelengths, we only do this in the 4.9 to 11.7 micron region. We fitted the ramps per pixel and dither, in order to fold in the deviations from classical non-linearity that are caused by charge migration. The ramp shapes should be repeatable depending on the part of the PSF that is sampled. By doing so, we defined both a grid-based linearity correction, and an interpolated linearity correction. We find significant improvements compared to the uniform illumination assumption. The standard deviation on the pixel ramp residual non-linearity is between 70-90% smaller than the current standard pipeline when self-calibrating with the grid. We are able to interpolate these coefficients to apply to any unresolved source not on the grid points, resulting in an up to 70% smaller standard deviation on the residual deviation from linearity. The FWHM is up to 20% narrower. The depth of the fringes is now consistent up the ramp. Pointing-specific linearity corrections allow us to fix the systematic deviation in the slopes. We demonstrated this for unresolved sources. The discovered trends with PSF sampling suggest that, we may be able to model ramps for spatially extended and resolved illumination as well.</description>

      <title>Simons Observatory: Observatory Scheduler and Automated Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a next-generation ground-based telescope located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, designed to map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with unprecedented precision. The observatory consists of three small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one large aperture telescope (LAT), each optimized for distinct but complementary scientific goals. To achieve these goals, optimized scan strategies have been defined for both the SATs and LAT. This paper describes a software system deployed in SO that effectively translates high-level scan strategies into realistic observing scripts executable by the telescope, taking into account realistic observational constraints. The data volume of SO also necessitates a scalable software infrastructure to support its daily data processing needs. This paper also outlines an automated workflow system for managing data packaging and daily data reduction at the site.</description>

      <title>Weather conditions at Timau National Observatory from ERA5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new observatory site should be investigated for its local climate conditions to see its potential and limitations. In this respect, we examine several meteorological parameters at the site of Timau National Observatory, Indonesia using the ERA5 dataset from 2002 to 2021. Based on this dataset, we conclude that the surface temperature at Timau is around 18.9 C with a relatively small temperature variation (1.5 C) over the day. This temperature stability is expected to give advantages to the observatory. In terms of humidity and water vapour, Timau is poor for infrared observations as the median precipitable water vapour exceeds 18 mm, even during the dry season. However, near-infrared observations are feasible. Even though our cloud cover analysis confirms the span of the observing season in the region, we find a significant discrepancy between the clear sky fraction derived from the ERA5 dataset and the one estimated using satellite imagery. Aside from the indicated bias, our results provide insights and directions for the operation and future development of the observatory.</description>

      <title>The Optical Design Concept for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) aims to be the premier next generation large diameter (50-meter) single dish observatory capable of observations across the millimeter/sub-millimeter spectrum, from 30 to 950~GHz. The large primary mirror diameter, the 2-degree field of view and its large 4.7-meter focal surface give AtLAST a high throughput (aperture size times field of view) and grasp (throughput times spectral reach), with the ability to illuminate $&gt;\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ detectors. The optical design concept for AtLAST consists of a numerically optimized two-mirror Ritchey-Chr\'etien system with an additional flat folding mirror, which enables a quick selection among its planned six instrument positions. We present the optical design concept and discuss the expected optical performance of AtLAST. We then present design concepts that can be implemented in the receiver and instrument optics to correct for astigmatism and mitigate the high degree of curvature of the focal surface in order to recover significant fractions of the geometric field of view at sub-millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Astrometry as a Tool for Discovering and Weighing Faint Companions to Nearby Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the use of absolute astrometry, in particular from the combination of the Hipparcos and Gaia missions, to identify faint companions to nearby stars and to measure the masses and orbits of those companions. Absolute astrometry has been used with increasing success to discover new planets and brown dwarfs and to measure masses and orbits for systems with periods as long as centuries. This tutorial summarizes the nature of the underlying astrometric data, the approach typically used to fit orbits, and the assumptions about that data implicit throughout the process. It attempts to provide intuition for the sensitivity of astrometry as a function of stellar and companion properties and how the available constraints depend on the character and quantity of data available. This tutorial is written for someone with some background in astronomy but with no more than a minimal acquaintance with astrometry or orbit fitting.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the quantum properties of ultralight dark matter -- an open quantum systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining insight into the constituents of dark matter and their interactions with normal matter has inspired a wide range of experimental efforts. Several approaches, particularly those involving searches for ultralight bosonic dark matter (UBDM) fields, involve the use of quantum systems or measurements performed at the limits imposed by quantum mechanics. While a classical treatment of UBDM and its detectors is satisfactory, a fully quantum description would assist in developing future detection strategies. Here, we present an open quantum systems approach that accomplishes this while providing intuition into the quantum nature of the detection process itself. Furthermore, we apply the quantum theory of optical coherence to characterize the statistical properties of the UBDM field. Using representative examples, we show that this theoretical treatment has implications in uncovering signatures of the cosmological production mechanism of the UBDM field and its galactic merger history. By adapting tools from quantum optics, this work will help facilitate the creation of novel methods to extract astrophysically relevant information from correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Task Force Report for the American Astronomical Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS, finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences. We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits -- particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint. They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more inclusive, and more productive.</description>

      <title>Four microlensing giant planets detected through signals produced by minor-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the nature of the anomalies appearing in four microlensing events KMT-2020-BLG-0757, KMT-2022-BLG-0732, KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and KMT-2022-BLG-1852. The light curves of these events commonly exhibit initial bumps followed by subsequent troughs that extend across a substantial portion of the light curves. We performed thorough modeling of the anomalies to elucidate their characteristics. Despite their prolonged durations, which differ from the usual brief anomalies observed in typical planetary events, our analysis revealed that each anomaly in these events originated from a planetary companion located within the Einstein ring of the primary star. It was found that the initial bump arouse when the source star crossed one of the planetary caustics, while the subsequent trough feature occurred as the source traversed the region of minor image perturbations lying between the pair of planetary caustics. The estimated masses of the host and planet, their mass ratios, and the distance to the discovered planetary systems are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm J}, q/10^{-3}, \dl/{\rm kpc}) = (0.58^{+0.33}_{-0.30}, 10.71^{+6.17}_{-5.61}, 17.61\pm 2.25,6.67^{+0.93}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2020-BLG-0757, $(0.53^{+0.31}_{-0.31}, 1.12^{+0.65}_{-0.65}, 2.01 \pm 0.07, 6.66^{+1.19}_{-1.84})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-0732, $(0.42^{+0.32}_{-0.23}, 6.64^{+4.98}_{-3.64}, 15.07\pm 0.86, 7.55^{+0.89}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and $(0.32^{+0.34}_{-0.19}, 4.98^{+5.42}_{-2.94}, 8.74\pm 0.49, 6.27^{+0.90}_{-1.15})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1852. These parameters indicate that all the planets are giants with masses exceeding the mass of Jupiter in our solar system and the hosts are low-mass stars with masses substantially less massive than the Sun.</description>

      <title>Predicting Exoplanetary Features with a Residual Model for Uniform and Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of technology has led to rampant growth in data collection across almost every field, including astrophysics, with researchers turning to machine learning to process and analyze this data. One prominent example of this data in astrophysics is the atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets. In order to help bridge the gap between machine learning and astrophysics domain experts, the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge was hosted to predict posterior distributions of 7 exoplanetary features. The procedure outlined in this paper leveraged a combination of two deep learning models to address this challenge: a Multivariate Gaussian model that generates the mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and a Uniform Quantile model that predicts quantiles for use as the upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. Training of the Multivariate Gaussian model was found to be unstable, while training of the Uniform Quantile model was stable. An ensemble of uniform distributions was found to have competitive results during testing (posterior score of 696.43), and when combined with a multivariate Gaussian distribution achieved a final rank of third in the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge (final score of 681.57).</description>

      <title>Advancing Solar Flare Prediction using Deep Learning with Active Region Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for leveraging shape-based characteristics of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches and provide a novel capability for predicting solar flares covering the entirety of the solar disk (AR patches spanning from -90$^{\circ}$ to +90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude). We create three deep learning models: (i) ResNet34, (ii) MobileNet, and (iii) MobileViT to predict $\geq$M-class flares and assess the efficacy of these models across various ranges of solar longitude. Given the inherent imbalance in our data, we employ augmentation techniques alongside undersampling during the model training phase, while maintaining imbalanced partitions in the testing data for realistic evaluation. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, computed as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare models. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel capability in solar flare prediction that allows predicting flares for each ARs throughout the solar disk and evaluate and compare the performance, (ii) Our candidate model (MobileNet) achieves a CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.60 and HSS=0.44), CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.59 and HSS=0.44), and CSS=0.48 (TSS=0.56 and HSS=0.40) for AR patches within $\pm$30$^{\circ}$, $\pm$60$^{\circ}$, $\pm$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90 $^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.39 (TSS=0.48 and HSS=0.32), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advancement opens new avenues for more reliable prediction of solar flares, thereby contributing to improved forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance could be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with the null stream from Sagnac configuration. The combined data streams, two science observables from the hybrid Relay and a null observable from the Sagnac, could form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs for Astronomical Entity Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an experiment conducted during a hackathon, focusing on using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graph clustering to extract entities and relationships from astronomical text. The study demonstrates an approach to disambiguate entities that can appear in various contexts within the astronomical domain. By collecting excerpts around specific entities and leveraging the GPT-4 language model, relevant entities and relationships are extracted. The extracted information is then used to construct a knowledge graph, which is clustered using the Leiden algorithm. The resulting Leiden communities are utilized to identify the percentage of association of unknown excerpts to each community, thereby enabling disambiguation. The experiment showcases the potential of combining LLMs and knowledge graph clustering techniques for information extraction in astronomical research. The results highlight the effectiveness of the approach in identifying and disambiguating entities, as well as grouping them into meaningful clusters based on their relationships.</description>

Abstract: ESA's PLATO mission aims the detection and characterization of terrestrial planets around solar-type stars as well as the study of host star properties. The noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) is the main performance parameter of the PLATO instrument, which consists of 24 Normal Cameras and 2 Fast Cameras. In order to justify, verify and breakdown NSR-relevant requirements the software simulator PINE was developed. PINE models the signal pathway from a target star to the digital output of a camera based on physical models and considers the major noise contributors. In this paper, the simulator's coarse mode is introduced which allows fast performance analyses on instrument level. The added value of PINE is illustrated by exemplary applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers have been studied in great detail, no comprehensive simulation study of the neutron component is available. This is related to the complexity of neutron transport processes that is typically not treated in standard simulation tools. In this work we use the Monte Carlo simulation package Fluka to study the production and the transport of neutrons in extensive air showers over the full range of neutron energies, extending down to thermal neutrons. The importance of different neutron production mechanisms and their impact on predicted neutron distributions in energy, lateral distance, atmospheric depth, and arrival time are discussed. In addition, the dependencies of the predictions on the properties of the primary particle are studied. The results are compared to the equivalent distributions of muons, which serve as reference.</description>

Abstract: Imaging is the process of transforming noisy, incomplete data into a space that humans can interpret. NIFTy is a Bayesian framework for imaging and has already successfully been applied to many fields in astrophysics. Previous design decisions held the performance and the development of methods in NIFTy back. We present a rewrite of NIFTy, coined NIFTy.re, which reworks the modeling principle, extends the inference strategies, and outsources much of the heavy lifting to JAX. The rewrite dramatically accelerates models written in NIFTy, lays the foundation for new types of inference machineries, improves maintainability, and enables interoperability between NIFTy and the JAX machine learning ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph in Astronomical Research with Large Language Models: Quantifying Driving Forces in Interdisciplinary Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying and predicting the factors that contribute to the success of interdisciplinary research is crucial for advancing scientific discovery. However, there is a lack of methods to quantify the integration of new ideas and technological advancements in astronomical research and how these new technologies drive further scientific breakthroughs. Large language models, with their ability to extract key concepts from vast literature beyond keyword searches, provide a new tool to quantify such processes. In this study, we extracted concepts in astronomical research from 297,807 publications between 1993 and 2024 using large language models, resulting in a set of 24,939 concepts. These concepts were then used to form a knowledge graph, where the link strength between any two concepts was determined by their relevance through the citation-reference relationships. By calculating this relevance across different time periods, we quantified the impact of numerical simulations and machine learning on astronomical research. The knowledge graph demonstrates two phases of development: a phase where the technology was integrated and another where the technology was explored in scientific discovery. The knowledge graph reveals that despite machine learning has made much inroad in astronomy, there is currently a lack of new concept development at the intersection of AI and Astronomy, which may be the current bottleneck preventing machine learning from further transforming the field of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optics with dLux I: Deep calibration of Flat Field and Phase Retrieval with Automatic Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity limits of space telescopes are imposed by uncalibrated errors in the point spread function, photon-noise, background light, and detector sensitivity. These are typically calibrated with specialized wavefront sensor hardware and with flat fields obtained on the ground or with calibration sources, but these leave vulnerabilities to residual time-varying or non-common path aberrations and variations in the detector conditions. It is therefore desirable to infer these from science data alone, facing the prohibitively high dimensional problems of phase retrieval and pixel-level calibration. We introduce a new Python package for physical optics simulation, dLux, which uses the machine learning framework JAX to achieve GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation (autodiff), and apply this to simulating astronomical imaging. In this first of a series of papers, we show that gradient descent enabled by autodiff can be used to simultaneously perform phase retrieval and calibration of detector sensitivity, scaling efficiently to inferring millions of parameters. This new framework enables high dimensional optimization and inference in data analysis and hardware design in astronomy and beyond, which we explore in subsequent papers in this series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of astronomical hardware operating at the diffraction limit requires optimization of physical optical simulations of the instrument with respect to desired figures of merit, such as throughput or astrometric accuracy. These systems can be high dimensional, with highly nonlinear relationships between outputs and the adjustable parameters of the hardware. In this series of papers we present and apply dLux, an open-source end-to-end differentiable optical modelling framework. Automatic differentiation enables not just efficient high-dimensional optimization of astronomical hardware designs, but also Bayesian experimental design directly targeting the precision of experimental outcomes. Automatic second derivatives enable the exact and numerically stable calculation of parameter covariance forecasts, and higher derivatives of these enable direct optimization of these forecasts. We validate this method against analytic theory and illustrate its utility in evaluating the astrometric precision of a parametrized telescope model, and the design of a diffractive pupil to achieve optimal astrometric performance for exoplanet searches. The source code and tutorial software are open source and publicly available, targeting researchers who may wish to harness dLux for their own optical simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet astronomical spectrograph calibration with laser frequency combs from nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomical precision spectroscopy underpins searches for life beyond Earth, direct observation of the expanding Universe and constraining the potential variability of physical constants across cosmological scales. Laser frequency combs can provide the critically required accurate and precise calibration to the astronomical spectrographs. For cosmological studies, extending the calibration with such astrocombs to the ultraviolet spectral range is highly desirable, however, strong material dispersion and large spectral separation from the established infrared laser oscillators have made this exceedingly challenging. Here, we demonstrate for the first time astronomical spectrograph calibrations with an astrocomb in the ultraviolet spectral range below 400 nm. This is accomplished via chip-integrated highly nonlinear photonics in periodically-poled, nano-fabricated lithium niobate waveguides in conjunction with a robust infrared electro-optic comb generator, as well as a chip-integrated microresonator comb. These results demonstrate a viable route towards astronomical precision spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and may contribute to unlocking the full potential of next generation ground- and future space-based astronomical instruments.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging Detection of the Protoplanet AB Aurigae b at Wavelengths Covering Pa$\beta$: Rebuttal to Biddle et al. (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Biddle et al. (2024) claimed a non-detection of the protoplanet AB Aurigae b in Keck/NIRC2 Pa$\beta$ imaging. I reprocess these newly-public data and compare them to data from the extreme AO platform (SCExAO/CHARIS) used to discover AB Aur b. AB Aur b is decisively imaged with SCExAO/CHARIS at wavelengths covering Pa$\beta$. The Biddle et al. non detection of AB Aur b results from a far poorer image quality that is non competitive with SCExAO/CHARIS. Their contrast limits and thus constraints on accretion are overestimated due to an inaccurate AB Aur b source model. Consequentially, the revised Pa$\beta$ 2-$\sigma$ upper limit from these data is about three times higher than previously reported. Irrespective of image quality, single-band Pa$\beta$ imaging is ill suited to conclusively identifying accretion onto AB Aur b. Instead, high-resolution H$\alpha$ spectroscopy may provide accretion signatures. Aside from PDS 70, AB Aurigae remains the system with the strongest evidence for having a directly-imaged protoplanet.</description>

Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>
