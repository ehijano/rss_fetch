      <title>Characterization of the Deep, Extended Kuiper Belt in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Roman Space Telescope survey to investigate fundamental properties of the distant solar system in the region of the Kuiper Belt where object characteristics and the size distribution are inaccessible from any other telescope. Our pointing is coincident with the search space accessible to NASA's New Horizons spacecraft meaning, that a discovered object sufficiently near the orbit of New Horizons would potentially be investigated by a close flyby. In addition, numerous objects expected to be discovered by this search can be observed in the distance by New Horizons allowing their surface properties and satellite systems to both be probed. As designed, this survey will discover and determine orbits for as many as 900 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), providing a unique opportunity for ground-breaking Kuiper Belt science. It will simultaneously: (1) Probe and characterize the deep Kuiper Belt by identifying objects as small as a few km and taking our understanding of the size distribution to a new level. This has implications for understanding the the standard model (the Streaming Instability) of KBO formation and elucidating crater formation physics on these icy bodies. (2) Open KBO rotation studies, in particular of those objects with long rotation periods,(3) Discover and characterize KBO binaries at large distances, important because their duplicity offers information about object densities at these distant locations from the Sun. (4) Shed light on the cratering history of KBOs and improving the dating of the surfaces of Arrokoth, Pluto and Charon in addition to helping to place the 32 distant KBOs New Horizons has observed in context. This project also has synergies with transiting exoplanet studies due to the stellar density of our search fields. Coupled with our timing requirements it is sensitive to discovery of hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Multi-column Compton Camera of stacked Si pixel sensors for sub-degree angular resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton camera is a sensitive imaging detector for soft gamma-rays. Compton Reconstruction can not only give imaging capability but also remove background events to achieve good sensitivity. However, the angular resolution is in principle limited to several degrees. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Compton camera incorporating shadow effects. We consider multi-column Compton camera (MCCC), consisting of stacked Si pixel sensors. Each of columns is separated each other to create shadow effects. This design achieves an angular resolution of less than 1 degree within around 1 degree from the center of the field-of-view by just modifying a conventional Si-stacked Compton camera and keeping advantages (wide field-of-view and good sensitivity) of conventional Compton camera. Here we validated the concept of proposed Compton camera through Monte-Carlo simulation. MCCC with 1 m column height, 0.5 mm pixel size, 100 layers, and 10 columns for the 1-D direction can distinguish two sources separated by 0.1 degree with 0.6M Compton-reconstructed events.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Astrometric Catalogue and Secular Aberration Drift in Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper demonstrated the existence of a secular aberration drift term in stellar proper motions that arises when transforming an astrometric catalogue defined for an observer at rest with respect to the solar system barycentre to some other reference frame in which, for example, the observer is at rest with respect to the Galactic centre. Such a transformation requires an accurate and precise estimate of the velocity of the solar system barycentre. It was argued that the Gaia catalogue construction should account for this effect and also for the aberrational effect due to acceleration of the solar system barycentre. We argue that these two effects should not be accounted for in the construction of the Gaia astrometric catalogue. We briefly review the Gaia catalogue reference frame, the concepts of stellar aberration and secular aberration drift, and their observable consequences. The Gaia catalogue is (and should be) constructed in the Barycentric Celestial Reference System: the reference system with the origin at the solar system barycentre as defined by the underlying solar system ephemerides. We explain that the Gaia catalogue is consistent with the International Celestial Reference System despite the presence of proper motion terms due to the acceleration of the solar system barycentre. We also explain why transformation of the astrometry to a frame in which the observer is at rest with respect to the Galactic centre or distant universe is not needed for the interpretation of stellar kinematics, and that there are practical concerns with such a transformation. The estimation of the velocity and acceleration of the solar system barycentre, although important as a matter of scientific investigation, are not needed for the construction of the Gaia astrometric catalogue.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of the offset between UTC and its prediction broadcast by the GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to report in the Section 4 of BIPM Circular T daily values of the offset between UTC and the predictions of UTC broadcast by the GNSS, this quantity we name bUTC_GNSS. In this approach, the determination of UTC - bUTC_GNSS is based on data collected by several multi-GNSS stations in selected time laboratories worldwide. Test computations over a 7-month period from July 2022 to January 2023 show that the offset between UTC and bUTC_GNSS was between 30 and 50 ns for GLONASS, between 5 and 20 ns for BeiDou, and between -5 and +5 ns for GPS and Galileo. We derive the uncertainty on the reported values, which is 4.1 ns for BeiDou and GPS, 3.7 ns for Galileo and 6.6 ns for GLONASS and show that, over the test period, the reported values of UTC - bUTC_GNSS and the solutions obtained from each multi-GNSS station are all consistent within the 1-sigma uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic AGN survey at $z$ $\sim$ 2 with NTT/SOFI for GRAVITY+ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of GRAVITY+, the upgrade to the beam combiner GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), fainter and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are becoming observable, opening an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the cosmic coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. To identify an initial sample of high-redshift type~1 AGNs that can be observed with GRAVITY+, we have obtained spectroscopic data with NTT/SOFI of the most promising candidates. Our goal is to measure their broad line region (BLR) fluxes and assess their physical geometries by analysing the spectral profiles of their Balmer lines. We present 29 $z$ $\sim$ 2 targets with strong H$\alpha$ emission in the $K$-band. Their line profiles are strongly non-Gaussian, with a narrow core and broad wings. This can be explained as a combination of rotation and turbulence contributing to the total profile or two physically distinct inner and outer regions. We find small H$\alpha$ virial factors, which we attribute to the low full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)/$\sigma$ ratios of their non-Gaussian profiles, noting that this can lead to discrepancies in black hole masses derived from scaling relations. We also find two targets that show tentative evidence of BLRs dominated by radial motions. Lastly, we estimate the expected differential phase signals that will be seen with GRAVITY+, which will provide guidance for the observing strategy that will be adopted.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>

      <title>The GECAM Ground Search System for Gamma-ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of time-domain, multi-messenger astronomy, the detection of transient events on the high-energy electromagnetic sky has become more important than ever. The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a dedicated mission to monitor gamma-ray transients, launched in December, 2020. A real-time on-board trigger and location software, using the traditional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method for blind search, is constrained to relatively bright signals due to the limitations in on-board computing resources and the need for real-time search. In this work, we developed a ground-based pipeline for GECAM to search for various transients, especially for weak bursts missed by on-board software. This pipeline includes both automatic and manual mode, offering options for blind search and targeted search. The targeted search is specifically designed to search for interesting weak bursts, such as gravitational wave-associated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From the ground search of the data in the first year, GECAM has been triggered by 54 GRBs and other transients, including soft gamma-ray repeaters, X-ray binaries, solar flares, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. We report the properties of each type of triggers,such as trigger time and light curves. With this search pipeline and assuming a soft Band spectrum, the GRB detection sensitivity of GECAM is increased to about 1.1E-08 erg cm-2 s-1 (10 keV - 1000 keV, burst duration of 20 s). These results demonstrate that the GECAM ground search system (both blind search and targeted search) is a versatile pipeline to recover true astrophysical signals which were too weak to be found in the on-board search.</description>

      <title>Design of the full-sky scanning strategy and systematic effect control in a cosmic microwave background probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for primordial $B$-mode polarization signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major goal of contemporary cosmology. Detecting these signatures would confirm primordial gravitational waves and allow precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, which is crucial for distinguishing between inflationary models. This requires high-precision, full-sky observations from space-based platforms to avoid atmospheric fluctuations and windows. Since $B$-mode signatures are much fainter than CMB temperature anisotropies, their detection requires well-designed calibration and mitigation strategies. Next-generation space observatories such as LiteBIRD, which use Half-Wave Plate (HWP) modulation technology, represent a significant advance. This technology allows single-detector observations, eliminating the need for differential detection and its associated systematic complexities. The study begins with the optimization of scan strategy parameters for missions with HWP to improve in-flight calibration, suppress systematic effects, and develop robust null-test methods. In addition, we present a method for calculating the impact of systematic effects on the estimation of $r$ using the SBM software framework, which performs fast mapping in spin space. This method allows the decomposition and elimination of systematic effects in terms of spins, and we demonstrate the elimination of several systematic effects.</description>

      <title>A Linear Decomposition Method to Analyze and Study Pulsar Mode Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed compact objects with DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from isolated compact objects and those in binary systems aim to detect non-axisymmetric, deformed neutron stars at particular locations in the Galaxy or all-sky. However, a large fraction of known pulsars have rotational frequencies that lie outside the audio frequency band, rendering current detectors insensitive to these pulsars. In this work, we show that DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave interferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g. hybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible compact objects that could be detected with such high deformations, both via their individual continuous gravitational-wave emission and the stochastic gravitational-wave background created by a superposition of gravitational waves from the $\sim 10^8$ compact objects in the Galaxy. Furthermore, we show that the existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter space at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated compact objects and those in binary systems. For known pulsars, we will be able to both beat the spin-down limit and probe the Brans-Dicke modified theory of gravity parameter $\zeta&lt;1$ for approximately 85% of known pulsars with $f_{\rm gw}&lt;10$ Hz, the latter of which is currently only possible for $O(10)$ pulsars. DECIGO will thus open a new window to probe highly deformed compact objects and over half of the known pulsars, both of which are currently inaccessible to ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of cross-coupling and reflection systematics in 21cm array visibility data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with radio arrays that target the 21-cm signal originating from the early Universe suffer from a variety of systematic effects. An important class of these are reflections and spurious couplings between antennas. We apply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to the modelling and mitigation of these systematics in simulated Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) data. This method allows us to form statistical uncertainty estimates for both our models and the recovered visibilities, which is an important ingredient in establishing robust upper limits on the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum. In cases where the noise is large compared to the EoR signal, this approach can constrain the systematics well enough to mitigate them down to the noise level for both systematics studied. Incoherently averaging the recovered power spectra can further reduce the noise and improve recovery. Where the noise level is lower than the EoR, our modelling can mitigate the majority of the reflections and coupling with there being only a minor level of residual systematics. Our approach performs similarly to existing filtering/fitting techniques used in the HERA pipeline, but with the added benefit of rigorously propagating uncertainties. In all cases it does not significantly attenuate the underlying signal.</description>

Abstract: LOFAR is a low-frequency array distributed across several European countries. Each LOFAR station contains thousands of antennas and associated electronics, making monitoring and thorough testing of those components essential to ensuring station reliability. This paper discusses various anomalies that may arise in LOFAR antennas, tile elements, modems, and summators. We also introduce two diagnostic pipelines designed to detect these anomalies: a real-time station monitoring system and an offline stationtest system. These pipelines provide valuable insights into the operational status of each antenna, issuing alerts to minimize observational disruptions while maximizing station uptime, reliability, and sensitivity. By enhancing the efficiency and stability of LOFAR stations, they also serve as a foundation for future large-scale arrays like SKA-Low. The experience gained from their development and deployment will contribute to the construction and maintenance of SKA-Low, improving monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for large-scale antenna networks. Ultimately, these systems play a crucial role in ensuring continuous observations and maintaining data integrity.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>

Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. With incorporated eleven-grid interpolation technique MARFA shows good performance in computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5*10E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two parametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to modify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the waveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and recoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC and can be used to do PE with the parametrization presented in this paper.</description>
