      <title>Matched pairs and double construction bialgebras of (transposed) Poisson 3-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double construction bialgebras for Poisson 3-Lie algebras and transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras are defined and studied using matched pairs. Poisson 3-Lie algebras and transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras are constructed on direct sums and tensor products of vector spaces. Matched pairs, Manin triples, and double construction Poisson 3-Lie bialgebras are shown to be equivalent. Since the double construction approach does not apply to bialgebra theory for transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras, admissible transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras are both transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras and Poisson 3-Lie algebras. An equivalence between matched pairs and double construction admissible transposed Poisson 3-Lie bialgebras is established.</description>

      <title>Some functor calculus on semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functorial framework for the ideal theory of commutative semirings using coherent frames and spectral spaces. Two central constructions-the radical ideal functor and the $k$-radical ideal functor-are shown to yield coherent frames, with the latter forming a dense sublocale of the former. We define a natural transformation between these functors and analyze their categorical and topological properties.
  Further, we introduce a notion of support that assigns to each semiring a bounded distributive lattice whose spectrum is homeomorphic to its prime spectrum. This enables the reconstruction of the radical ideal frame via lattice-theoretic data. Applications include adjunctions between quantales and complete idealic semirings; and a comparison of prime and $k$-prime spectra in semisimple $r$-semirings. Our results unify various spectral constructions in semiring theory through a categorical and pointfree perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a description of prepositive cones -- a notion of ordering on algebras with involution introduced by Astier and Unger -- in the specific context of quaternion algebras with involution. Our main result establishes that, for a broad class of quaternion algebras with involution, every prepositive cone is maximal.</description>

      <title>Brick-splitting Torsion Pairs and Trim Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is a trim lattice. We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</description>

      <title>Minimal operations over permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.</description>

      <title>A characterization of root systems from the viewpoint of denominator formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Root systems are sets with remarkable symmetries and therefore they appear in many situations in mathematics. Among others, denominator formulae of root systems are very beautiful and mysterious equations which have several meanings from a variety of disciplines in mathematics. In this paper, we show a converse statement of this phenomena. Namely, for a given finite subset $ S $ of a Euclidean vector space $ V $, define an equation $ F $ in the group ring $ {\mathbb{Z}}[V] $ featuring the product part of denominator formulae. Then, a geometric condition for the support of $ F $ characterizes $ S $ being a set of positive roots of a finite/affine root system, recovering the denominator formula. This gives a novel characterization of the sets of positive roots of reduced finite/affine root systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized electrical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>

      <title>Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Double of Hopf Algebras Realized via Partial Dualization and the Tensor Category of Its Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the (generalized) quantum double $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ determined by a (skew) pairing between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}$ and $H$, especially the tensor category $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ of its finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we show that $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ is a left partially dualized (quasi-)Hopf algebra of $K^\mathrm{op}\otimes H$, and use this formulation to establish tensor equivalences from $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ to the categories ${}^K_K\mathcal{M}^K_H$ and ${}^{K^\ast}_{K^\ast}\mathcal{M}^{H^\ast}_{K^\ast}$ of two-sided two-cosided relative Hopf modules, as well as the category ${}_H\mathfrak{YD}^K$ of relative Yetter-Drinfeld modules.</description>
