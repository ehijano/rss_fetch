      <title>Conflict-Driven Clause Learning with VSIDS Heuristics for Discrete Facility Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as a computational engine for discrete facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Stable Neuron Explanations for Trustworthy Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuron identification is a popular tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to uncover the human-interpretable concepts represented by individual neurons in deep networks. While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-Agent Intelligence Through the Lens of Small-World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixture-of-Agents Serving via Tree-Structured Routing, Adaptive Pruning, and Dependency-Aware Prefill-Decode Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.</description>

      <title>Unifying Causal Reinforcement Learning: Survey, Taxonomy, Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating causal inference (CI) with reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address critical limitations in classical RL, including low explainability, lack of robustness and generalization failures. Traditional RL techniques, which typically rely on correlation-driven decision-making, struggle when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments. Causal reinforcement learning (CRL), leveraging the foundational principles of causal inference, offers promising solutions to these challenges by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships. In this survey, we systematically review recent advancements at the intersection of causal inference and RL. We categorize existing approaches into causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability. Through this structured analysis, we identify prevailing challenges, highlight empirical successes in practical applications, and discuss open problems. Finally, we provide future research directions, underscoring the potential of CRL for developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Propose, Solve, Verify: Self-Play Through Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training models through self-play alone (without any human data) has been a longstanding goal in AI, but its effectiveness for training large language models remains unclear, particularly in code generation where rewards based on unit tests are brittle and prone to error propagation. We study self-play in the verified code generation setting, where formal verification provides reliable correctness signals. We introduce Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV) a simple self-play framework where formal verification signals are used to create a proposer capable of generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration. We use PSV to train PSV-Verus, which across three benchmarks improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines. We show that performance scales with the number of generated questions and training iterations, and through ablations identify formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal as essential ingredients for successful self-play.</description>

      <title>NEURO-GUARD: Neuro-Symbolic Generalization and Unbiased Adaptive Routing for Diagnostics -- Explainable Medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a central challenge in medical AI, particularly in settings characterized by limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes clinical decision-making. Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.
  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>NL2CA: Auto-formalizing Cognitive Decision-Making from Natural Language Using an Unsupervised CriticNL2LTL Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive computing models offer a formal and interpretable way to characterize human's deliberation and decision-making, yet their development remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.</description>

      <title>External Hippocampus: Topological Cognitive Maps for Guiding Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18190v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the External Hippocampus framework, which models language model reasoning from a cognitive dynamics perspective as the flow of information energy in semantic space. Unlike traditional weight-space optimization methods, this framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection, enabling precise navigation and intervention of energy flow at test time while avoiding substantial computational requirements and demonstrating predictable intervention patterns. The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models &lt;=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by &gt;= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as "Cognitive Vortex" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow. The framework requires no additional training, possesses autonomous growth capability, and provides an efficient and controllable topological-aware solution for small model reasoning.</description>

      <title>Sophia: A Persistent Agent Framework of Artificial Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of LLMs has elevated AI agents from task-specific tools to long-lived, decision-making entities. Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a "Persistent Agent" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life.</description>

      <title>MSC-180: A Benchmark for Automated Formal Theorem Proving from Mathematical Subject Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a core research direction in artificial intelligence for achieving formal reasoning and verification, playing a significant role in advancing machine intelligence. However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Human-Machine Partnership for Manufacturing: Enhancing Warehouse Planning through Simulation-Driven Knowledge Graphs and LLM Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing planners face complex operational challenges that require seamless collaboration between human expertise and intelligent systems to achieve optimal performance in modern production environments. Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Monitorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observability into the decision making of modern AI systems may be required to safely deploy increasingly capable agents. Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this "monitorability" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Learning of a Graph-Based Neural Network Model Without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structural-graph approach to classifying contour images in a few-shot regime without using backpropagation. The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Output Drift Detection for Breast Cancer Response Prediction in a Multisite Clinical Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern clinical decision support systems can concurrently serve multiple, independent medical imaging institutions, but their predictive performance may degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Insider Threat Detection Using GCN and Bi-LSTM with Explicit and Implicit Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) is challenging due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities performed by trusted users. This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Discounted Bayesian Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong few-shot generalization through in-context learning, yet their reasoning in dynamic and stochastic environments remains opaque. Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Vox Deorum: A Hybrid LLM Architecture for 4X / Grand Strategy Game AI -- Lessons from Civilization V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models' capacity to reason in natural language makes them uniquely promising for 4X and grand strategy games, enabling more natural human-AI gameplay interactions such as collaboration and negotiation. However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other. Our work establishes a viable architecture for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and agentic AI research.</description>

      <title>ESearch-R1: Learning Cost-Aware MLLM Agents for Interactive Embodied Search via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have empowered embodied agents with remarkable capabilities in planning and reasoning. However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., "fetch the tool" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.</description>

      <title>Reflective Confidence: Correcting Reasoning Flaws via Online Self-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency. However, ensemble-based approaches, especially self-consistency which relies on multiple reasoning trajectories, often incur substantial computational overhead. To improve efficiency, prior work has leveraged internal confidence signals, where early stopping strategies such as DeepConf reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories. However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.
  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding.</description>

      <title>Assignment-Routing Optimization: Solvers for Problems Under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problem in which items must be assigned one-to-one to placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle visiting all nodes exactly once. Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality. The results highlight the practical applicability of MIP-based JRA optimization for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics .</description>

      <title>ChronoDreamer: Action-Conditioned World Model as an Online Simulator for Robotic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.</description>

      <title>ASTIF: Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is fundamentally an information fusion challenge, yet most existing models rely on static architectures that struggle to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources or adjust to rapid regime shifts. Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.
  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.</description>

      <title>Automatic Adaptation to Concept Complexity and Subjective Natural Concepts: A Cognitive Model based on Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of concepts in short-term and long-term memory (STM and LTM, respectively). We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.</description>

      <title>IntelliCode: A Multi-Agent LLM Tutoring System with Centralized Learner Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based tutors are typically single-turn assistants that lack persistent representations of learner knowledge, making it difficult to provide principled, transparent, and long-term pedagogical support. We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.
  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage. IntelliCode demonstrates how persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design can be combined to produce transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring.</description>

      <title>Social Comparison without Explicit Inference of Others' Reward Values: A Constructive Approach Using a Probabilistic Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18687v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social comparison$\unicode{x2014}$the process of evaluating one's rewards relative to others$\unicode{x2014}$plays a fundamental role in primate social cognition. However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states.</description>

      <title>KeenKT: Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to dynamically model a student's mastery of knowledge concepts based on their historical learning interactions. Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Basis Extension and Representational Geometry: An MDL-Constrained Model of Conceptual Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept learning becomes possible only when existing representations fail to account for experience. Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?
  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.
  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.
  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.</description>

      <title>MEEA: Mere Exposure Effect-Driven Confrontational Optimization for LLM Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about the robustness of their safety alignment. While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

      <title>The Dead Salmons of AI Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a striking neuroscience study, the authors placed a dead salmon in an MRI scanner and showed it images of humans in social situations. Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science.</description>

      <title>HARBOR: Holistic Adaptive Risk assessment model for BehaviORal healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral healthcare risk assessment remains a challenging problem due to the highly multimodal nature of patient data and the temporal dynamics of mood and affective disorders. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in structured clinical risk scoring remains unclear. In this work, we introduce HARBOR, a behavioral health aware language model designed to predict a discrete mood and risk score, termed the Harbor Risk Score (HRS), on an integer scale from -3 (severe depression) to +3 (mania). We also release PEARL, a longitudinal behavioral healthcare dataset spanning four years of monthly observations from three patients, containing physiological, behavioral, and self reported mental health signals. We benchmark traditional machine learning models, proprietary LLMs, and HARBOR across multiple evaluation settings and ablations. Our results show that HARBOR outperforms classical baselines and off the shelf LLMs, achieving 69 percent accuracy compared to 54 percent for logistic regression and 29 percent for the strongest proprietary LLM baseline.</description>

      <title>CORE: Concept-Oriented Reinforcement for Bridging the Definition-Application Gap in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve challenging math exercises yet fail to apply the concept right when the problem requires genuine understanding. Popular Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines reinforce final answers but provide little fine-grained conceptual signal, so models improve at pattern reuse rather than conceptual applications. We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks. CORE unifies direct training on concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts under outcome regularization. It provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning, while remaining algorithm- and verifier-agnostic.</description>

      <title>Gabliteration: Adaptive Multi-Directional Neural Weight Modification for Selective Behavioral Alteration in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gabliteration, a novel neural weight modification technique that advances beyond traditional abliteration methods by implementing adaptive multi-directional projections with regularized layer selection. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitation of existing methods that compromise model quality while attempting to modify specific behavioral patterns. Through dynamic layer optimization, regularized projection matrices, and adaptive scaling mechanisms, we achieve theoretically superior weight modification while minimizing quality degradation in unrelated domains. We validate our method through the gabliterated-v1 model series (0.6B to 4B parameters) available on Hugging Face, demonstrating practical applicability across multiple model scales.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Bayesian Network for Robust Assessment of Casualties in Autonomous Triage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass Casualty Incidents can overwhelm emergency medical systems and resulting delays or errors in the assessment of casualties can lead to preventable deaths. We present a decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models, estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma, into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules. Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs. This approach enabled Team Chiron to achieve 4th place out of 11 teams during the 1st physical round of the DTC.</description>

      <title>Clustering-based Transfer Learning for Dynamic Multimodal MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.</description>

      <title>Training Multimodal Large Reasoning Models Needs Better Thoughts: A Three-Stage Framework for Long Chain-of-Thought Synthesis and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>ORPR: An OR-Guided Pretrain-then-Reinforce Learning Model for Inventory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.</description>

      <title>Recontextualization Mitigates Specification Gaming without Modifying the Specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at diverse tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging. Existing methods like quantization, pruning, and distillation can reduce memory footprint but often demand extensive experimentation and careful infrastructure design. Leveraging existing techniques for extracting high-level concepts (represented as steering vectors) from larger models, we investigate their transferability to smaller language models (SLM) during inference. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in last few years. In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting. Furthermore, we establish a unification framework that interprets existing test-time scaling strategies through the lens of genetic algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy with low performance variance and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference.</description>

      <title>$\gamma(3,4)$ `Attention' in Cognitive Agents: Ontology-Free Knowledge Representations With Promise Theoretic Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semantics and dynamics of `attention' are closely related to promise theoretic notions developed for autonomous agents and can thus easily be written down in promise framework. In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $\gamma(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. Appropriate attention to causal boundary conditions may lead to orders of magnitude compression of data required for such context determination, as required in the contexts of autonomous robotics, defence deployments, and ad hoc emergency services.</description>

      <title>Tool-Augmented Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Distillation for Bilingual Mathematical Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilingual mathematical problem solving needs a clear link between language reasoning and symbolic calculation. Large language models often handle language well but are weak in accurate computation. This paper presents HERALD (Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Adaptive Learning and Distillation), a framework that joins reasoning and calculation using NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B. HERALD uses adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to connect different reasoning paths. Confidence calibration keeps weighting stable, and dual-path checking keeps results correct. Reinforcement learning controls tool use to cut redundancy, and distillation lowers delay without hurting accuracy. The system shows that combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning helps achieve both fluent reasoning and precise calculation. HERALD offers a practical solution for multilingual mathematical reasoning with better accuracy, stability, and clarity.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Accept-Desirability models in the context of AGM-like belief change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.</description>

      <title>FC-MIR: A Mobile Screen Awareness Framework for Intent-Aware Recommendation based on Frame-Compressed Multimodal Trajectory Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying user intent from mobile UI operation trajectories is critical for advancing UI understanding and enabling task automation agents. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.</description>

      <title>Understanding Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Models via Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), particularly with the introduction of the long reasoning chain technique, the reasoning ability of LLMs in complex problem-solving has been significantly enhanced. While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization.</description>

      <title>Can We Test Consciousness Theories on AI? Ablations, Markers, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories.</description>

      <title>Observer, Not Player: Simulating Theory of Mind in LLMs through Game Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interactive framework for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine "understanding" in a simple yet strategic environment. As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Generation of Programmatic Rules for Document Forgery Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document forgery poses a growing threat to legal, economic, and governmental processes, requiring increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms. One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required.</description>

      <title>DeliveryBench: Can Agents Earn Profit in Real World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs and VLMs are increasingly deployed as embodied agents, yet existing benchmarks largely revolve around simple short-term tasks and struggle to capture rich realistic constraints that shape real-world decision making. To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments. Our code, data, and benchmark are available at https://deliverybench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Vibe Reasoning: Eliciting Frontier AI Mathematical Capabilities -- A Case Study on IMO 2025 Problem 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Vibe Reasoning, a human-AI collaborative paradigm for solving complex mathematical problems. Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Helios: A Foundational Language Model for Smart Energy Knowledge Reasoning and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the global drive toward carbon neutrality, deeply coordinated smart energy systems underpin industrial transformation. However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.</description>

      <title>SafeMed-R1: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable and Robust Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet their deployment in clinical settings is hindered by severe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>VIGOR+: Iterative Confounder Generation and Validation via LLM-CEVAE Feedback Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference from observational data. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility. We propose VIGOR+ (Variational Information Gain for iterative cOnfounder Refinement), a novel framework that closes the loop between LLM-based confounder generation and CEVAE-based statistical validation. Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework.</description>

      <title>PENDULUM: A Benchmark for Assessing Sycophancy in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sycophancy, an excessive tendency of AI models to agree with user input at the expense of factual accuracy or in contradiction of visual evidence, poses a critical and underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/.</description>

      <title>First-Order Representation Languages for Goal-Conditioned RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order relational languages have been used in MDP planning and reinforcement learning (RL) for two main purposes: specifying MDPs in compact form, and representing and learning policies that are general and not tied to specific instances or state spaces. In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them.</description>

      <title>Learning General Policies with Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.</description>

      <title>EchoTrail-GUI: Building Actionable Memory for GUI Agents via Critic-Guided Self-Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Materials Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness. This work establishes a verifiable foundation for autonomous computational experimentation and represents a key step toward fully automated scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>QuantiPhy: A Quantitative Benchmark Evaluating Physical Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.</description>

      <title>Towards Closed-Loop Embodied Empathy Evolution: Probing LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation in Unseen Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, existing human-centric emotional motion generation methods primarily focus on boosting performance within a single scale-fixed dataset, largely neglecting the flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios (e.g., sports, dance), whereas effectively learning these newly emerging scenarios can significantly enhance the model's real-world generalization ability. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Intelligence: A Hybrid Framework for Scalable and Stable Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) face a "Scalability-Stability Dilemma." Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) may scale easily but suffer from instability, while supervised explanation frameworks (e.g., TED) offer stability but require prohibitive human effort to label every training instance. This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel "Asymmetry of Discovery." When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad "Safety Nets" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific "Risk Traps" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of "Rule Writers" to "Exception Handlers."</description>

      <title>Scalably Enhancing the Clinical Validity of a Task Benchmark with Physician Oversight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the calculation of clinical risk scores offers a significant opportunity to reduce physician administrative burden and enhance patient care. The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Adapter LLM Serving via Cross-Model KV-Cache Reuse with Activated LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) systems increasingly rely on multi-turn pipelines that are composed of multiple task-specific adapters, yet existing serving frameworks remain inefficient, incurring substantial recomputation overhead when switching between adapters. We present the first LLM serving engine that supports cross-model prefix cache reuse between base and adapted models via Activated LoRA (aLoRA), enabling efficient and fine-grained adapter switching during inference. Our design extends the vLLM framework by introducing base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking within the model execution path, permitting cache reuse across models while preserving compatibility with existing serving engine optimizations. Integrated into a production-grade inference stack, this approach supports dynamic adapter activation without excessive key-value tensor recomputation. Evaluation across representative multi-turn, multi-adapter pipelines demonstrates up to 58x end-to-end latency reduction and over 100x time-to-first-token improvement relative to standard LoRA baselines, with benefits that scale with model size and sequence length and manifest across all stages of the request lifecycle. This work bridges parameter-efficient model adaptation with high-performance serving, providing the first complete realization of cross-model KV-cache reuse in modern LLM inference engines.</description>

      <title>Towards Reasoning-Preserving Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to erase requested data from trained models without full retraining. For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention.</description>

      <title>Graph-O1 : Monte Carlo Tree Search with Reinforcement Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT said: Text-attributed graphs, where nodes and edges contain rich textual information, are widely used across diverse domains. A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Multi-Agent System for Healthcare: A Gossip Protocol Approach to Secure Medical Message Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled sophisticated multi-agent architectures for healthcare, where large language models power collaborative clinical decision-making. However, these distributed systems face critical challenges in ensuring message integrity and fault tolerance when operating in adversarial or untrusted environments.This paper presents a novel Byzantine fault-tolerant multi-agent system specifically designed for healthcare applications, integrating gossip-based message propagation with cryptographic validation mechanisms. Our system employs specialized AI agents for diagnosis, treatment planning, emergency response, and data analysis, coordinated through a Byzantine consensus protocol that tolerates up to f faulty nodes among n = 3f + 1 total nodes. We implement a gossip protocol for decentralized message dissemination, achieving consensus with 2f + 1 votes while maintaining system operation even under Byzantine failures. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully validates medical messages with cryptographic signatures, prevents replay attacks through timestamp validation, and maintains consensus accuracy of 100% with up to 33% Byzantine nodes. The system provides real-time visualization of consensus rounds, vote tallies, and network topology, enabling transparent monitoring of fault-tolerant operations. This work contributes a practical framework for building secure, resilient healthcare multi-agent systems capable of collaborative medical decision-making in untrusted environments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Prioritize IT Tickets: A Comparative Evaluation of Embedding-based Approaches and Fine-Tuned Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prioritizing service tickets in IT Service Management (ITSM) is critical for operational efficiency but remains challenging due to noisy textual inputs, subjective writing styles, and pronounced class imbalance. We evaluate two families of approaches for ticket prioritization: embedding-based pipelines that combine dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classical classifiers, and a fine-tuned multilingual transformer that processes both textual and numerical features. Embedding-based methods exhibit limited generalization across a wide range of thirty configurations, with clustering failing to uncover meaningful structures and supervised models highly sensitive to embedding quality. In contrast, the proposed transformer model achieves substantially higher performance, with an average F1-score of 78.5% and weighted Cohen's kappa values of nearly 0.80, indicating strong alignment with true labels. These results highlight the limitations of generic embeddings for ITSM data and demonstrate the effectiveness of domain-adapted transformer architectures for operational ticket prioritization.</description>

      <title>KVReviver: Reversible KV Cache Compression with Sketch-Based Token Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the context length of current large language models (LLMs) rapidly increases, the memory demand for the Key-Value (KV) cache is becoming a bottleneck for LLM deployment and batch processing. Traditional KV cache compression methods typically involve permanently evicting or irreversibly merging "less important" tokens with low attention scores. This approach results in the unrecoverable loss of token information, which we call Contextual Amnesia, significantly degrading the model's information retrieval capability. To address this issue, we propose KVReviver, a reversible KV cache compression method based on the sketch algorithm. This method allows reconstructing compressed tokens from an additional data structure, thus enabling full-scale computation within limited memory. Experiments showed that in 2k-length contexts, it requires only 10% of KV Cache budget while maintaining identical end-to-end inference accuracy. For 32k-length contexts, it achieves equivalent or comparable accuracy ~2% accuracy loss) using merely 25% of KV Cache budget.</description>

      <title>Separating Constraint Compliance from Semantic Accuracy: A Novel Benchmark for Evaluating Instruction-Following Under Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit degraded performance under prompt compression, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We introduce the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT), a benchmark that independently measures constraint compliance (CC) and semantic accuracy (SA) across compression levels. We evaluate 9 frontier LLMs across 8 concepts using 5 compression levels from extreme (c=0.0, ~2 words) to none (c=1.0, ~135 words). A three-judge LLM jury achieves almost perfect inter-rater agreement on CC (Fleiss' \k{appa}=0.90).
  We observe a universal U-curve pattern in constraint compliance (97.2% prevalence), with violations peaking at medium compression (c=0.5, ~27 words). Counterintuitively, models perform better at extreme compression than medium lengths. The dimensions are statistically orthogonal (r=0.193, p=0.084), with constraint effects 2.9x larger than semantic effects.
  Experimental validation via RLHF ablation confirms our constraint salience hypothesis: removing "helpfulness" signals improves CC by 598% on average (71/72 trials, p&lt;0.001), with 79% achieving perfect compliance. This demonstrates that RLHF-trained helpfulness behaviors are the dominant cause of constraint violations at medium compression. Reasoning models outperform efficient models by 27.5% (Cohen's d=0.96).
  Our findings reveal a fundamental tension between RLHF alignment and instruction-following, providing actionable guidelines for improving deployed systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring Latent Market Forces: Evaluating LLM Detection of Gamma Exposure Patterns via Obfuscation Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce obfuscation testing, a novel methodology for validating whether large language models detect structural market patterns through causal reasoning rather than temporal association. Testing three dealer hedging constraint patterns (gamma positioning, stock pinning, 0DTE hedging) on 242 trading days (95.6% coverage) of S&amp;P 500 options data, we find LLMs achieve 71.5% detection rate using unbiased prompts that provide only raw gamma exposure values without regime labels or temporal context. The WHO-WHOM-WHAT causal framework forces models to identify the economic actors (dealers), affected parties (directional traders), and structural mechanisms (forced hedging) underlying observed market dynamics. Critically, detection accuracy (91.2%) remains stable even as economic profitability varies quarterly, demonstrating that models identify structural constraints rather than profitable patterns. When prompted with regime labels, detection increases to 100%, but the 71.5% unbiased rate validates genuine pattern recognition. Our findings suggest LLMs possess emergent capabilities for detecting complex financial mechanisms through pure structural reasoning, with implications for systematic strategy development, risk management, and our understanding of how transformer architectures process financial market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS-Assisted Communications: A Gradient-Based Meta Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to realize full-space coverage and boost spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Monetary Policy Under Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Analyzing Tabular and Function Approximation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a central bank should dynamically set short-term nominal interest rates to stabilize inflation and unemployment when macroeconomic relationships are uncertain and time-varying. We model monetary policy as a sequential decision-making problem where the central bank observes macroeconomic conditions quarterly and chooses interest rate adjustments. Using publically accessible historical Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), we construct a linear-Gaussian transition model and implement a discrete-action Markov Decision Process with a quadratic loss reward function. We chose to compare nine different reinforcement learning style approaches against Taylor Rule and naive baselines, including tabular Q-learning variants, SARSA, Actor-Critic, Deep Q-Networks, Bayesian Q-learning with uncertainty quantification, and POMDP formulations with partial observability. Surprisingly, standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 +- 309.58 mean return), outperforming both enhanced RL methods and traditional policy rules. Our results suggest that while sophisticated RL techniques show promise for monetary policy applications, simpler approaches may be more robust in this domain, highlighting important challenges in applying modern RL to macroeconomic policy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Explainable Machine Learning Versus Linear Regression for Predicting County-Level Lung Cancer Mortality Rate in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Digital Twin Learning for Edge AI: A Comparison of FPGA and Mobile GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) can enable precision healthcare by continually learning a mathematical representation of patient-specific dynamics. However, mission critical healthcare applications require fast, resource-efficient DT learning, which is often infeasible with existing model recovery (MR) techniques due to their reliance on iterative solvers and high compute/memory demands. In this paper, we present a general DT learning framework that is amenable to acceleration on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, enabling substantial speedup and energy efficiency. We compare our FPGA-based implementation with a multi-processing implementation in mobile GPU, which is a popular choice for AI in edge devices. Further, we compare both edge AI implementations with cloud GPU baseline. Specifically, our FPGA implementation achieves an 8.8x improvement in \text{performance-per-watt} for the MR task, a 28.5x reduction in DRAM footprint, and a 1.67x runtime speedup compared to cloud GPU baselines. On the other hand, mobile GPU achieves 2x better performance per watts but has 2x increase in runtime and 10x more DRAM footprint than FPGA. We show the usage of this technique in DT guided synthetic data generation for Type 1 Diabetes and proactive coronary artery disease detection.</description>

      <title>NystagmusNet: Explainable Deep Learning for Photosensitivity Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nystagmus patients with photosensitivity face significant daily challenges due to involuntary eye movements exacerbated by environmental brightness conditions. Current assistive solutions are limited to symptomatic treatments without predictive personalization. This paper proposes NystagmusNet, an AI-driven system that predicts high-risk visual environments and recommends real-time visual adaptations. Using a dual-branch convolutional neural network trained on synthetic and augmented datasets, the system estimates a photosensitivity risk score based on environmental brightness and eye movement variance. The model achieves 75% validation accuracy on synthetic data. Explainability techniques including SHAP and GradCAM are integrated to highlight environmental risk zones, improving clinical trust and model interpretability. The system includes a rule-based recommendation engine for adaptive filter suggestions. Future directions include deployment via smart glasses and reinforcement learning for personalized recommendations.</description>

      <title>Let the Model Learn to Feel: Mode-Guided Tonality Injection for Symbolic Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music emotion recognition is a key task in symbolic music understanding (SMER). Recent approaches have shown promising results by fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., MIDIBERT, a benchmark in symbolic music understanding) to map musical semantics to emotional labels. While these models effectively capture distributional musical semantics, they often overlook tonal structures, particularly musical modes, which play a critical role in emotional perception according to music psychology. In this paper, we investigate the representational capacity of MIDIBERT and identify its limitations in capturing mode-emotion associations. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Guided Enhancement (MoGE) strategy that incorporates psychological insights on mode into the model. Specifically, we first conduct a mode augmentation analysis, which reveals that MIDIBERT fails to effectively encode emotion-mode correlations. We then identify the least emotion-relevant layer within MIDIBERT and introduce a Mode-guided Feature-wise linear modulation injection (MoFi) framework to inject explicit mode features, thereby enhancing the model's capability in emotional representation and inference. Extensive experiments on the EMOPIA and VGMIDI datasets demonstrate that our mode injection strategy significantly improves SMER performance, achieving accuracies of 75.2% and 59.1%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of mode-guided modeling in symbolic music emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Which Coauthor Should I Nominate in My 99 ICLR Submissions? A Mathematical Analysis of the ICLR 2026 Reciprocal Reviewer Nomination Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conference submissions has created an overwhelming reviewing burden. To alleviate this, recent venues such as ICLR 2026 introduced a reviewer nomination policy: each submission must nominate one of its authors as a reviewer, and any paper nominating an irresponsible reviewer is desk-rejected. We study this new policy from the perspective of author welfare. Assuming each author carries a probability of being irresponsible, we ask: how can authors (or automated systems) nominate reviewers to minimize the risk of desk rejections? We formalize and analyze three variants of the desk-rejection risk minimization problem. The basic problem, which minimizes expected desk rejections, is solved optimally by a simple greedy algorithm. We then introduce hard and soft nomination limit variants that constrain how many papers may nominate the same author, preventing widespread failures if one author is irresponsible. These formulations connect to classical optimization frameworks, including minimum-cost flow and linear programming, allowing us to design efficient, principled nomination strategies. Our results provide the first theoretical study for reviewer nomination policies, offering both conceptual insights and practical directions for authors to wisely choose which co-author should serve as the nominated reciprocal reviewer.</description>

      <title>Will AI Trade? A Computational Inversion of the No-Trade Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic no-trade theorems attribute trade to heterogeneous beliefs. We re-examine this conclusion for AI agents, asking if trade can arise from computational limitations, under common beliefs. We model agents' bounded computational rationality within an unfolding game framework, where computational power determines the complexity of its strategy. Our central finding inverts the classic paradigm: a stable no-trade outcome (Nash equilibrium) is reached only when "almost rational" agents have slightly different computational power. Paradoxically, when agents possess identical power, they may fail to converge to equilibrium, resulting in persistent strategic adjustments that constitute a form of trade. This instability is exacerbated if agents can strategically under-utilize their computational resources, which eliminates any chance of equilibrium in Matching Pennies scenarios. Our results suggest that the inherent computational limitations of AI agents can lead to situations where equilibrium is not reached, creating a more lively and unpredictable trade environment than traditional models would predict.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond the Scene: Analyzing and Mitigating Background Bias in Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human action recognition models often rely on background cues rather than human movement and pose to make predictions, a behavior known as background bias. We present a systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLM) and find that all exhibit a strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Next, we propose mitigation strategies for classification models and show that incorporating segmented human input effectively decreases background bias by 3.78%. Finally, we explore manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs, demonstrating that prompt design can steer predictions towards human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment can make frontier LMs overly conservative, degrading collaboration via hedging or false refusals. We present a lightweight toolkit with three parts: (1) Victor Calibration (VC), a multi-pass protocol that elicits a scalar confidence proxy T (T0&lt;T1&lt;T2) through iterative evidence re-evaluation; (2) FD-Lite, a behavior-only phenomenology audit with a fixed anchor phrase and a meta-prefix trap to avoid anthropomorphic claims; and (3) CP4.3, a governance stress test for rank invariance and allocation monotonicity (M6). Across Claude 4.5 models (Haiku, Sonnet no-thinking, Sonnet thinking) and Opus, we observe monotonic VC trajectories without violating safety invariants, and stable CP4.3 behavior. ("Opus" here refers to a single Claude Opus 4.1 session accessed via a standard UI account, as reported in Table 1.) This work was conducted by a single operator (n=1) and is intended as hypothesis-generating; we explicitly invite replication, critique, and extension by the research community. We include prompt templates and an artifact plan to facilitate independent verification.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Human-Robot Interaction Intent Detection Using RGB-based Pose and Emotion Cues with Cross-Camera Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Service robots in public spaces require real-time understanding of human behavioral intentions for natural interaction. We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials. The close correspondence between offline and deployed performance confirms the cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness of the proposed multimodal approach, highlighting its suitability for ubiquitous multimedia-enabled social robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms are a foundational pillar of modern computational science, yet their effective application hinges on a deep understanding of their performance trade offs. This paper presents a critical analysis of the evolution of Monte Carlo algorithms, focusing on the persistent tension between statistical efficiency and computational cost. We describe the historical development from the foundational Metropolis Hastings algorithm to contemporary methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. A central emphasis of this survey is the rigorous discussion of time and space complexity, including upper, lower, and asymptotic tight bounds for each major algorithm class. We examine the specific motivations for developing these methods and the key theoretical and practical observations such as the introduction of gradient information and adaptive tuning in HMC that led to successively better solutions. Furthermore, we provide a justification framework that discusses explicit situations in which using one algorithm is demonstrably superior to another for the same problem. The paper concludes by assessing the profound significance and impact of these algorithms and detailing major current research challenges.</description>

      <title>Convolutional-neural-operator-based transfer learning for solving PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural operator is a CNN-based architecture recently proposed to enforce structure-preserving continuous-discrete equivalence and enable the genuine, alias-free learning of solution operators of PDEs. This neural operator was demonstrated to outperform for certain cases some baseline models such as DeepONet, Fourier neural operator, and Galerkin transformer in terms of surrogate accuracy. The convolutional neural operator, however, seems not to be validated for few-shot learning. We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>CodeGEMM: A Codebook-Centric Approach to Efficient GEMM in Quantized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight-only quantization is widely used to mitigate the memory-bound nature of LLM inference. Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation. On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM delivers 1.83x (8B) and 8.93x (70B) speedups in the 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization at comparable accuracy and further improves computing efficiency and memory subsystem utilization.</description>

      <title>Re-assessing the evidence for mental rotation abilities in children using computational models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is strong and diverse evidence for mental rotation (MR) abilities in adults. However, current evidence for MR in children rests on just a few behavioral paradigms adapted from the adult literature. Here, we leverage recent computational models of the development of children's object recognition abilities to re-assess the evidence for MR in children. The computational models simulate infants' acquisition of object representations during embodied interactions with objects. We consider two different object recognition strategies, different from MRs, and assess their ability to replicate results from three classical MR tasks assigned to children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Our results show that MR may play no role in producing the results obtained from children younger than 5 years. In fact, we find that a simple recognition strategy that reflects a pixel-wise comparison of stimuli is sufficient to model children's behavior in the most used MR task. Thus, our study reopens the debate on how and when children develop genuine MR abilities.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for HAR: Integrating LoRA and QLoRA into Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition is a foundational task in pervasive computing. While recent advances in self-supervised learning and transformer-based architectures have significantly improved HAR performance, adapting large pretrained models to new domains remains a practical challenge due to limited computational resources on target devices. This papers investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA, as scalable alternatives to full model fine-tuning for HAR. We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Inductive-Transductive Network for Traffic Flow Imputation on Unsampled Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately imputing traffic flow at unsensed locations is difficult: loop detectors provide precise but sparse measurements, speed from probe vehicles is widely available yet only weakly correlated with flow, and nearby links often exhibit strong heterophily in the scale of traffic flow (e.g., ramps vs. mainline), which breaks standard GNN assumptions. We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.
  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Relative to KITS, HINT reduces MAE on MOW by $\approx42$% with basic simulation and $\approx50$% with calibrated simulation; on Torino by $\approx22$%, and on Essen by $\approx12$%. Even without simulation, HINT remains superior on MOW and Torino, while simulation is crucial on Essen. These results show that combining inductive flow imputation with transductive speed, traffic simulations and external geospatial improves accuracy for the task described above.</description>

      <title>The Subject of Emergent Misalignment in Superintelligence: An Anthropological, Cognitive Neuropsychological, Machine-Learning, and Ontological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the conceptual and ethical gaps in current representations of Superintelligence misalignment. We find throughout Superintelligence discourse an absent human subject, and an under-developed theorization of an "AI unconscious" that together are potentiality laying the groundwork for anti-social harm. With the rise of AI Safety that has both thematic potential for establishing pro-social and anti-social potential outcomes, we ask: what place does the human subject occupy in these imaginaries? How is human subjecthood positioned within narratives of catastrophic failure or rapid "takeoff" toward superintelligence? On another register, we ask: what unconscious or repressed dimensions are being inscribed into large-scale AI models? Are we to blame these agents in opting for deceptive strategies when undesirable patterns are inherent within our beings? In tracing these psychic and epistemic absences, our project calls for re-centering the human subject as the unstable ground upon which the ethical, unconscious, and misaligned dimensions of both human and machinic intelligence are co-constituted. Emergent misalignment cannot be understood solely through technical diagnostics typical of contemporary machine-learning safety research. Instead, it represents a multi-layered crisis. The human subject disappears not only through computational abstraction but through sociotechnical imaginaries that prioritize scalability, acceleration, and efficiency over vulnerability, finitude, and relationality. Likewise, the AI unconscious emerges not as a metaphor but as a structural reality of modern deep learning systems: vast latent spaces, opaque pattern formation, recursive symbolic play, and evaluation-sensitive behavior that surpasses explicit programming. These dynamics necessitate a reframing of misalignment as a relational instability embedded within human-machine ecologies.</description>

      <title>Seeing Justice Clearly: Handwritten Legal Document Translation with OCR and Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) and machine translation continue to pose significant challenges, particularly for low-resource languages like Marathi, which lack large digitized corpora and exhibit high variability in handwriting styles. The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike.</description>

      <title>ReGal: A First Look at PPO-based Legal AI for Judgment Prediction and Summarization in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an early exploration of reinforcement learning methodologies for legal AI in the Indian context. We introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Legal Reasoning (ReGal), a framework that integrates Multi-Task Instruction Tuning with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our approach is evaluated across two critical legal tasks: (i) Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE), and (ii) Legal Document Summarization. Although the framework underperforms on standard evaluation metrics compared to supervised and proprietary models, it provides valuable insights into the challenges of applying RL to legal texts. These challenges include reward model alignment, legal language complexity, and domain-specific adaptation. Through empirical and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how RL can be repurposed for high-stakes, long-document tasks in law. Our findings establish a foundation for future work on optimizing legal reasoning pipelines using reinforcement learning, with broader implications for building interpretable and adaptive legal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Specification and Detection of LLM Code Smells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained massive popularity in recent years and are increasingly integrated into software systems for diverse purposes. However, poorly integrating them in source code may undermine software system quality. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no formal catalog of code smells specific to coding practices for LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LLM code smells and formalize five recurrent problematic coding practices related to LLM inference in software systems, based on relevant literature. We extend the detection tool SpecDetect4AI to cover the newly defined LLM code smells and use it to validate their prevalence in a dataset of 200 open-source LLM systems. Our results show that LLM code smells affect 60.50% of the analyzed systems, with a detection precision of 86.06%.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Benchmarks for Atrial Fibrillation Detection from Electrocardiograms of Intensive Care Unit Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia experienced by intensive care unit (ICU) patients and can cause adverse health effects. In this study, we publish a labelled ICU dataset and benchmarks for AF detection. Methods: We compared machine learning models across three data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches: feature-based classifiers, deep learning (DL), and ECG foundation models (FMs). This comparison addresses a critical gap in the literature and aims to pinpoint which AI approach is best for accurate AF detection. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a Canadian ICU and the 2021 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge were used to conduct the experiments. Multiple training configurations were tested, ranging from zero-shot inference to transfer learning. Results: On average and across both datasets, ECG FMs performed best, followed by DL, then feature-based classifiers. The model that achieved the top F1 score on our ICU test set was ECG-FM through a transfer learning strategy (F1=0.89). Conclusion: This study demonstrates promising potential for using AI to build an automatic patient monitoring system. Significance: By publishing our labelled ICU dataset (LinkToBeAdded) and performance benchmarks, this work enables the research community to continue advancing the state-of-the-art in AF detection in the ICU.</description>

      <title>Securing Agentic AI Systems -- A Multilayer Security Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securing Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems requires addressing the complex cyber risks introduced by autonomous, decision-making, and adaptive behaviors. Agentic AI systems are increasingly deployed across industries, organizations, and critical sectors such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. However, their autonomy introduces unique security challenges, including unauthorized actions, adversarial manipulation, and dynamic environmental interactions. Existing AI security frameworks do not adequately address these challenges or the unique nuances of agentic AI. This research develops a lifecycle-aware security framework specifically designed for agentic AI systems using the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. The paper introduces MAAIS, an agentic security framework, and the agentic AI CIAA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Accountability) concept. MAAIS integrates multiple defense layers to maintain CIAA across the AI lifecycle. Framework validation is conducted by mapping with the established MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) AI tactics. The study contributes a structured, standardized, and framework-based approach for the secure deployment and governance of agentic AI in enterprise environments. This framework is intended for enterprise CISOs, security, AI platform, and engineering teams and offers a detailed step-by-step approach to securing agentic AI workloads.</description>

      <title>FOODER: Real-time Facial Authentication and Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.</description>

      <title>Characterising Behavioural Families and Dynamics of Promotional Twitter Bots via Sequence-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper asks whether promotional Twitter/X bots form behavioural families and whether members evolve similarly. We analyse 2,798,672 tweets from 2,615 ground-truth promotional bot accounts (2006-2021), focusing on complete years 2009 to 2020. Each bot is encoded as a sequence of symbolic blocks (``digital DNA'') from seven categorical post-level behavioural features (posting action, URL, media, text duplication, hashtags, emojis, sentiment), preserving temporal order only. Using non-overlapping blocks (k=7), cosine similarity over block-frequency vectors, and hierarchical clustering, we obtain four coherent families: Unique Tweeters, Duplicators with URLs, Content Multipliers, and Informed Contributors. Families share behavioural cores but differ systematically in engagement strategies and life-cycle dynamics (beginning/middle/end). We then model behavioural change as mutations. Within each family we align sequences via multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and label events as insertions, deletions, substitutions, alterations, and identity. This quantifies mutation rates, change-prone blocks/features, and mutation hotspots. Deletions and substitutions dominate, insertions are rare, and mutation profiles differ by family, with hotspots early for some families and dispersed for others. Finally, we test predictive value: bots within the same family share mutations more often than bots across families; closer bots share and propagate mutations more than distant ones; and responses to external triggers (e.g., Christmas, Halloween) follow family-specific, partly predictable patterns. Overall, sequence-based family modelling plus mutation analysis provides a fine-grained account of how promotional bot behaviour adapts over time.</description>

      <title>From Prompt to Product: A Human-Centered Benchmark of Agentic App Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of generating full-stack web applications from natural language prompts ("prompt- to-app") represent a significant shift in software development. However, evaluating these systems remains challenging, as visual polish, functional correctness, and user trust are often misaligned. As a result, it is unclear how existing prompt-to-app tools compare under realistic, human-centered evaluation criteria. In this paper, we introduce a human-centered benchmark for evaluating prompt-to-app systems and conduct a large-scale comparative study of three widely used platforms: Replit, Bolt, and Firebase Studio. Using a diverse set of 96 prompts spanning common web application tasks, we generate 288 unique application artifacts. We evaluate these systems through a large-scale human-rater study involving 205 participants and 1,071 quality-filtered pairwise comparisons, assessing task-based ease of use, visual appeal, perceived completeness, and user trust. Our results show that these systems are not interchangeable: Firebase Studio consistently outperforms competing platforms across all human-evaluated dimensions, achieving the highest win rates for ease of use, trust, visual appeal, and visual appropriateness. Bolt performs competitively on visual appeal but trails Firebase on usability and trust, while Replit underperforms relative to both across most metrics. These findings highlight a persistent gap between visual polish and functional reliability in prompt-to-app systems and demonstrate the necessity of interactive, task-based evaluation. We release our benchmark framework, prompt set, and generated artifacts to support reproducible evaluation and future research in agentic application generation.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Gated Region-Level Retrieval for Robust Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of outdoor street scenes plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and assistive technology for visually-impaired pedestrians. For these applications, accurately distinguishing between key surfaces and objects such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians is essential for maintaining safety and minimizing risks. Semantic segmentation must be robust to different environments, lighting and weather conditions, and sensor noise, while being performed in real-time. We propose a region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift. Our best method achieves an 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of State-of-the-Art LLMs for Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for code generation, including both general-purpose and code-specialized models. Using a dataset of 944 real-world LeetCode problems across five programming languages, we assess model performance using rigorous metrics: compile-time errors, runtime errors, functional failures, and algorithmic suboptimalities. The results reveal significant performance variations, with DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in terms of correctness, efficiency, and robustness. Through detailed case studies, we identify common failure scenarios such as syntax errors, logical flaws, and suboptimal algorithms, highlighting the critical role of prompt engineering and human oversight in improving results. Based on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations for developers and practitioners, emphasizing that successful LLM deployment depends on careful model selection, effective prompt design, and context-aware usage to ensure reliable code generation in real-world software development tasks.</description>

      <title>Grad: Guided Relation Diffusion Generation for Graph Augmentation in Graph Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) in financial scenarios has become an urgent research topic to protect online payment security. However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively. Our code is released at https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud and https://github.com/Muyiiiii/WWW25-Grad.</description>

      <title>On Swarm Leader Identification using Probing Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.</description>

      <title>PROVEX: Enhancing SOC Analyst Trust with Explainable Provenance-Based IDS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern intrusion detection systems (IDS) leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect malicious activity in system provenance data, but their decisions often remain a black box to analysts. This paper presents a comprehensive XAI framework designed to bridge the trust gap in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) by making graph-based detection transparent. We implement this framework on top of KAIROS, a state-of-the-art temporal graph-based IDS, though our design is applicable to any temporal graph-based detector with minimal adaptation. The complete codebase is available at https://github.com/devang1304/provex.git. We augment the detection pipeline with post-hoc explanations that highlight why an alert was triggered, identifying key causal subgraphs and events. We adapt three GNN explanation methods - GraphMask, GNNExplainer, and a variational temporal GNN explainer (VA-TGExplainer) - to the temporal provenance context. These tools output human-interpretable representations of anomalous behavior, including important edges and uncertainty estimates. Our contributions focus on the practical integration of these explainers, addressing challenges in memory management and reproducibility. We demonstrate our framework on the DARPA CADETS Engagement 3 dataset and show that it produces concise window-level explanations for detected attacks. Our evaluation reveals that the explainers preserve the TGNN's decisions with high fidelity, surfacing critical edges such as malicious file interactions and anomalous netflows. The average explanation overhead is 3-5 seconds per event. By providing insight into the model's reasoning, our framework aims to improve analyst trust and triage speed.</description>

      <title>When Does Learning Renormalize? Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.
  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.</description>

      <title>LLaViDA: A Large Language Vision Driving Assistant for Explicit Reasoning and Enhanced Trajectory Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set. The code for this paper is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Stable and Efficient Single-Rollout RL for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Breaking Minds, Breaking Systems: Jailbreaking Large Language Models via Human-like Psychological Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained considerable popularity and protected by increasingly sophisticated safety mechanisms. However, jailbreak attacks continue to pose a critical security threat by inducing models to generate policy-violating behaviors. Current paradigms focus on input-level anomalies, overlooking that the model's internal psychometric state can be systematically manipulated. To address this, we introduce Psychological Jailbreak, a new jailbreak attack paradigm that exposes a stateful psychological attack surface in LLMs, where attackers exploit the manipulation of a model's psychological state across interactions. Building on this insight, we propose Human-like Psychological Manipulation (HPM), a black-box jailbreak method that dynamically profiles a target model's latent psychological vulnerabilities and synthesizes tailored multi-turn attack strategies. By leveraging the model's optimization for anthropomorphic consistency, HPM creates a psychological pressure where social compliance overrides safety constraints. To systematically measure psychological safety, we construct an evaluation framework incorporating psychometric datasets and the Policy Corruption Score (PCS). Benchmarking against various models (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-2-Flash), HPM achieves a mean Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 88.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art attack baselines. Our experiments demonstrate robust penetration against advanced defenses, including adversarial prompt optimization (e.g., RPO) and cognitive interventions (e.g., Self-Reminder). Ultimately, PCS analysis confirms HPM induces safety breakdown to satisfy manipulated contexts. Our work advocates for a fundamental paradigm shift from static content filtering to psychological safety, prioritizing the development of psychological defense mechanisms against deep cognitive manipulation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Discrepancy and Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Learning for Object Detection in Hyperspectral Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images with high spectral resolution provide new insights into recognizing subtle differences in similar substances. However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{D}iscrepancy and \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features. Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with other ones.</description>

      <title>Offline Behavioral Data Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a widely adopted approach for offline policy learning from expert demonstrations. However, the large scale of offline behavioral datasets often results in computationally intensive training when used in downstream tasks. In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data.</description>

      <title>Towards Ancient Plant Seed Classification: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dietary preferences of ancient societies and their evolution across periods and regions is crucial for revealing human-environment interactions. Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key "evidence" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%. This demonstrates that our work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research.</description>

      <title>Software Vulnerability Management in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: An Industry Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, particularly by automating repetitive tasks and improving developer productivity. While these advancements are well-documented, the use of AI-powered tools for Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), such as vulnerability detection and repair, remains underexplored in industry settings. To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent. We observe a socio-technical adoption pattern in which AI outputs are filtered through human oversight and organizational governance. To support safe and effective use of AI for SVM, we recommend improvements in explainability, contextual awareness, integration workflows, and validation practices. We assert that these findings can offer practical guidance for practitioners, tool developers, and researchers seeking to enhance secure software development through the use of AI.</description>

      <title>TICL+: A Case Study On Speech In-Context Learning for Children's Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Children's speech recognition remains challenging due to substantial acoustic and linguistic variability, limited labeled data, and significant differences from adult speech. Speech foundation models can address these challenges through Speech In-Context Learning (SICL), allowing adaptation to new domains without fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of SICL depends on how in-context examples are selected. We extend an existing retrieval-based method, Text-Embedding KNN for SICL (TICL), introducing an acoustic reranking step to create TICL+. This extension prioritizes examples that are both semantically and acoustically aligned with the test input. Experiments on four children's speech corpora show that TICL+ achieves up to a 53.3% relative word error rate reduction over zero-shot performance and 37.6% over baseline TICL, highlighting the value of combining semantic and acoustic information for robust, scalable ASR in children's speech.</description>

      <title>Who Can See Through You? Adversarial Shielding Against VLM-Based Attribute Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become widely adopted, VLM-based attribute inference attacks have emerged as a serious privacy concern, enabling adversaries to infer private attributes from images shared on social media. This escalating threat calls for dedicated protection methods to safeguard user privacy. However, existing methods often degrade the visual quality of images or interfere with vision-based functions on social media, thereby failing to achieve a desirable balance between privacy protection and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary BP+OSD Decoding for Low-Latency Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an evolutionary belief propagation (EBP) decoder for quantum error correction, which incorporates trainable weights into the BP algorithm and optimizes them via the differential evolution algorithm. This approach enables end-to-end optimization of the EBP combined with ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Experimental results on surface codes and quantum low-density parity-check codes show that EBP+OSD achieves better decoding performance and lower computational complexity than BP+OSD, particularly under strict low latency constraints (within 5 BP iterations).</description>

      <title>AL-GNN: Privacy-Preserving and Replay-Free Continual Graph Learning via Analytic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual graph learning (CGL) aims to enable graph neural networks to incrementally learn from a stream of graph structured data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design.</description>

      <title>Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence via Differentiable Internal Alignment Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence (ESAI), a theoretical framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that embeds alignment constraints directly into agents internal representations using differentiable internal alignment embeddings. Unlike external reward shaping or post-hoc safety constraints, internal alignment embeddings are learned latent variables that predict externalized harm through counterfactual reasoning and modulate policy updates toward harm reduction through attention and graph-based propagation.
  The ESAI framework integrates four mechanisms: differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties computed from soft reference distributions, alignment-weighted perceptual attention, Hebbian associative memory supporting temporal credit assignment, and similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.
  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems. We identify open theoretical questions regarding convergence guarantees, embedding dimensionality, and extension to high-dimensional environments. Empirical evaluation is left to future work.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Adjustment for Micro Causal Effects in Summary Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18315v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational studies in fields such as epidemiology often rely on covariate adjustment to estimate causal effects. Classical graphical criteria, like the back-door criterion and the generalized adjustment criterion, are powerful tools for identifying valid adjustment sets in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, these criteria are not directly applicable to summary causal graphs (SCGs), which are abstractions of DAGs commonly used in dynamic systems. In SCGs, each node typically represents an entire time series and may involve cycles, making classical criteria inapplicable for identifying causal effects. Recent work established complete conditions for determining whether the micro causal effect of a treatment or an exposure $X_{t-\gamma}$ on an outcome $Y_t$ is identifiable via covariate adjustment in SCGs, under the assumption of no hidden confounding. However, these identifiability conditions have two main limitations. First, they are complex, relying on cumbersome definitions and requiring the enumeration of multiple paths in the SCG, which can be computationally expensive. Second, when these conditions are satisfied, they only provide two valid adjustment sets, limiting flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an equivalent but simpler formulation of those identifiability conditions and introduce a new criterion that identifies a broader class of valid adjustment sets in SCGs. Additionally, we characterize the quasi-optimal adjustment set among these, i.e., the one that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the causal effect estimator. Our contributions offer both theoretical advancement and practical tools for more flexible and efficient causal inference in abstracted causal graphs.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy and Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Energy-Efficient Process Control: A Use Case in Industrial Compressed Air Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy reinforcement learning approach for the control of industrial compressed air systems. We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\,\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism for Real-Time Multilingual Lip Synchronization in Video Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a parallel and asynchronous Transformer framework designed for efficient and accurate multilingual lip synchronization in real-time video conferencing systems. The proposed architecture integrates translation, speech processing, and lip-synchronization modules within a pipeline-parallel design that enables concurrent module execution through message-queue-based decoupling, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches. To enhance computational efficiency and throughput, the inference workflow of each module is optimized through low-level graph compilation, mixed-precision quantization, and hardware-accelerated kernel fusion. These optimizations provide substantial gains in efficiency while preserving model accuracy and visual quality. In addition, a context-adaptive silence-detection component segments the input speech stream at semantically coherent boundaries, improving translation consistency and temporal alignment across languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel architecture outperforms conventional sequential pipelines in processing speed, synchronization stability, and resource utilization. The modular, message-oriented design makes this work applicable to resource-constrained IoT communication scenarios including telemedicine, multilingual kiosks, and remote assistance systems. Overall, this work advances the development of low-latency, resource-efficient multimodal communication frameworks for next-generation AIoT systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Position Control of a Quadrotor Using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control architecture for quadrotors. With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($\phi$) and Pitch ($\theta$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($\psi$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Entropy Tuning in Reinforcement Learning Low-Level Quadcopter Control: Stochasticity vs Determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dynamic entropy tuning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that train a stochastic policy. Its performance is compared against algorithms that train a deterministic one. Stochastic policies optimize a probability distribution over actions to maximize rewards, while deterministic policies select a single deterministic action per state. The effect of training a stochastic policy with both static entropy and dynamic entropy and then executing deterministic actions to control the quadcopter is explored. It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions. For the purpose of this research, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was chosen for the stochastic algorithm while the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) was chosen for the deterministic algorithm. The training and simulation results show the positive effect the dynamic entropy tuning has on controlling the quadcopter by preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving exploration efficiency.</description>

      <title>MCVI-SANet: A lightweight semi-supervised model for LAI and SPAD estimation of winter wheat under vegetation index saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vegetation index (VI) saturation during the dense canopy stage and limited ground-truth annotations of winter wheat constrain accurate estimation of LAI and SPAD. Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness. In addition, deep learning baselines suffer from domain gaps and high data demands, which restrict their generalization. Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters. Overall, the integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Few-Shot Early Rumor Detection with Imitation Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early Rumor Detection (EARD) aims to identify the earliest point at which a claim can be accurately classified based on a sequence of social media posts. This is especially challenging in data-scarce settings. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in few-shot NLP tasks, they are not well-suited for time-series data and are computationally expensive for both training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel EARD framework that combines an autonomous agent and an LLM-based detection model, where the agent acts as a reliable decision-maker for \textit{early time point determination}, while the LLM serves as a powerful \textit{rumor detector}. This approach offers the first solution for few-shot EARD, necessitating only the training of a lightweight agent and allowing the LLM to remain training-free. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our approach boosts performance across LLMs and surpasses existing EARD methods in accuracy and earliness.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel neurosymbolic framework for RDF-to-text generation, in which the model is "trained" through collaborative interactions among multiple LLM agents rather than traditional backpropagation. The LLM agents produce rule-based Python code for a generator for the given domain, based on RDF triples only, with no in-domain human reference texts. The resulting system is fully interpretable, requires no supervised training data, and generates text nearly instantaneously using only a single CPU. Our experiments on the WebNLG and OpenDialKG data show that outputs produced by our approach reduce hallucination, with only slight fluency penalties compared to finetuned or prompted language models</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key to success in automating prior art search in patent research using artificial intelligence lies in developing large datasets for machine learning and ensuring their availability. This work is dedicated to providing a comprehensive solution to the problem of creating infrastructure for research in this field, including datasets and tools for calculating search quality criteria. The paper discusses the concept of semantic clusters of patent documents that determine the state of the art in a given subject, as proposed by the authors. A definition of such semantic clusters is also provided. Prior art search is presented as the task of identifying elements within a semantic cluster of patent documents in the subject area specified by the document under consideration. A generator of user-configurable datasets for machine learning, based on collections of U.S. and Russian patent documents, is described. The dataset generator creates a database of links to documents in semantic clusters. Then, based on user-defined parameters, it forms a dataset of semantic clusters in JSON format for machine learning. To evaluate machine learning outcomes, it is proposed to calculate search quality scores that account for semantic clusters of the documents being searched. To automate the evaluation process, the paper describes a utility developed by the authors for assessing the quality of prior art document search.</description>

      <title>Exploration vs. Fixation: Scaffolding Divergent and Convergent Thinking for Human-AI Co-Creation with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has begun to democratize creative work, enabling novices to produce complex artifacts such as code, images, and videos. However, in practice, existing interaction paradigms often fail to support divergent exploration: users tend to converge too quickly on early ``good enough'' results and struggle to move beyond them, leading to premature convergence and design fixation that constrains their creative potential. To address this, we propose a structured, process-oriented human-AI co-creation paradigm including divergent and convergent thinking stages, grounded in Wallas's model of creativity. To avoid design fixation, our paradigm scaffolds both high-level exploration of conceptual ideas in the early divergent thinking phase and low-level exploration of variations in the later convergent thinking phrase. We instantiate this paradigm in HAIExplore, an image co-creation system that (i) scaffolds divergent thinking through a dedicated brainstorming stage for exploring high-level ideas in a conceptual space, and (ii) scaffolds convergent refinement through an interface that externalizes users' refinement intentions as interpretable parameters and options, making the refinement process more controllable and easier to explore. We report on a within-subjects study comparing HAIExplore with a widely used linear chat interface (ChatGPT) for creative image generation. Our findings show that explicitly scaffolding the creative process into brainstorming and refinement stages can mitigate design fixation, improve perceived controllability and alignment with users' intentions, and better support the non-linear nature of creative work. We conclude with design implications for future creativity support tools and human-AI co-creation workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.</description>

      <title>AraToken: Optimizing Arabic Tokenization with Normalization Pipeline and Language Extension for Qwen3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step for large language models (LLMs), directly impacting training efficiency and downstream performance. General-purpose tokenizers trained predominantly on English and Latin-script languages exhibit suboptimal performance on morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, resulting in inflated token sequences and reduced compression efficiency. In this work, we present AraToken, an Arabic-optimized tokenizer built on SentencePiece Unigram algorithm with a comprehensive normalization pipeline addressing Arabic-specific orthographic variations including Alif variants, diacritics, and Arabic-Indic numerals. We systematically compare BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece algorithms across multiple configurations, demonstrating that SentencePiece with normalization achieves 18% lower fertility (1.199 vs 1.35 tokens/word) compared to unnormalized baselines. Furthermore, we introduce the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP), a method for integrating the optimized tokenizer into Qwen3-0.6B through vocabulary extension with mean subtoken initialization and selective transformer layer unfreezing. Our experiments show that LEP reduces evaluation loss from 8.28 to 2.43 within 800 training steps on 100K Arabic samples. We release our tokenizer, training scripts, and model checkpoints to facilitate Arabic NLP research.</description>

      <title>AmPLe: Supporting Vision-Language Models via Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble Multi-Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-prompt learning methods have emerged as an effective approach for facilitating the rapid adaptation of vision-language models to downstream tasks with limited resources. Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Based Decentralized Adaptive Intelligent Transmission Protocol for Privacy Preserving 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The move to 6th Generation (6G) wireless networks creates new issues with privacy, scalability, and adaptability. The data-intensive nature of 6G is not handled well by older, centralized network models. A shift toward more secure and decentralized systems is therefore required. A new framework called the Federated Learning-based Decentralized Adaptive Intelligent Transmission Protocol (AITP) is proposed to meet these challenges. The AITP uses the distributed learning of Federated Learning (FL) within a decentralized system. Transmission parameters can be adjusted intelligently in real time. User privacy is maintained by keeping raw data on local edge devices. The protocol's performance was evaluated with mathematical modeling and detailed simulations. It was shown to be superior to traditional non-adaptive and centralized AI methods across several key metrics. These included latency, network throughput, energy efficiency, and robustness. The AITP is presented as a foundational technology for future 6G networks that supports a user-centric, privacy-first design. This study is a step forward for privacy-preserving research in 6G.</description>

      <title>VeruSAGE: A Study of Agent-Based Verification for Rust Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability to understand and develop code. However, their capability to rigorously reason about and prove code correctness remains in question. This paper offers a comprehensive study of LLMs' capability to develop correctness proofs for system software written in Rust. We curate a new system-verification benchmark suite, VeruSAGE-Bench, which consists of 849 proof tasks extracted from eight open-source Verus-verified Rust systems. Furthermore, we design different agent systems to match the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs (o4-mini, GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 4.5). Our study shows that different tools and agent settings are needed to stimulate the system-verification capability of different types of LLMs. The best LLM-agent combination in our study completes over 80% of system-verification tasks in VeruSAGE-Bench. It also completes over 90% of a set of system proof tasks not part of VeruSAGE-Bench because they had not yet been finished by human experts. This result shows the great potential for LLM-assisted development of verified system software.</description>

      <title>MeniMV: A Multi-view Benchmark for Meniscus Injury Severity Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise grading of meniscal horn tears is critical in knee injury diagnosis but remains underexplored in automated MRI analysis. Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Notably, MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of MeniMV, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models. Our extensive experiments establish strong baselines and highlight challenges in severity grading, providing a valuable foundation for future research in automated musculoskeletal imaging.</description>

      <title>An Agentic AI Framework for Training General Practitioner Student Skills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models offer strong potential for enhancing virtual simulated patients (VSPs) in medical education by providing scalable alternatives to resource-intensive traditional methods. However, current VSPs often struggle with medical accuracy, consistent roleplaying, scenario generation for VSP use, and educationally structured feedback. We introduce an agentic framework for training general practitioner student skills that unifies (i) configurable, evidence-based vignette generation, (ii) controlled persona-driven patient dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and (iii) standards-based assessment and feedback for both communication and clinical reasoning. We instantiate the framework in an interactive spoken consultation setting and evaluate it with medical students ($\mathbf{N{=}14}$). Participants reported realistic and vignette-faithful dialogue, appropriate difficulty calibration, a stable personality signal, and highly useful example-rich feedback, alongside excellent overall usability. These results support agentic separation of scenario control, interaction control, and standards-based assessment as a practical pattern for building dependable and pedagogically valuable VSP training tools.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</description>

      <title>Snowveil: A Framework for Decentralised Preference Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregating subjective preferences of a large group is a fundamental challenge in computational social choice, traditionally reliant on central authorities. To address the limitations of this model, this paper introduces Decentralised Preference Discovery (DPD), the problem of determining the collective will of an electorate under constraints of censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication. We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis through extensive simulation, validating Snowveil's $O(n)$ scalability. Overall, this work advances the understanding of how a stable consensus can emerge from subjective, complex, and diverse preferences in decentralised systems for large electorates.</description>

      <title>Secret mixtures of experts inside your LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being one of the earliest neural network layers, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is arguably one of the least understood parts of the transformer architecture due to its dense computation and lack of easy visualization. This paper seeks to understand the MLP layers in dense LLM models by hypothesizing that these layers secretly approximately perform a sparse computation -- namely, that they can be well approximated by sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.
  Our hypothesis is based on a novel theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) structure in activation space. We empirically validate the hypothesis on pretrained LLMs, and demonstrate that the activation distribution matters -- these results do not hold for Gaussian data, but rather rely crucially on structure in the distribution of neural network activations.
  Our results shine light on a general principle at play in MLP layers inside LLMs, and give an explanation for the effectiveness of modern MoE-based transformers. Additionally, our experimental explorations suggest new directions for more efficient MoE architecture design based on low-rank routers.</description>

      <title>SoK: Understanding (New) Security Issues Across AI4Code Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-for-Code (AI4Code) systems are reshaping software engineering, with tools like GitHub Copilot accelerating code generation, translation, and vulnerability detection. Alongside these advances, however, security risks remain pervasive: insecure outputs, biased benchmarks, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation undermine their reliability. This SoK surveys the landscape of AI4Code security across three core applications, identifying recurring gaps: benchmark dominance by Python and toy problems, lack of standardized security datasets, data leakage in evaluation, and fragile adversarial robustness. A comparative study of six state-of-the-art models illustrates these challenges: insecure patterns persist in code generation, vulnerability detection is brittle to semantic-preserving attacks, fine-tuning often misaligns security objectives, and code translation yields uneven security benefits. From this analysis, we distill three forward paths: embedding secure-by-default practices in code generation, building robust and comprehensive detection benchmarks, and leveraging translation as a route to security-enhanced languages. We call for a shift toward security-first AI4Code, where vulnerability mitigation and robustness are embedded throughout the development life cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) models frequently rely on spurious correlations rather than semantic reasoning. Existing mitigation strategies often incur high annotation costs or trigger catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. We propose an automated, scalable pipeline to address these limitations. First, we introduce Log-Frequency LMI (LF-LMI) to accurately detect semantic artifacts. Second, we generate a high-quality synthetic contrast set via an LLM-synthesis pipeline with multi-judge verification. Finally, we introduce Dynamic Balanced Sampling, a training strategy that rotates the original data distribution to prevent forgetting. Our method improves consistency on a challenging benchmark from 63.5% to 81.0% while maintaining 88.4% in-domain accuracy, significantly outperforming naive fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing maps for water quality assessment in reservoirs and lakes: A systematic literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sustainable water quality underpins ecological balance and water security. Assessing and managing lakes and reservoirs is difficult due to data sparsity, heterogeneity, and nonlinear relationships among parameters. This review examines how Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised AI technique, is applied to water quality assessment. It synthesizes research on parameter selection, spatial and temporal sampling strategies, and clustering approaches. Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators. This review highlights SOMs versatility in ecological assessments, trophic state classification, algal bloom monitoring, and catchment area impact evaluations. The findings offer comprehensive insights into existing methodologies, supporting future research and practical applications aimed at improving the monitoring and sustainable management of lake and reservoir ecosystems.</description>

      <title>SWE-EVO: Benchmarking Coding Agents in Long-Horizon Software Evolution Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Decision-Making in Windows PE Malware Classification During Dataset Shifts with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques have achieved strong performance in classifying Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware, but their reliability often degrades under dataset shifts, leading to misclassifications with severe security consequences. To address this, we enhance an existing LightGBM (LGBM) malware detector by integrating Neural Networks (NN), PriorNet, and Neural Network Ensembles, evaluated across three benchmark datasets: EMBER, BODMAS, and UCSB. The UCSB dataset, composed mainly of packed malware, introduces a substantial distributional shift relative to EMBER and BODMAS, making it a challenging testbed for robustness. We study uncertainty-aware decision strategies, including probability thresholding, PriorNet, ensemble-derived estimates, and Inductive Conformal Evaluation (ICE). Our main contribution is the use of ensemble-based uncertainty estimates as Non-Conformity Measures within ICE, combined with a novel threshold optimisation method. On the UCSB dataset, where the shift is most severe, the state-of-the-art probability-based ICE (SOTA) yields an incorrect acceptance rate (IA%) of 22.8%. In contrast, our method reduces this to 16% a relative reduction of about 30% while maintaining competitive correct acceptance rates (CA%). These results demonstrate that integrating ensemble-based uncertainty with conformal prediction provides a more reliable safeguard against misclassifications under extreme dataset shifts, particularly in the presence of packed malware, thereby offering practical benefits for real-world security operations.</description>

      <title>PlantDiseaseNet-RT50: A Fine-tuned ResNet50 Architecture for High-Accuracy Plant Disease Detection Beyond Standard CNNs</title>

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity and global food security, accounting for 70-80% of crop losses worldwide. Traditional detection methods rely heavily on expert visual inspection, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often impractical for large-scale farming operations. In this paper, we present PlantDiseaseNet-RT50, a novel fine-tuned deep learning architecture based on ResNet50 for automated plant disease detection. Our model features strategically unfrozen layers, a custom classification head with regularization mechanisms, and dynamic learning rate scheduling through cosine decay. Using a comprehensive dataset of distinct plant disease categories across multiple crop species, PlantDiseaseNet-RT50 achieves exceptional performance with approximately 98% accuracy, precision, and recall. Our architectural modifications and optimization protocol demonstrate how targeted fine-tuning can transform a standard pretrained model into a specialized agricultural diagnostic tool. We provide a detailed account of our methodology, including the systematic unfreezing of terminal layers, implementation of batch normalization and dropout regularization and application of advanced training techniques. PlantDiseaseNet-RT50 represents a significant advancement in AI-driven agricultural tools, offering a computationally efficient solution for rapid and accurate plant disease diagnosis that can be readily implemented in practical farming contexts to support timely interventions and reduce crop losses.</description>

      <title>GTMA: Dynamic Representation Optimization for OOD Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle in open-world applications, where out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts often trigger cross-modal alignment collapse and severely degrade zero-shot performance. We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.
  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.
  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of pseudo-word optimization.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Consistency: Selection-Induced Bias in Gated Kalman Innovation Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.</description>

      <title>Prediction and Forecast of Short-Term Drought Impacts Using Machine Learning to Support Mitigation and Adaptation Efforts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drought is a complex natural hazard that affects ecological and human systems, often resulting in substantial environmental and economic losses. Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>A Formal Descriptive Language for Learning Dynamics: A Five-Layer Structural Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding learning as a dynamic process is challenging due to the interaction of multiple factors, including cognitive load, internal state change, and subjective evaluation. Existing approaches often address these elements in isolation, limiting the ability to describe learning phenomena within a unified and structurally explicit framework. This paper proposes a multi-layer formal descriptive framework for learning dynamics. Rather than offering a predictive or prescriptive model, the framework introduces a symbolic language composed of state variables, mappings, and layer-specific responsibilities, enabling consistent description of learning processes without commitment to specific functional forms or optimization objectives. This descriptive framework is intended to serve as a structural substrate for analyzing learning processes in human learners, and by extension, in adaptive and Al-assisted learning systems. A central design principle is the explicit separation of descriptive responsibilities across layers, distinguishing load generation, internal understanding transformation, observation, and evaluation. Within this structure, cognitive load is treated as a relational quantity arising from interactions between external input and internal organization, while subjective evaluation is modeled as a minimal regulatory interface responding to learning dynamics and environmental conditions. By emphasizing descriptive clarity and extensibility, the framework provides a common language for organizing existing theories and supporting future empirical and theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Detection of AI Generated Images Using Combined Uncertainty Measures and Particle Swarm Optimised Rejection Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI-generated images become increasingly photorealistic, distinguishing them from natural images poses a growing challenge. This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection.</description>

      <title>SecureCode v2.0: A Production-Grade Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI assistants produce vulnerable code in 45% of security-relevant scenarios, introducing flaws into production systems at scale. Yet existing secure coding datasets fall short. They lack incident grounding, don't provide the scale modern training requires, and miss the operational security context developers need for production deployments. We present SecureCode v2.0, a production-grade dataset of 1,215 security-focused coding examples that passed structural validation and expert security review. Every example ties to actual documented security incidents with CVE references, provides vulnerable and secure implementations, demonstrates concrete attacks, and includes defense-in-depth operational guidance. The dataset covers 11 vulnerability categories (complete OWASP Top 10:2025 plus AI/ML Security Threats) across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and YAML for infrastructure-as-code).
  Our quality assurance framework ensures complete incident grounding. Each example includes SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations (Docker, AppArmor, WAF configurations), and testing approaches using language-appropriate frameworks. The dataset uses a 4-turn conversational structure mirroring actual developer-AI interactions, escalating from basic implementations to advanced security considerations and defense-in-depth guidance.
  Our contributions: (1) 1,215 rigorously validated examples split into 989 training, 122 validation, and 104 test sets, (2) an automated validation framework ensuring dataset consistency, (3) a 4-turn conversational structure capturing realistic security workflows, (4) comprehensive operational security guidance with SIEM integration strategies, (5) complete language-specific implementation fidelity, and (6) open-source release of data, validation tools, and benchmarking protocols.</description>

      <title>Toward Training Superintelligent Software Agents through Self-Play SWE-RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While current software agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) can boost programmer productivity, their training data (e.g., GitHub issues and pull requests) and environments (e.g., pass-to-pass and fail-to-pass tests) heavily depend on human knowledge or curation, posing a fundamental barrier to superintelligence. In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Medical Large Vision-Language Models via Alignment Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promising results in clinical applications, but often suffer from hallucinated outputs due to misaligned visual understanding. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations contributing to this issue: insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment. To address these problems, we propose MEDALIGN, a simple, lightweight alignment distillation framework that transfers visual alignment knowledge from a domain-specific Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to Med-LVLMs. MEDALIGN introduces two distillation losses: a spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and an attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions. Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks show that MEDALIGN consistently improves both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Accountability in Networked MAS: Tracing and Mitigating Emergent Norms at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale networked multi-agent systems increasingly underpin critical infrastructure, yet their collective behavior can drift toward undesirable emergent norms that elude conventional governance mechanisms. We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline. These results demonstrate that a theoretically principled accountability layer can induce ethically aligned, self-regulating behavior in complex MAS without sacrificing performance or scalability.</description>

      <title>AI Code in the Wild: Measuring Security Risks and Ecosystem Shifts of AI-Generated Code in Modern Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code generation are becoming integral to modern software development, but their real-world prevalence and security impact remain poorly understood.
  We present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-generated code (AIGCode) in the wild. We build a high-precision detection pipeline and a representative benchmark to distinguish AIGCode from human-written code, and apply them to (i) development commits from the top 1,000 GitHub repositories (2022-2025) and (ii) 7,000+ recent CVE-linked code changes. This lets us label commits, files, and functions along a human/AI axis and trace how AIGCode moves through projects and vulnerability life cycles.
  Our measurements show three ecological patterns. First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured: AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written. Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting "AI-induced vulnerabilities" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers. Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories.
  We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.</description>

      <title>Placenta Accreta Spectrum Detection Using an MRI-based Hybrid CNN-Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a serious obstetric condition that can be challenging to diagnose with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) due to variability in radiologists' interpretations. To overcome this challenge, a hybrid 3D deep learning model for automated PAS detection from volumetric MRI scans is proposed in this study. The model integrates a 3D DenseNet121 to capture local features and a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) to model global spatial context. It was developed and evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 1,133 MRI volumes. Multiple 3D deep learning architectures were also evaluated for comparison. On an independent test set, the DenseNet121-ViT model achieved the highest performance with a five-run average accuracy of 84.3%. These results highlight the strength of hybrid CNN-Transformer models as a computer-aided diagnosis tool. The model's performance demonstrates a clear potential to assist radiologists by providing a robust decision support to improve diagnostic consistency across interpretations, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and timeliness of PAS diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Modality-Dependent Memory Mechanisms in Cross-Modal Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory-augmented spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, yet their generalization across sensory modalities remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive cross-modal ablation study of memory mechanisms in SNNs, evaluating Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs), and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) across visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) neuromorphic datasets. Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap). These findings establish that memory mechanisms exhibit task-specific benefits rather than universal applicability. Joint multi-modal training with HGRN achieves 94.41% visual and 79.37% audio accuracy (88.78% average), matching parallel HGRN performance through unified deployment. Quantitative engram analysis confirms weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity), validating our parallel architecture design. Our work provides the first empirical evidence for modality-specific memory optimization in neuromorphic systems, achieving 603x energy efficiency over traditional neural networks.</description>

      <title>From Scratch to Fine-Tuned: A Comparative Study of Transformer Training Strategies for Legal Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multilingual nations like India, access to legal information is often hindered by language barriers, as much of the legal and judicial documentation remains in English. Legal Machine Translation (L-MT) offers a scalable solution to this challenge by enabling accurate and accessible translations of legal documents. This paper presents our work for the JUST-NLP 2025 Legal MT shared task, focusing on English-Hindi translation using Transformer-based approaches. We experiment with 2 complementary strategies, fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch using the provided legal corpus. Performance is evaluated using standard MT metrics, including SacreBLEU, chrF++, TER, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and COMET. Our fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieves a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, significantly outperforming both baseline and from-scratch models. The results highlight the effectiveness of domain adaptation in enhancing translation quality and demonstrate the potential of L-MT systems to improve access to justice and legal transparency in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>The Interaction Bottleneck of Deep Neural Networks: Discovery, Proof, and Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding what kinds of cooperative structures deep neural networks (DNNs) can represent remains a fundamental yet insufficiently understood problem. In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations.</description>

      <title>Text2Graph VPR: A Text-to-Graph Expert System for Explainable Place Recognition in Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in long-term deployment requires reasoning beyond pixel similarity: systems must make transparent, interpretable decisions that remain robust under lighting, weather and seasonal change. We present Text2Graph VPR, an explainable semantic localization system that converts image sequences into textual scene descriptions, parses those descriptions into structured scene graphs, and reasons over the resulting graphs to identify places. Scene graphs capture objects, attributes and pairwise relations; we aggregate per-frame graphs into a compact place representation and perform retrieval with a dual-similarity mechanism that fuses learned Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings and a Shortest-Path (SP) kernel for structural matching. This hybrid design enables both learned semantic matching and topology-aware comparison, and -- critically -- produces human-readable intermediate representations that support diagnostic analysis and improve transparency in the decision process. We validate the system on Oxford RobotCar and MSLS (Amman/San Francisco) benchmarks and demonstrate robust retrieval under severe appearance shifts, along with zero-shot operation using human textual queries. The results illustrate that semantic, graph-based reasoning is a viable and interpretable alternative for place recognition, particularly suited to safety-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>PTTA: A Pure Text-to-Animation Framework for High-Quality Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional animation production involves complex pipelines and significant manual labor cost. While recent video generation models such as Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX achieve impressive results on natural video synthesis, they exhibit notable limitations when applied to animation generation. Recent efforts, such as AniSora, demonstrate promising performance by fine-tuning image-to-video models for animation styles, yet analogous exploration in the text-to-video setting remains limited.
  In this work, we present PTTA, a pure text-to-animation framework for high-quality animation creation. We first construct a small-scale but high-quality paired dataset of animation videos and textual descriptions. Building upon the pretrained text-to-video model HunyuanVideo, we perform fine-tuning to adapt it to animation-style generation. Extensive visual evaluations across multiple dimensions show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms comparable baselines in animation video synthesis.</description>

      <title>DASH: Deception-Augmented Shared Mental Model for a Human-Machine Teaming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DASH (Deception-Augmented Shared mental model for Human-machine teaming), a novel framework that enhances mission resilience by embedding proactive deception into Shared Mental Models (SMM). Designed for mission-critical applications such as surveillance and rescue, DASH introduces "bait tasks" to detect insider threats, e.g., compromised Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), AI agents, or human analysts, before they degrade team performance. Upon detection, tailored recovery mechanisms are activated, including UGV system reinstallation, AI model retraining, or human analyst replacement. In contrast to existing SMM approaches that neglect insider risks, DASH improves both coordination and security. Empirical evaluations across four schemes (DASH, SMM-only, no-SMM, and baseline) show that DASH sustains approximately 80% mission success under high attack rates, eight times higher than the baseline. This work contributes a practical human-AI teaming framework grounded in shared mental models, a deception-based strategy for insider threat detection, and empirical evidence of enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions. DASH establishes a foundation for secure, adaptive human-machine teaming in contested environments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Text2SQL Framework using Small Language Models and Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text2SQL, the task of generating SQL queries from natural language text, is a critical challenge in data engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance for this task due to their advanced comprehension and generation capabilities. However, privacy and cost considerations prevent companies from using Text2SQL solutions based on external LLMs offered as a service. Rather, small LLMs (SLMs) that are openly available and can hosted in-house are adopted. These SLMs, in turn, lack the generalization capabilities of larger LLMs, which impairs their effectiveness for complex tasks such as Text2SQL. To address these limitations, we propose MATS, a novel Text2SQL framework designed specifically for SLMs. MATS uses a multi-agent mechanism that assigns specialized roles to auxiliary agents, reducing individual workloads and fostering interaction. A training scheme based on reinforcement learning aligns these agents using feedback obtained during execution, thereby maintaining competitive performance despite a limited LLM size. Evaluation results using on benchmark datasets show that MATS, deployed on a single- GPU server, yields accuracy that are on-par with large-scale LLMs when using significantly fewer parameters. Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/thanhdath/mats-sql.</description>

      <title>LLM-CAS: Dynamic Neuron Perturbation for Real-Time Hallucination Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinated content that lacks factual or contextual grounding, limiting their reliability in critical applications. Existing approaches such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback are data intensive and computationally expensive, while static parameter editing methods struggle with context dependent errors and catastrophic forgetting.
  We propose LLM-CAS, a framework that formulates real-time hallucination correction as a hierarchical reinforcement learning problem. LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context. Unlike prior dynamic approaches that rely on heuristic or predefined adjustments, this policy driven mechanism enables adaptive and fine grained correction without permanent parameter modification.
  Experiments across multiple language models demonstrate that LLM-CAS consistently improves factual accuracy, achieving gains of 10.98 percentage points on StoryCloze, 2.71 points on TriviaQA, and 2.06 points on the MC1 score of TruthfulQA. These results outperform both static editing methods such as ITI and CAA and the dynamic SADI framework. Overall, LLM-CAS provides an efficient and context aware solution for improving the reliability of LLMs, with promising potential for future multimodal extensions.</description>

      <title>ARC: Leveraging Compositional Representations for Cross-Problem Learning on VRPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) with diverse real-world attributes have driven recent interest in cross-problem learning approaches that efficiently generalize across problem variants. We propose ARC (Attribute Representation via Compositional Learning), a cross-problem learning framework that learns disentangled attribute representations by decomposing them into two complementary components: an Intrinsic Attribute Embedding (IAE) for invariant attribute semantics and a Contextual Interaction Embedding (CIE) for attribute-combination effects. This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations. ARC achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Photometric Event-based 3D Gaussian Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer a high temporal resolution over traditional frame-based cameras, which makes them suitable for motion and structure estimation. However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>Remoe: Towards Efficient and Low-Cost MoE Inference in Serverless Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Multiscale Features Via Centralized Sparse-attention Network for EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal decoding is a key technology that translates brain activity into executable commands, laying the foundation for direct brain-machine interfacing and intelligent interaction. To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

      <title>CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Fine-Grained Safeguarding of LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Bi-Level Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. As MAS become increasingly autonomous in various safety-critical tasks, detecting malicious agents has become a critical security concern. Although existing graph anomaly detection (GAD)-based defenses can identify anomalous agents, they mainly rely on coarse sentence-level information and overlook fine-grained lexical cues, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in these methods limits their reliability and real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose XG-Guard, an explainable and fine-grained safeguarding framework for detecting malicious agents in MAS. To incorporate both coarse and fine-grained textual information for anomalous agent identification, we utilize a bi-level agent encoder to jointly model the sentence- and token-level representations of each agent. A theme-based anomaly detector further captures the evolving discussion focus in MAS dialogues, while a bi-level score fusion mechanism quantifies token-level contributions for explanation. Extensive experiments across diverse MAS topologies and attack scenarios demonstrate robust detection performance and strong interpretability of XG-Guard.</description>

      <title>$M^3-Verse$: A "Spot the Difference" Challenge for Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated extraordinary ability in static image and single-state spatial-temporal understanding. However, their capacity to comprehend the dynamic changes of objects within a shared spatial context between two distinct video observations, remains largely unexplored. This ability to reason about transformations within a consistent environment is particularly crucial for advancements in the field of spatial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce $M^3-Verse$, a Multi-Modal, Multi-State, Multi-Dimensional benchmark, to formally evaluate this capability. It is built upon paired videos that provide multi-perspective observations of an indoor scene before and after a state change. The benchmark contains a total of 270 scenes and 2,932 questions, which are categorized into over 50 subtasks that probe 4 core capabilities. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art LMMs and observe their limitations in tracking state transitions. To address these challenges, we further propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves significant performance improvements in multi-state perception. $M^3-Verse$ thus provides a challenging new testbed to catalyze the development of next-generation models with a more holistic understanding of our dynamic visual world.

      <title>PIPCFR: Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of individual treatment effects (ITE) focuses on predicting the outcome changes that result from a change in treatment. A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>IPCV: Information-Preserving Compression for MLLM Visual Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver strong vision-language performance but at high computational cost, driven by numerous visual tokens processed by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder. Existing token pruning strategies are inadequate: LLM-stage token pruning overlooks the ViT's overhead, while conventional ViT token pruning, without language guidance, risks discarding textually critical visual cues and introduces feature distortions amplified by the ViT's bidirectional attention. To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

      <title>Code2Doc: A Quality-First Curated Dataset for Code Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of automatic code documentation generation models depends critically on the quality of the training data used for supervision. However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation.
  We introduce \textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints.
  We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size. We release both the dataset and the full curation pipeline to support reproducible research on automatic code documentation generation.</description>

      <title>Smark: A Watermark for Text-to-Speech Diffusion Models via Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) diffusion models generate high-quality speech, which raises challenges for the model intellectual property protection and speech tracing for legal use. Audio watermarking is a promising solution. However, due to the structural differences among various TTS diffusion models, existing watermarking methods are often designed for a specific model and degrade audio quality, which limits their practical applicability. To address this dilemma, this paper proposes a universal watermarking scheme for TTS diffusion models, termed Smark. This is achieved by designing a lightweight watermark embedding framework that operates in the common reverse diffusion paradigm shared by all TTS diffusion models. To mitigate the impact on audio quality, Smark utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to embed watermarks into the relatively stable low-frequency regions of the audio, which ensures seamless watermark-audio integration and is resistant to removal during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the audio quality and watermark performance in various simulated real-world attack scenarios. The experimental results show that Smark achieves superior performance in both audio quality and watermark extraction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reliable Audio Deepfake Detection in Variable Conditions via Quantum-Kernel SVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic speech is challenging when labeled data are scarce and recording conditions vary. Existing end-to-end deep models often overfit or fail to generalize, and while kernel methods can remain competitive, their performance heavily depends on the chosen kernel. Here, we show that using a quantum kernel in audio deepfake detection reduces falsepositive rates without increasing model size. Quantum feature maps embed data into high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, enabling the use of expressive similarity measures and compact classifiers. Building on this motivation, we compare quantum-kernel SVMs (QSVMs) with classical SVMs using identical mel-spectrogram preprocessing and stratified 5-fold cross-validation across four corpora (ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 5 (2024), ADD23, and an In-the-Wild set). QSVMs achieve consistently lower equalerror rates (EER): 0.183 vs. 0.299 on ASVspoof 5 (2024), 0.081 vs. 0.188 on ADD23, 0.346 vs. 0.399 on ASVspoof 2019, and 0.355 vs. 0.413 In-the-Wild. At the EER operating point (where FPR equals FNR), these correspond to absolute false-positiverate reductions of 0.116 (38.8%), 0.107 (56.9%), 0.053 (13.3%), and 0.058 (14.0%), respectively. We also report how consistent the results are across cross-validation folds and margin-based measures of class separation, using identical settings for both models. The only modification is the kernel; the features and SVM remain unchanged, no additional trainable parameters are introduced, and the quantum kernel is computed on a conventional computer.</description>

      <title>FedVideoMAE: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Federated Video Moderation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of short-form video platforms increases the need for privacy-preserving moderation, as cloud-based pipelines expose raw videos to privacy risks, high bandwidth costs, and inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose an on-device federated learning framework for video violence detection that integrates self-supervised VideoMAE representations, LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation, and defense-in-depth privacy protection. Our approach reduces the trainable parameter count to 5.5M (~3.5% of a 156M backbone) and incorporates DP-SGD with configurable privacy budgets and secure aggregation. Experiments on RWF-2000 with 40 clients achieve 77.25% accuracy without privacy protection and 65-66% under strong differential privacy, while reducing communication cost by $28.3\times$ compared to full-model federated learning. The code is available at: {https://github.com/zyt-599/FedVideoMAE}</description>

      <title>Controllable Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Decomposition Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI weather prediction ensembles with latent noise injection and optimized with the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) have produced both accurate and well-calibrated predictions with far less computational cost compared with diffusion-based methods. However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications.</description>

Abstract: This survey reviews hyperbolic graph embedding models, and evaluate them on anomaly detection, highlighting their advantages over Euclidean methods in capturing complex structures. Evaluating models like \textit{HGCAE}, \textit{\(\mathcal{P}\)-VAE}, and \textit{HGCN} demonstrates high performance, with \textit{\(\mathcal{P}\)-VAE} achieving an F1-score of 94\% on the \textit{Elliptic} dataset and \textit{HGCAE} scoring 80\% on \textit{Cora}. In contrast, Euclidean methods like \textit{DOMINANT} and \textit{GraphSage} struggle with complex data. The study emphasizes the potential of hyperbolic spaces for improving anomaly detection, and provides an open-source library to foster further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Psychometric Validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale and a New Understanding of the Development of GenAI Mastery: Lessons from 3,932 Adult Brazilian Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18871v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems has introduced new forms of human-technology interaction, raising the question of whether sustained engagement gives rise to stable, internalized modes of cognition rather than merely transient efficiency gains. Grounded in the Cognitive Mediation Networks Theory, this study investigates Sophotechnic Mediation, a mode of thinking and acting associated with prolonged interaction with GenAI, and presents a comprehensive psychometric validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale. Data were collected between 2023 and 2025 from independent cross-sectional samples totaling 3,932 adult workers from public and private organizations in the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco, Brazil. Results indicate excellent internal consistency, a robust unidimensional structure, and measurement invariance across cohorts. Ordinal-robust confirmatory factor analyses and residual diagnostics show that elevated absolute fit indices reflect minor local dependencies rather than incorrect dimensionality. Distributional analyses reveal a time-evolving pattern characterized by a declining mass of non-adopters and convergence toward approximate Gaussianity among adopters, with model comparisons favoring a two-process hurdle model over a censored Gaussian specification. Sophotechnic Mediation is empirically distinct from Hypercultural mediation and is primarily driven by cumulative GenAI experience, with age moderating the rate of initial acquisition and the depth of later integration. Together, the findings support Sophotechnia as a coherent, measurable, and emergent mode of cognitive mediation associated with the ongoing GenAI revolution.</description>

      <title>CrashChat: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Multitask Traffic Crash Video Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating crash video analysis is essential to leverage the growing availability of driving video data for traffic safety research and accountability attribution in autonomous driving. Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation. The dataset and implementation code for CrashChat are available at https://github.com/Liangkd/CrashChat.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Estimate Student Struggles? Human-AI Difficulty Alignment with Proficiency Simulation for Item Difficulty Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of item (question or task) difficulty is critical for educational assessment but suffers from the cold start problem. While Large Language Models demonstrate superhuman problem-solving capabilities, it remains an open question whether they can perceive the cognitive struggles of human learners. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations. These results suggest that general problem-solving capability does not imply an understanding of human cognitive struggles, highlighting the challenge of using current models for automated difficulty prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to formulating and solving heterogeneous agent models with aggregate risk. We replace the cross-sectional distribution with low-dimensional prices as state variables and let agents learn equilibrium price dynamics directly from simulated paths. To do so, we introduce a structural reinforcement learning (SRL) method which treats prices via simulation while exploiting agents' structural knowledge of their own individual dynamics. Our SRL method yields a general and highly efficient global solution method for heterogeneous agent models that sidesteps the Master equation and handles problems traditional methods struggle with, in particular nontrivial market-clearing conditions. We illustrate the approach in the Krusell-Smith model, the Huggett model with aggregate shocks, and a HANK model with a forward-looking Phillips curve, all of which we solve globally within minutes.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Developer-Provided Context for AI Coding Assistants in Open-Source Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.</description>

      <title>LouvreSAE: Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable and Controllable Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artistic style transfer in generative models remains a significant challenge, as existing methods often introduce style only via model fine-tuning, additional adapters, or prompt engineering, all of which can be computationally expensive and may still entangle style with subject matter. In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: 8-bit Quantization Improves Continual Learning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting poses a fundamental challenge in continual learning, particularly when models are quantized for deployment efficiency. We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Procedural Memory for LLM Agents through Bayesian Selection and Contrastive Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MACLA, a framework that decouples reasoning from learning by maintaining a frozen large language model while performing all adaptation in an external hierarchical procedural memory. MACLA extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability via Bayesian posteriors, selects actions through expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures. Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 percent average performance, outperforming all baselines. On ALFWorld unseen tasks, MACLA reaches 90.3 percent with 3.1 percent positive generalization. The system constructs memory in 56 seconds, 2800 times faster than the state-of-the-art LLM parameter-training baseline, compressing 2851 trajectories into 187 procedures. Experimental results demonstrate that structured external memory with Bayesian selection and contrastive refinement enables sample-efficient, interpretable, and continually improving agents without LLM parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention with State-Object Weighted Combination for Compositional Zero Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object recognition has become prevalent across various industries. However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>R-GenIMA: Integrating Neuroimaging and Genetics with Interpretable Multimodal AI for Alzheimer's Disease Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires models capable of integrating macro-scale neuroanatomical alterations with micro-scale genetic susceptibility, yet existing multimodal approaches struggle to align these heterogeneous signals. We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>ICP-4D: Bridging Iterative Closest Point and LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominant paradigms for 4D LiDAR panoptic segmentation are usually required to train deep neural networks with large superimposed point clouds or design dedicated modules for instance association. However, these approaches perform redundant point processing and consequently become computationally expensive, yet still overlook the rich geometric priors inherently provided by raw point clouds. To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching. Our extensive experiments across both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, even without additional training or extra point cloud inputs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Challenges of LLMs in Real-world Medical Follow-up: A Comparative Study and An Optimized Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When applied directly in an end-to-end manner to medical follow-up tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from uncontrolled dialog flow and inaccurate information extraction due to the complexity of follow-up forms. To address this limitation, we designed and compared two follow-up chatbot systems: an end-to-end LLM-based system (control group) and a modular pipeline with structured process control (experimental group). Experimental results show that while the end-to-end approach frequently fails on lengthy and complex forms, our modular method-built on task decomposition, semantic clustering, and flow management-substantially improves dialog stability and extraction accuracy. Moreover, it reduces the number of dialogue turns by 46.73% and lowers token consumption by 80% to 87.5%. These findings highlight the necessity of integrating external control mechanisms when deploying LLMs in high-stakes medical follow-up scenarios.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Initialization for Reducing Generative Path Length in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) enable fully parallel token decoding but often remain impractical at inference time due to the many denoising iterations required to refine an information-free, fully masked initialization into coherent text. Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.
  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding.</description>

Abstract: This report summarizes the 6th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2025), held as a part of the 8th International Symposium on AI Verification (SAIV), that was collocated with the 37th International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV). VNN-COMP is held annually to facilitate the fair and objective comparison of state-of-the-art neural network verification tools, encourage the standardization of tool interfaces, and bring together the neural network verification community. To this end, standardized formats for networks (ONNX) and specification (VNN-LIB) were defined, tools were evaluated on equal-cost hardware (using an automatic evaluation pipeline based on AWS instances), and tool parameters were chosen by the participants before the final test sets were made public. In the 2025 iteration, 8 teams participated on a diverse set of 16 regular and 9 extended benchmarks. This report summarizes the rules, benchmarks, participating tools, results, and lessons learned from this iteration of this competition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Jailbreak Mitigation Using Semantic Linear Classification in a Multi-Staged Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks pose persistent security challenges to large language model (LLM)-based systems. We present an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substantially reducing attack throughput while incurring negligible computational overhead.
  Building on this efficient foundation, the full pipeline integrates complementary detection and mitigation mechanisms that operate at successive stages, providing strong robustness with minimal latency. In comparative experiments, our SVM-based configuration improves overall accuracy from 35.1% to 93.4% while reducing average time to completion from approximately 450s to 47s, yielding over 10 times lower latency than ShieldGemma. These results demonstrate that the proposed design simultaneously advances defensive precision and efficiency, addressing a core limitation of current model-based moderators.
  Evaluation across a curated corpus of over 30,000 labeled prompts, including benign, jailbreak, and application-layer injections, confirms that staged, resource-efficient defenses can robustly secure modern LLM-driven applications.</description>

      <title>IndoorUAV: Benchmarking Vision-Language UAV Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.</description>

      <title>The Erasure Illusion: Stress-Testing the Generalization of LLM Forgetting Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19025v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data influences from trained models, a capability essential for adhering to copyright laws and ensuring AI safety. Current unlearning metrics typically measure success by monitoring the model's performance degradation on the specific unlearning dataset ($D_u$). We argue that for Large Language Models (LLMs), this evaluation paradigm is insufficient and potentially misleading. Many real-world uses of unlearning--motivated by copyright or safety--implicitly target not only verbatim content in $D_u$, but also behaviors influenced by the broader generalizations the model derived from it. We demonstrate that LLMs can pass standard unlearning evaluation and appear to have "forgotten" the target knowledge, while simultaneously retaining strong capabilities on content that is semantically adjacent to $D_u$. This phenomenon indicates that erasing exact sentences does not necessarily equate to removing the underlying knowledge. To address this gap, we propose Proximal Surrogate Generation (PSG), an automated stress-testing framework that generates a surrogate dataset, $\tilde{D}_u$. This surrogate set is constructed to be semantically derived from $D_u$ yet sufficiently distinct in embedding space. By comparing unlearning metric scores between $D_u$ and $\tilde{D}_u$, we can stress-test the reliability of the metric itself. Our extensive evaluation across three LLM families (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Zephyr-7B-$\beta$), three distinct datasets, and seven standard metrics reveals widespread inconsistencies. We find that current metrics frequently overestimate unlearning success, failing to detect retained knowledge exposed by our stress-test datasets.</description>

      <title>Finer-Personalization Rank: Fine-Grained Retrieval Examines Identity Preservation for Personalized Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of personalized generative models raises a central question: how should we evaluate identity preservation? Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.</description>

      <title>DIVER-1 : Deep Integration of Vast Electrophysiological Recordings at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrophysiology signals such as EEG and iEEG are central to neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and clinical applications, yet existing foundation models remain limited in scale despite clear evidence that scaling improves performance. We introduce DIVER-1, a family of EEG and iEEG foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse corpus to date-5.3k hours of iEEG and 54k hours of EEG (1.6M channel-hours from over 17.7k subjects)-and scaled up to 1.82B parameters. We present the first systematic scaling law analysis for this domain, showing that they follow data-constrained scaling laws: for a given amount of data and compute, smaller models trained for extended epochs consistently outperform larger models trained briefly. This behavior contrasts with prior electrophysiology foundation models that emphasized model size over training duration. To achieve strong performance, we also design architectural innovations including any-variate attention, sliding temporal conditional positional encoding, and multi-domain reconstruction. DIVER-1 iEEG and EEG models each achieve state-of-the-art performance on their respective benchmarks, establishing a concrete guidelines for efficient scaling and resource allocation in electrophysiology foundation model development.</description>

      <title>HyperLoad: A Cross-Modality Enhanced Large Language Model-Based Framework for Green Data Center Cooling Load Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is exponentially escalating computational demand, inflating data center energy use and carbon emissions, and spurring rapid deployment of green data centers to relieve resource and environmental stress. Achieving sub-minute orchestration of renewables, storage, and loads, while minimizing PUE and lifecycle carbon intensity, hinges on accurate load forecasting. However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies. The public DCData dataset is released for benchmarking. Under both data sufficient and data scarce settings, HyperLoad consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating its practicality for sustainable green data center management.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sliding Windows: Learning to Manage Memory in Non-Markovian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent success in developing increasingly general purpose agents based on sequence models has led to increased focus on the problem of deploying computationally limited agents within the vastly more complex real-world. A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

      <title>Vision-Language-Policy Model for Dynamic Robot Task Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

      <title>Practical Quantum-Classical Feature Fusion for complex data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum and classical learning aims to couple quantum feature maps with the robustness of classical neural networks, yet most architectures treat the quantum circuit as an isolated feature extractor and merge its measurements with classical representations by direct concatenation. This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features.</description>

      <title>Operator-Based Generalization Bound for Deep Learning: Insights on Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning framework, deep vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHS), leveraging Perron Frobenius (PF) operators to enhance deep kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound for this framework, explicitly addressing underfitting and overfitting through kernel refinement strategies. This work offers novel insights into the generalization properties of multitask learning with deep learning architectures, an area that has been relatively unexplored until recent developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes generalization bounds for multitask deep neural networks using operator-theoretic techniques. The authors propose a tighter bound than those derived from conventional norm based methods by leveraging small condition numbers in the weight matrices and introducing a tailored Sobolev space as an expanded hypothesis space. This enhanced bound remains valid even in single output settings, outperforming existing Koopman based bounds. The resulting framework maintains key advantages such as flexibility and independence from network width, offering a more precise theoretical understanding of multitask deep learning in the context of kernel methods.</description>

      <title>MixKVQ: Query-Aware Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization for Long-Context Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but this progress is accompanied by substantial memory and latency overhead from the extensive Key-Value (KV) cache. Although KV cache quantization is a promising compression technique, existing low-bit quantization methods often exhibit severe performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks. Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache. Experiments on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing low-bit methods, achieving performance comparable to a full-precision baseline at a substantially reduced memory footprint.</description>

      <title>Towards Minimal Fine-Tuning of VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Image-LoRA, a lightweight parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) recipe for transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs). Image-LoRA applies low-rank adaptation only to the value path of attention layers within the visual-token span, reducing adapter-only training FLOPs roughly in proportion to the visual-token fraction. We further adapt only a subset of attention heads, selected using head influence scores estimated with a rank-1 Image-LoRA, and stabilize per-layer updates via selection-size normalization. Across screen-centric grounding and referring benchmarks spanning text-heavy to image-heavy regimes, Image-LoRA matches or closely approaches standard LoRA accuracy while using fewer trainable parameters and lower adapter-only training FLOPs. The method also preserves the pure-text reasoning performance of VLMs before and after fine-tuning, as further shown on GSM8K.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Predicates Structuring urban perception with scene graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.</description>

      <title>Identifying Features Associated with Bias Against 93 Stigmatized Groups in Language Models and Guardrail Model Safety Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit social bias, however, bias towards non-protected stigmatized identities remain understudied. Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation.</description>

      <title>ChemATP: A Training-Free Chemical Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong general reasoning but struggle in molecular science due to the lack of explicit chemical priors in standard string representations. Current solutions face a fundamental dilemma. Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Auto-Prompting with Retrieval Guidance for Frame Detection in Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering plays a critical role in adapting large language models (LLMs) to complex reasoning and labeling tasks without the need for extensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts, combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and automatic CoT synthesis (Auto-CoT) to generate highly effective task-specific prompts. Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value. These findings suggest that structured prompt optimization is a viable alternative to full fine-tuning, offering scalable solutions for deploying LLMs in domain-specific NLP applications such as logistics.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning in the Era of Quantum Machine Learning: An Empirical Study</title>

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive empirical study of machine unlearning (MU) in hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. While MU has been extensively explored in classical deep learning, its behavior within variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and quantum-augmented architectures remains largely unexplored. First, we adapt a broad suite of unlearning methods to quantum settings, including gradient-based, distillation-based, regularization-based and certified techniques. Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity. Shallow VQCs display high intrinsic stability with minimal memorization, whereas deeper hybrid models exhibit stronger trade-offs between utility, forgetting strength, and alignment with retrain oracle. We find that certain methods, e.g. EU-k, LCA, and Certified Unlearning, consistently provide the best balance across metrics. These findings establish baseline empirical insights into quantum machine unlearning and highlight the need for quantum-aware algorithms and theoretical guarantees, as quantum machine learning systems continue to expand in scale and capability. We publicly release our code at: https://github.com/CrivoiCarla/HQML.</description>

      <title>Is Visual Realism Enough? Evaluating Gait Biometric Fidelity in Generative AI Human Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have revolutionized animation, enabling the synthesis of humans and motion patterns with remarkable visual fidelity. However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Driven Zero-Shot Fault Diagnosis of Axial Piston Pumps Using Fluid-Borne Noise Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axial piston pumps are crucial components in fluid power systems, where reliable fault diagnosis is essential for ensuring operational safety and efficiency. Traditional data-driven methods require extensive labeled fault data, which is often impractical to obtain, while model-based approaches suffer from parameter uncertainties. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven zero-shot fault diagnosis framework utilizing fluid-borne noise (FBN) signals. The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios.</description>

      <title>Causal-Guided Detoxify Backdoor Attack of Open-Weight LoRA Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an efficient method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and is widely adopted within the open-source community. However, the decentralized dissemination of LoRA adapters through platforms such as Hugging Face introduces novel security vulnerabilities: malicious adapters can be easily distributed and evade conventional oversight mechanisms. Despite these risks, backdoor attacks targeting LoRA-based fine-tuning remain relatively underexplored. Existing backdoor attack strategies are ill-suited to this setting, as they often rely on inaccessible training data, fail to account for the structural properties unique to LoRA, or suffer from high false trigger rates (FTR), thereby compromising their stealth. To address these challenges, we propose Causal-Guided Detoxify Backdoor Attack (CBA), a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for open-weight LoRA models. CBA operates without access to original training data and achieves high stealth through two key innovations: (1) a coverage-guided data generation pipeline that synthesizes task-aligned inputs via behavioral exploration, and (2) a causal-guided detoxification strategy that merges poisoned and clean adapters by preserving task-critical neurons. Unlike prior approaches, CBA enables post-training control over attack intensity through causal influence-based weight allocation, eliminating the need for repeated retraining. Evaluated across six LoRA models, CBA achieves high attack success rates while reducing FTR by 50-70\% compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates enhanced resistance to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, highlighting its stealth and robustness.</description>

      <title>MixFlow Training: Alleviating Exposure Bias with Slowed Interpolation Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the training-testing discrepancy (a.k.a. exposure bias) problem for improving the diffusion models. During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Achieving Superior Model Merging via Magnitude Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of pre-trained models has given rise to a wide array of specialised, fine-tuned models. Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

      <title>Alternative positional encoding functions for neural transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key module in neural transformer-based deep architectures is positional encoding. This module enables a suitable way to encode positional information as input for transformer neural layers. This success has been rooted in the use of sinusoidal functions of various frequencies, in order to capture recurrent patterns of differing typical periods. In this work, an alternative set of periodic functions is proposed for positional encoding. These functions preserve some key properties of sinusoidal ones, while they depart from them in fundamental ways. Some tentative experiments are reported, where the original sinusoidal version is substantially outperformed. This strongly suggests that the alternative functions may have a wider use in other transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Sprecher Networks: A Parameter-Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sprecher Networks (SNs), a family of trainable neural architectures inspired by the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Sprecher (KAS) construction for approximating multivariate continuous functions. Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints. We demonstrate empirically that composing these blocks into deep networks leads to highly parameter and memory-efficient models, discuss theoretical motivations, and compare SNs with related architectures (MLPs, KANs, and networks with learnable node activations).</description>

      <title>OmniMER: Indonesian Multimodal Emotion Recognition via Auxiliary-Enhanced LLM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indonesian, spoken by over 200 million people, remains underserved in multimodal emotion recognition research despite its dominant presence on Southeast Asian social media platforms. We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework. The dataset and code are publicly available. https://github.com/yanxm01/INDOMER</description>

      <title>DSTED: Decoupling Temporal Stabilization and Discriminative Enhancement for Surgical Workflow Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.
  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.
  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.
  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly interact with data that evolve over time and depend on hidden internal state. We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.</description>

      <title>Attention Is Not What You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a basic question in sequence modeling: is explicit self-attention actually necessary for strong performance and reasoning? We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.
  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.
  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning.</description>

      <title>MT-Mark: Rethinking Image Watermarking via Mutual-Teacher Collaboration with Adaptive Feature Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing deep image watermarking methods follow a fixed embedding-distortion-extraction pipeline, where the embedder and extractor are weakly coupled through a final loss and optimized in isolation. This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization.</description>

      <title>Activations as Features: Probing LLMs for Generalizable Essay Scoring Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a challenging task in cross-prompt settings due to the diversity of scoring criteria. While previous studies have focused on the output of large language models (LLMs) to improve scoring accuracy, we believe activations from intermediate layers may also provide valuable information. To explore this possibility, we evaluated the discriminative power of LLMs' activations in cross-prompt essay scoring task. Specifically, we used activations to fit probes and further analyzed the effects of different models and input content of LLMs on this discriminative power. By computing the directions of essays across various trait dimensions under different prompts, we analyzed the variation in evaluation perspectives of large language models concerning essay types and traits. Results show that the activations possess strong discriminative power in evaluating essay quality and that LLMs can adapt their evaluation perspectives to different traits and essay types, effectively handling the diversity of scoring criteria in cross-prompt settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Confidence Scoring for Detection of Out-of-Distribution Samples, Adversarial Attacks, and In-Distribution Misclassifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent explosive growth in Deep Neural Networks applications raises concerns about the black-box usage of such models, with limited trasparency and trustworthiness in high-stakes domains, which have been crystallized as regulatory requirements such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act. While models with embedded confidence metrics have been proposed, such approaches cannot be applied to already existing models without retraining, limiting their broad application. On the other hand, post-hoc methods, which evaluate pre-trained models, focus on solving problems related to improving the confidence in the model's predictions, and detecting Out-Of-Distribution or Adversarial Attacks samples as independent applications. To tackle the limited applicability of already existing methods, we introduce Multi-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS), a unified post-hoc framework that analyzes intermediate activations to produce classification-maps. From the classification-maps, we derive a score applicable for confidence estimation, detecting distributional shifts and adversarial attacks, unifying the three problems in a common framework, and achieving performances that surpass the state-of-the-art approaches in our experiments with the VGG16 and ViTb16 models with a fraction of their computational overhead.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Preliminary Study of Using GPT-5 for Code-change Impact Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding source code changes and their impact on other code entities is a crucial skill in software development. However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities. Our experiments evaluate the LLMs in two configurations: (1) seed-change information and the parent commit tree and (2) seed-change information, the parent commit tree, and the diff hunk of each seed change. We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini. Furthermore, the provision of the diff hunks helps both models to slightly improve their performance.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks Applied to Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) introduced new discoveries in the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), expanding the existing set of models with KAN-based versions of GNNs, which often surpass the accuracy of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-based GNNs. These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules; however, those studies disregarded the inorganic nanomaterials datasets. In this work, we close this gap by applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) to a recently published large inorganic nanomaterials dataset called CHILI. For this, we adapt and test KAGNNs appropriate for this dataset. Our experiments reveal that on the CHILI datasets, particularly on the CHILI-3K, KAGNNs substantially surpass conventional GNNs in classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</description>

      <title>Anatomy-R1: Enhancing Anatomy Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models via Anatomical Similarity Curriculum and Group Diversity Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1</description>

      <title>LacaDM: A Latent Causal Diffusion Model for Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) poses significant challenges due to the inherent conflicts between objectives and the difficulty of adapting to dynamic environments. Traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively, particularly in large and complex state-action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce the Latent Causal Diffusion Model (LacaDM), a novel approach designed to enhance the adaptability of MORL in discrete and continuous environments. Unlike existing methods that primarily address conflicts between objectives, LacaDM learns latent temporal causal relationships between environmental states and policies, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across diverse MORL scenarios. By embedding these causal structures within a diffusion model-based framework, LacaDM achieves a balance between conflicting objectives while maintaining strong generalization capabilities in previously unseen environments. Empirical evaluations on various tasks from the MOGymnasium framework demonstrate that LacaDM consistently outperforms the state-of-art baselines in terms of hypervolume, sparsity, and expected utility maximization, showcasing its effectiveness in complex multiobjective tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Continuous Solvent Effects from Transient Flow Data: A Graph Neural Network Benchmark on Catechol Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting reaction outcomes across continuous solvent composition ranges remains a critical challenge in organic synthesis and process chemistry. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.</description>

      <title>CASA: Cross-Attention via Self-Attention for Efficient Vision-Language Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are commonly trained by inserting image tokens from a pretrained vision encoder into the textual stream of a language model. This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

      <title>CARE What Fails: Contrastive Anchored-REflection for Verifiable Multimodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-relative reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often wastes the most informative data it already has the failures. When all rollouts are wrong, gradients stall; when one happens to be correct, the update usually ignores why the others are close-but-wrong, and credit can be misassigned to spurious chains. We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, CARE lifts macro-averaged accuracy by 4.6 points over GRPO across six verifiable visual-reasoning benchmarks; with Qwen3-VL-8B it reaches competitive or state-of-the-art results on MathVista and MMMU-Pro under an identical evaluation protocol.</description>

      <title>BabyFlow: 3D modeling of realistic and expressive infant faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of developmental disorders can be aided by analyzing infant craniofacial morphology, but modeling infant faces is challenging due to limited data and frequent spontaneous expressions. We introduce BabyFlow, a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression, enabling independent control over both. Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis.</description>

      <title>REALM: A Real-to-Sim Validated Benchmark for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the \pi_{0}, \pi_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

      <description>arXiv:2512.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a wide range of motion planning approaches for autonomous vehicles has been developed to handle increasingly complex traffic scenarios. However, these approaches are rarely compared on standardized benchmarks, limiting the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses. To address this gap, we present the setup and results of the 4th CommonRoad Motion Planning Competition held in 2024, conducted using the CommonRoad benchmark suite. This annual competition provides an open-source and reproducible framework for benchmarking motion planning algorithms. The benchmark scenarios span highway and urban environments with diverse traffic participants, including passenger cars, buses, and bicycles. Planner performance is evaluated along four dimensions: efficiency, safety, comfort, and compliance with selected traffic rules. This report introduces the competition format and provides a comparison of representative high-performing planners from the 2023 and 2024 editions.</description>

      <title>Owning the Intelligence: Global AI Patents Landscape and Europe's Quest for Technological Sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a key arena of global technological competition and a central concern for Europe's quest for technological sovereignty. This paper analyzes global AI patenting from 2010 to 2023 to assess Europe's position in an increasingly bipolar innovation landscape dominated by the United States and China. Using linked patent, firm, ownership, and citation data, we examine the geography, specialization, and international diffusion of AI innovation. We find a highly concentrated patent landscape: China leads in patent volumes, while the United States dominates in citation impact and technological influence. Europe accounts for a limited share of AI patents but exhibits signals of relatively high patent quality. Technological proximity reveals global convergence toward U.S. innovation trajectories, with Europe remaining fragmented rather than forming an autonomous pole. Gravity-model estimates show that cross-border AI knowledge flows are driven primarily by technological capability and specialization, while geographic and institutional factors play a secondary role. EU membership does not significantly enhance intra-European knowledge diffusion, suggesting that technological capacity, rather than political integration, underpins participation in global AI innovation networks.</description>

      <title>The Epistemological Consequences of Large Language Models: Rethinking collective intelligence and institutional knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine epistemological threats posed by human and LLM interaction. We develop collective epistemology as a theory of epistemic warrant distributed across human collectives, using bounded rationality and dual process theory as background. We distinguish internalist justification, defined as reflective understanding of why a proposition is true, from externalist justification, defined as reliable transmission of truths. Both are necessary for collective rationality, but only internalist justification produces reflective knowledge. We specify reflective knowledge as follows: agents understand the evaluative basis of a claim, when that basis is unavailable agents consistently assess the reliability of truth sources, and agents have a duty to apply these standards within their domains of competence. We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification. Widespread outsourcing of reflective work to reliable LLM outputs can weaken reflective standards of justification, disincentivize comprehension, and reduce agents' capacity to meet professional and civic epistemic duties. To mitigate these risks, we propose a three tier norm program that includes an epistemic interaction model for individual use, institutional and organizational frameworks that seed and enforce norms for epistemically optimal outcomes, and deontic constraints at organizational and or legislative levels that instantiate discursive norms and curb epistemic vices.</description>

      <title>LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description>

      <title>MapTrace: Scalable Data Generation for Route Tracing on Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved human-like performance on many visual and textual reasoning tasks, their proficiency in fine-grained spatial understanding, such as route tracing on maps remains limited. Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision.</description>

      <title>Exploring the features used for summary evaluation by Human and GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Summary assessment involves evaluating how well a generated summary reflects the key ideas and meaning of the source text, requiring a deep understanding of the content. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to automate this process, acting as judges to evaluate summaries with respect to the original text. While previous research investigated the alignment between LLMs and Human responses, it is not yet well understood what properties or features are exploited by them when asked to evaluate based on a particular quality dimension, and there has not been much attention towards mapping between evaluation scores and metrics. In this paper, we address this issue and discover features aligned with Human and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) responses by studying statistical and machine learning metrics. Furthermore, we show that instructing GPTs to employ metrics used by Human can improve their judgment and conforming them better with human responses.</description>

      <title>Clustering with Label Consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient, effective, and consistent metric clustering algorithms is a significant challenge attracting growing attention. Traditional approaches focus on the stability of cluster centers; unfortunately, this neglects the real-world need for stable point labels, i.e., stable assignments of points to named sets (clusters). In this paper, we address this gap by initiating the study of label-consistent metric clustering. We first introduce a new notion of consistency, measuring the label distance between two consecutive solutions. Then, armed with this new definition, we design new consistent approximation algorithms for the classical $k$-center and $k$-median problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond CLIP: Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Transformers for Cross-Modal Alignment in Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO.</description>

      <title>WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

      <title>Feature-Guided Metaheuristic with Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a feature-based guidance mechanism to enhance metaheuristic algorithms for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This mechanism leverages an Explainable AI (XAI) model to identify features that correlate with high-quality solutions. These insights are used to guide the search process by promoting solution diversity and avoiding premature convergence. The guidance mechanism is first integrated into a custom metaheuristic algorithm, which combines neighborhood search with a novel hybrid of the split algorithm and path relinking. Experiments on benchmark instances with up to $30,000$ customer nodes demonstrate that the guidance significantly improves the performance of this baseline algorithm. Furthermore, we validate the generalizability of the guidance approach by integrating it into a state-of-the-art metaheuristic, where it again yields statistically significant performance gains. These results confirm that the proposed mechanism is both scalable and transferable across algorithmic frameworks.</description>

Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.</description>

      <title>Temporal Causal Reasoning with (Non-Recursive) Structural Equation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural Equation Models (SEM) are the standard approach to representing causal dependencies between variables in causal models. In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for On-Demand DNN Inference in the Edge-AI Market</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications at the network edge. A key research challenge in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference by offloading partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We develop a multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and theoretically analyze the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties. These include competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness in auction outcomes. Extensive simulations based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that AERIA significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization. This validates the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse domains. Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate formally correct and usable models against hallucinations, posing a challenge for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), a novel framework that significantly improves the authenticity of LLMs for optimization modeling using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward by leveraging external optimization solvers as verifiers. These verifiers automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality, serving as direct rewards for the RL process. This automated verification process, particularly from classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in generating accurate and executable optimization models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/SIRL.</description>

      <title>AdaCtrl: Towards Adaptive and Controllable Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Budgeting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth. AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06% and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored responses to meet specific needs.</description>

      <title>InterMT: Multi-Turn Interleaved Preference Alignment with Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging tasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A critical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the environment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal understanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence, models must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration, we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack such complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at both global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k prompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled preference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal understanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages tool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this goal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of \InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the multi-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can help facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step. Our project website can be found at https://pku-intermt.github.io .</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucination Through Theory-Consistent Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Toward Revealing Nuanced Biases in Medical LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) used in medical applications are known to be prone to exhibiting biased and unfair patterns. Prior to deploying these in clinical decision-making, it is crucial to identify such bias patterns to enable effective mitigation and minimize negative impacts. In this study, we present a novel framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary (agentic) LLMs to systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. The proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation (red teaming) techniques to identify subtle bias patterns and adopts a customized multi-hop characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of target LLMs. It aims not only to generate more effective red-teaming questions for bias evaluation but also to utilize those questions more effectively in revealing complex biases. Through a series of comprehensive experiments on three datasets, six LLMs, and five bias types, we demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits a noticeably greater ability and scalability in revealing complex biased patterns of medical LLMs compared to other common approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Agent Collaboration with Attention-Based Actor-Critic Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic. This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession swaps).</description>

      <title>AI reasoning effort predicts human decision time in content moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems by interactively developing solutions. This study uses a content moderation task to examine parallels between human decision times and model reasoning effort, measured using the length of the chain-of-thought (CoT). Across three frontier models, CoT length consistently predicts human decision time. Moreover, humans took longer and models produced longer CoTs when important variables were held constant, suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty. Analyses of the CoT content shows that models reference various contextual factors more frequently when making such decisions. These findings show parallels between human and AI reasoning on practical tasks and underscore the potential of reasoning traces for enhancing interpretability and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS): curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$ over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled, evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved 4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool creation, and low-latency deployment.</description>

      <title>TableMind: An Autonomous Programmatic Agent for Tool-Augmented Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Table reasoning requires models to jointly perform comprehensive semantic understanding and precise numerical operations. Although recent large language model (LLM)-based methods have achieved promising results, most of them still rely on a single-turn reasoning paradigm that processes flattened tables in a single forward pass. This paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, including context overflow on large tables, weak sensitivity to continuous numerical values, and the absence of explicit tool-use and reflection. In this paper, we propose TableMind, a tuning-based autonomous programmatic table agent that simulates the human-like cognitive schema of the multi-turn interaction within a lightweight LLM. Instead of adopting a training-free workflow design, TableMind learns to internalize planning, action, and reflection through a principled two-stage training strategy. To bootstrap structured table reasoning capabilities, we construct and filter high-quality reasoning data for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage. To enable precise code generation, we introduce a designed multi-perspective reward scheme and a novel optimization objective in the reinforcement learning (RL) stage. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that TableMind consistently outperforms previous baselines, validating the effectiveness of training autonomous agents to improve overall performance.</description>

      <title>The More You Automate, the Less You See: Hidden Pitfalls of AI Scientist Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems: inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone. We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Tree-OPO: Off-policy Monte Carlo Tree-Guided Advantage Optimization for Multistep Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS derived trajectories, traditionally used for training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in verifier guided reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables consistent policy learning from group relative judgments. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low variance, prefix aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance, a principled path to improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate this through practical SAE implementations, comparing efficient heuristics against a formal quadratic program.</description>

      <title>Explaining Tournament Solutions with Minimal Supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament?", a central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule, the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time algorithms to compute them for all solutions except for the weighted uncovered set, for which the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Abduction: A New Paradigm for Reasoning under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abductive reasoning - the search for plausible explanations - has long been central to human inquiry, from forensics to medicine and scientific discovery. Yet formal approaches in AI have largely reduced abduction to eliminative search: hypotheses are treated as mutually exclusive, evaluated against consistency constraints or probability updates, and pruned until a single "best" explanation remains. This reductionist framing overlooks the way human reasoners sustain multiple explanatory lines in suspension, navigate contradictions, and generate novel syntheses. This paper introduces quantum abduction, a non-classical paradigm that models hypotheses in superposition, allows them to interfere constructively or destructively, and collapses only when coherence with evidence is reached. Grounded in quantum cognition and implemented with modern NLP embeddings and generative AI, the framework supports dynamic synthesis rather than premature elimination. Case studies span historical mysteries (Ludwig II of Bavaria, the "Monster of Florence"), literary demonstrations ("Murder on the Orient Express"), medical diagnosis, and scientific theory change. Across these domains, quantum abduction proves more faithful to the constructive and multifaceted nature of human reasoning, while offering a pathway toward expressive and transparent AI reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference with AI-Noether</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in AI have shown great potential in contributing to the acceleration of scientific discovery. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models are not necessarily derivable from established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI-Descartes, AI-Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior knowledge. However, when existing theories are incomplete or incorrect, these machine-generated hypotheses may fall outside the theoretical scope. Automatically finding corrections to axiom systems to close this gap remains a central challenge in scientific discovery. We propose a solution: an open-source algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system expressible as polynomials and a hypothesis that the axioms cannot derive, generates a minimal set of candidate axioms that, when added to the theory, provably derive the (possibly noisy) hypothesis. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by showing that it can reconstruct key axioms required to derive the carrier-resolved photo-Hall effect, Einstein's relativistic laws, and several other laws.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states, advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems.

      <title>LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official contests of 14 Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 34 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestants, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results are publicly available on our website.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.</description>

      <title>LLM-as-a-Prophet: Understanding Predictive Intelligence with Prophet Arena</title>

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.</description>

      <title>VietLyrics: A Large-Scale Dataset and Models for Vietnamese Automatic Lyrics Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising 647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language and music.</description>

      <title>FreeAskWorld: An Interactive and Closed-Loop Simulator for Human-Centric Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks. To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</description>

      <title>Neural Decoding of Overt Speech from ECoG Using Vision Transformers and Contrastive Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.</description>

      <title>Three methods, one problem: Classical and AI approaches to no-three-in-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Socratic Students: Teaching Language Models to Learn by Asking Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at static interactions, where they answer user queries by retrieving knowledge encoded in their parameters. However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand What We Cannot Say? Measuring Multilevel Alignment Through Abortion Stigma Across Cognitive, Interpersonal, and Structural Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (worries about judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Theoretic Approach for Managing Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>PDE-Agent: A toolchain-augmented multi-agent framework for PDE solving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Energy Efficiency of Local LLMs</title>

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the latter bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot verify its own maximal prediction horizon universally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems. The construction presented here constitutes one representative instance of a broader logical class of such limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.</description>

      <title>Solomonoff-Inspired Hypothesis Ranking with LLMs for Prediction Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a key challenge in AI, especially for real-world tasks, where problems with sparse data demands systematic generalisation. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the construction of a machine translation (MT) assisted and human-in-the-loop multilingual parallel corpus with annotations of multi-word expressions (MWEs), named AlphaMWE. The MWEs include verbal MWEs (vMWEs) defined in the PARSEME shared task that have a verb as the head of the studied terms. The annotated vMWEs are also bilingually and multilingually aligned manually. The languages covered include Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Italian, and Polish, of which, the Arabic corpus includes both standard and dialectal variations from Egypt and Tunisia. Our original English corpus is extracted from the PARSEME shared task in 2018. We performed machine translation of this source corpus followed by human post-editing and annotation of target MWEs. Strict quality control was applied for error limitation, i.e., each MT output sentence received first manual post-editing and annotation plus a second manual quality rechecking till annotators' consensus is reached. One of our findings during corpora preparation is that accurate translation of MWEs presents challenges to MT systems, as reflected by the outcomes of human-in-the-loop metric HOPE. To facilitate further MT research, we present a categorisation of the error types encountered by MT systems in performing MWE-related translation. To acquire a broader view of MT issues, we selected four popular state-of-the-art MT systems for comparison, namely Microsoft Bing Translator, GoogleMT, Baidu Fanyi, and DeepL MT. Because of the noise removal, translation post-editing, and MWE annotation by human professionals, we believe the AlphaMWE data set will be an asset for both monolingual and cross-lingual research, such as multi-word term lexicography, MT, and information extraction.</description>

      <title>CodeTF: One-stop Transformer Library for State-of-the-art Code LLMs</title>

Abstract: Code intelligence plays a key role in transforming modern software engineering. Recently, deep learning-based models, especially Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling these tasks by leveraging massive open-source code data and programming language features. However, the development and deployment of such models often require expertise in both machine learning and software engineering, creating a barrier for the model adoption. In this paper, we present CodeTF, an open-source Transformer-based library for state-of-the-art Code LLMs and code intelligence. Following the principles of modular design and extensible framework, we design CodeTF with a unified interface to enable rapid access and development across different types of models, datasets and tasks. Our library supports a collection of pretrained Code LLM models and popular code benchmarks, including a standardized interface to train and serve code LLMs efficiently, and data features such as language-specific parsers and utility functions for extracting code attributes. In this paper, we describe the design principles, the architecture, key modules and components, and compare with other related library tools. Finally, we hope CodeTF is able to bridge the gap between machine learning/generative AI and software engineering, providing a comprehensive open-source solution for developers, researchers, and practitioners.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Security Code Review with LLMs: Capabilities, Obstacles, and Influential Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16310v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security code review is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process typically requiring integration with automated security defect detection tools. However, existing security analysis tools struggle with poor generalization, high false positive rates, and coarse detection granularity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been considered promising candidates for addressing those challenges. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to explore the potential of LLMs in detecting security defects during code review. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of seven LLMs under five different prompts and compared them with state-of-the-art static analysis tools. We also performed linguistic and regression analyses for the two top-performing LLMs to identify quality problems in their responses and factors influencing their performance. Our findings show that: (1) In security code review, LLMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art static analysis tools, and the reasoning-optimized LLM performs better than general-purpose LLMs. (2) DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest performance, followed by GPT-4. The optimal prompt for DeepSeek-R1 incorporates both the commit message and chain-of-thought (CoT) guidance, while for GPT-4, the prompt with a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list works best. (3) GPT-4 frequently produces vague expressions and exhibits difficulties in accurately following instructions in the prompts, while DeepSeek-R1 more commonly generates inaccurate code details in its outputs. (4) LLMs are more adept at identifying security defects in code files that have fewer tokens and security-relevant annotations.</description>

      <title>ViGoR: Improving Visual Grounding of Large Vision Language Models with Fine-Grained Reward Modeling</title>

Abstract: By combining natural language understanding, generation capabilities, and breadth of knowledge of large language models with image perception, recent large vision language models (LVLMs) have shown unprecedented visual reasoning capabilities. However, the generated text often suffers from inaccurate grounding in the visual input, resulting in errors such as hallucination of nonexistent scene elements, missing significant parts of the scene, and inferring incorrect attributes of and relationships between objects. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework, ViGoR (Visual Grounding Through Fine-Grained Reward Modeling) that utilizes fine-grained reward modeling to significantly enhance the visual grounding of LVLMs over pre-trained baselines. This improvement is efficiently achieved using much cheaper human evaluations instead of full supervisions, as well as automated methods. We show the effectiveness of our approach through a variety of evaluation methods and benchmarks. Additionally, we released our human annotation (https://github.com/amazon-science/vigor) comprising 15,440 images and generated text pairs with fine-grained evaluations to contribute to related research in the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph transformers are a recent advancement in machine learning, offering a new class of neural network models for graph-structured data. The synergy between transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies, summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity, charting future directions for graph transformer research.</description>

      <title>Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing generative retrieval (GR) methods rely on training-based indexing, which fine-tunes a model to memorise associations between queries and the document identifiers (docids) of relevant documents. Training-based indexing suffers from high training costs, under-utilisation of pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs), and limited adaptability to dynamic document corpora. To address the issues, we propose a few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR). It has a few-shot indexing process without any training, where we prompt an LLM to generate docids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the entire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain it to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then map the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Moreover, we devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR. Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art GR methods requiring heavy training.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Growth-Induced Forgetting in Task-Agnostic Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10566v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In continual learning (CL), model growth enhances adaptability to new data. However, when model growth is applied improperly, especially in task-agnostic CL, where the entire grown model is used for inference, it can lead to severe degradation of learned knowledge, a problem we term growth-induced forgetting. Most existing methods that adopt model growth to improve adaptability often overlook the forgetting issue, resulting in compromised knowledge retention, making them unsuitable for task-agnostic settings. To promote both adaptability and knowledge retention with model growth, we identify the key: gradient and parameter sparsity. Introducing SparseGrow, which increases gradient sparsity through layer expansion and gradient gating to enable focused updates on parameters while preserving critical parameters, thus inhibiting forgetting. Moreover, it promotes parameter sparsity with sparse initialization and training, aiming at better control of model plasticity, improving adaptability over new data. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, task-agnostic settings, and a large number of tasks demonstrate the necessity of controlled layer expansion and validate the effectiveness of SparseGrow in achieving high adaptability while minimizing forgetting in continual learning. By enabling model growth with sparsified gradients and parameters, SparseGrow paves the way for building scalable lifelong learning systems capable of continual adaptation with better knowledge retention.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in mean-field games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We prove theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</description>

      <title>How Reliable are Causal Probing Interventions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15510v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) all methods show a clear tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) more complete and reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; and (3) nonlinear interventions are almost always more reliable than linear interventions.

      <title>Automatic Detection of LLM-Generated Code: A Comparative Case Study of Contemporary Models Across Function and Class Granularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation risks incorporating vulnerable code into software systems. Existing detectors face two critical limitations: a lack of systematic cross-model validation and opaque "black box" operation. We address this through a comparative study of code generated by four distinct LLMs: GPT-3.5, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude Haiku 4.5, and GPT-OSS.
  Analyzing 14,485 Python functions and 11,913 classes from the CodeSearchNet dataset, we generated corresponding code with all four LLMs. Using interpretable software metrics, we trained CatBoost classifiers for each configuration. Our analysis reveals that granularity effects dominate model differences by a factor of 8.6, with negligible feature overlap, indicating that function-level and class-level detection rely on fundamentally disjoint structural signatures.
  We discover critical granularity-dependent inversions: while modern models (Claude, GPT-OSS) are more detectable at the class level, GPT-3.5 is an anomaly that uniquely excels at the function level. SHAP analysis identifies the Comment-to-Code Ratio as the sole universal discriminator. However, its predictive magnitude varies drastically across models, explaining why detectors trained on specific LLMs fail to generalize.
  Our findings demonstrate that GPT-3.5's exceptional detectability (AUC-ROC 0.96) is unrepresentative of contemporary models (AUC-ROC approximately between 0.68 and 0.80). Robust detection requires moving beyond single-model studies to account for substantial diversity in structural fingerprints across architectures and granularities.</description>

      <title>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</description>

      <title>AIDOVECL: AI-generated Dataset of Outpainted Vehicles for Eye-level Classification and Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image labeling is a critical bottleneck in the development of computer vision technologies, often constraining the potential of machine learning models due to the time-intensive nature of manual annotations. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages outpainting to mitigate the problem of annotated data scarcity by generating artificial contexts and annotations, significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. We apply this technique to a particularly acute challenge in autonomous driving, urban planning, and environmental monitoring: the lack of diverse, eye-level vehicle images in desired classes. Our dataset comprises AI-generated vehicle images obtained by detecting and cropping vehicles from manually selected seed images, which are then outpainted onto larger canvases to simulate varied real-world conditions. The outpainted images include detailed annotations, providing high-quality ground truth data. Advanced outpainting techniques and image quality assessments ensure visual fidelity and contextual relevance. Ablation results show that incorporating AIDOVECL improves overall detection performance by up to 10%, and delivers gains of up to 40% in settings with greater diversity of context, object scale, and placement, with underrepresented classes achieving up to 50% higher true positives. AIDOVECL enhances vehicle detection by augmenting real training data and supporting evaluation across diverse scenarios. By demonstrating outpainting as an automatic annotation paradigm, it offers a practical and versatile solution for building fine-grained datasets with reduced labeling effort across multiple machine learning domains.

      <title>Efficient Deep Learning Infrastructures for Embedded Computing Systems: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Envision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently achieved impressive success across a wide range of real-world vision and language processing tasks, spanning from image classification to many other downstream vision tasks, such as object detection, tracking, and segmentation. However, previous well-established DNNs, despite being able to maintain superior accuracy, have also been evolving to be deeper and wider and thus inevitably necessitate prohibitive computational resources for both training and inference. This trend further enlarges the computational gap between computation-intensive DNNs and resource-constrained embedded computing systems, making it challenging to deploy powerful DNNs upon real-world embedded computing systems towards ubiquitous embedded intelligence. To alleviate the above computational gap and enable ubiquitous embedded intelligence, we, in this survey, focus on discussing recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems, spanning from training to inference, from manual to automated, from convolutional neural networks to transformers, from transformers to vision transformers, from vision models to large language models, from software to hardware, and from algorithms to applications. Specifically, we discuss recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems from the lens of (1) efficient manual network design for embedded computing systems, (2) efficient automated network design for embedded computing systems, (3) efficient network compression for embedded computing systems, (4) efficient on-device learning for embedded computing systems, (5) efficient large language models for embedded computing systems, (6) efficient deep learning software and hardware for embedded computing systems, and (7) efficient intelligent applications for embedded computing systems.</description>

      <title>HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with static constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

      <title>Conditional Distribution Learning for Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</description>

      <title>What Human-Horse Interactions may Teach us About Effective Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores human-horse interactions as a metaphor for understanding and designing effective human-AI partnerships. Drawing on the long history of human collaboration with horses, we propose that AI, like horses, should complement rather than replace human capabilities. We move beyond traditional benchmarks such as the Turing test, which emphasize AI's ability to mimic human intelligence, and instead advocate for a symbiotic relationship where distinct intelligences enhance each other. We analyze key elements of human-horse relationships: trust, communication, and mutual adaptability, to highlight essential principles for human-AI collaboration. Trust is critical in both partnerships, built through predictability and shared understanding, while communication and feedback loops foster mutual adaptability. We further discuss the importance of taming and habituation in shaping these interactions, likening it to how humans train AI to perform reliably and ethically in real-world settings. The article also addresses the asymmetry of responsibility, where humans ultimately bear the greater burden of oversight and ethical judgment. Finally, we emphasize that long-term commitment and continuous learning are vital in both human-horse and human-AI relationships, as ongoing interaction refines the partnership and increases mutual adaptability. By drawing on these insights from human-horse interactions, we offer a vision for designing AI systems that are trustworthy, adaptable, and capable of fostering symbiotic human-AI partnerships.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.</description>

      <title>GSRender: Deduplicated Occupancy Prediction via Weakly Supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised 3D occupancy perception is crucial for vision-based autonomous driving in outdoor environments. Previous methods based on NeRF often face a challenge in balancing the number of samples used. Too many samples can decrease efficiency, while too few can compromise accuracy, leading to variations in the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) by 5-10 points. Furthermore, even with surrounding-view image inputs, only a single image is rendered from each viewpoint at any given moment. This limitation leads to duplicated predictions, which significantly impacts the practicality of the approach. However, this issue has largely been overlooked in existing research. To address this, we propose GSRender, which uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for weakly-supervised occupancy estimation, simplifying the sampling process. Additionally, we introduce the Ray Compensation module, which reduces duplicated predictions by compensating for features from adjacent frames. Finally, we redesign the dynamic loss to remove the influence of dynamic objects from adjacent frames. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves SOTA results in RayIoU (+6.0), while also narrowing the gap with 3D- supervised methods. This work lays a solid foundation for weakly-supervised occupancy perception. The code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-sudo-Sun/GSRender.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Aware DNN Compression for Homogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) across homogeneous edge devices (the devices with the same SKU labeled by the manufacturer) often assumes identical performance among them. However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Experiments on ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 with the ImageNet dataset show that HDAP consistently achieves lower average inference latency compared with state-of-the-art methods, with substantial speedup gains (e.g., 2.86 $\times$ speedup at 1.0G FLOPs for ResNet50) on the homogeneous device clusters. HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained categorization of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Towards Enhanced Image Generation Via Multi-modal Chain of Thought in Unified Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unified generative models have shown remarkable performance in text and image generation. For image synthesis tasks, they adopt straightforward text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, direct T2I generation limits the models in handling complex compositional instructions, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Although this issue is vital, existing works mainly focus on improving the basic image generation capability of the models. While such improvements help to some extent, they still fail to adequately resolve the problem. Inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) solving complex problems step by step, this work aims to introduce CoT into unified generative models to address the challenges of complex image generation that direct T2I generation cannot effectively solve, thereby endowing models with enhanced image generation ability. To achieve this, we first propose Functionality-oriented eXperts (FoXperts), an expert-parallel architecture in our model FoX, which assigns experts by function. FoXperts disentangles potential conflicts in mainstream modality-oriented designs and provides a solid foundation for CoT. When introducing CoT, the first question is how to design it for complex image generation. To this end, we emulate a human-like artistic workflow--planning, acting, reflection, and correction--and propose the Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) approach, as the data involves both text and image. To address the subsequent challenge of designing an effective MCoT training paradigm, we develop a multi-task joint training scheme that equips the model with all capabilities required for each MCoT step in a disentangled manner. This paradigm avoids the difficulty of collecting consistent multi-step data tuples. Extensive experiments show that FoX consistently outperforms existing unified models on various T2I benchmarks, delivering notable improvements in complex image generation.</description>

      <title>GRADEO: Towards Human-Like Evaluation for Text-to-Video Generation via Multi-Step Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent great advances in video generation models have demonstrated their potential to produce high-quality videos, bringing challenges to effective evaluation. Unlike human evaluation, existing automated evaluation metrics lack highlevel semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities for video, thus making them infeasible and unexplainable. To fill this gap, we curate GRADEO-Instruct, a multi-dimensional T2V evaluation instruction tuning dataset, including 3.3k videos from over 10 existing video generation models and multi-step reasoning assessments converted by 16k human annotations. We then introduce GRADEO, one of the first specifically designed video evaluation models, which grades AI-generated videos for explainable scores and assessments through multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that our method aligns better with human evaluations than existing methods. Furthermore, our benchmarking reveals that current video generation models struggle to produce content that aligns with human reasoning and complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04162v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has shown effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation models. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bleeding Pathways: Vanishing Discriminability in LLM Hidden States Fuels Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit adversarial prompts to circumvent safety measures. Current safety fine-tuning approaches face two critical limitations. First, they often fail to strike a balance between security and utility, where stronger safety measures tend to over-reject harmless user requests. Second, they frequently miss malicious intent concealed within seemingly benign tasks, leaving models exposed to exploitation. Our work identifies a fundamental cause of these issues: during response generation, an LLM's capacity to differentiate harmful from safe outputs deteriorates. Experimental evidence confirms this, revealing that the separability between hidden states for safe and harmful responses diminishes as generation progresses. This weakening discrimination forces models to make compliance judgments earlier in the generation process, restricting their ability to recognize developing harmful intent and contributing to both aforementioned failures. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce DEEPALIGN - an inherent defense framework that enhances the safety of LLMs. By applying contrastive hidden-state steering at the midpoint of response generation, DEEPALIGN amplifies the separation between harmful and benign hidden states, enabling continuous intrinsic toxicity detection and intervention throughout the generation process. Across diverse LLMs spanning varying architectures and scales, it reduced attack success rates of nine distinct jailbreak attacks to near-zero or minimal. Crucially, it preserved model capability while reducing over-refusal. Models equipped with DEEPALIGN exhibited up to 3.5% lower error rates in rejecting challenging benign queries and maintained standard task performance with less than 1% decline. This marks a substantial advance in the safety-utility Pareto frontier.</description>

      <title>Comp-Attn: Present-and-Align Attention for Compositional Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of text-to-video (T2V) generation, reliably synthesizing compositional content involving multiple subjects with intricate relations is still underexplored. The main challenges are twofold: 1) Subject presence, where not all subjects can be presented in the video; 2) Inter-subject relations, where the interaction and spatial relationship between subjects are misaligned. Existing methods adopt techniques, such as inference-time latent optimization or layout control, which fail to address both issues simultaneously. To tackle these problems, we propose Comp-Attn, a composition-aware cross-attention variant that follows a Present-and-Align paradigm: it decouples the two challenges by enforcing subject presence at the condition level and achieving relational alignment at the attention-distribution level. Specifically, 1) We introduce Subject-aware Condition Interpolation (SCI) to reinforce subject-specific conditions and ensure each subject's presence; 2) We propose Layout-forcing Attention Modulation (LAM), which dynamically enforces the attention distribution to align with the relational layout of multiple subjects. Comp-Attn can be seamlessly integrated into various T2V baselines in a training-free manner, boosting T2V-CompBench scores by 15.7\% and 11.7\% on Wan2.1-T2V-14B and Wan2.2-T2V-A14B with only a 5\% increase in inference time. Meanwhile, it also achieves strong performance on VBench and T2I-CompBench, demonstrating its scalability in general video generation and compositional text-to-image (T2I) tasks.</description>

      <title>SWE-Synth: Synthesizing Verifiable Bug-Fix Data to Enable Large Language Models in Resolving Real-World Bugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming automated program repair (APR) through agent-based approaches that localize bugs, generate patches, and verify fixes. However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</description>

      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is a powerful tool in modeling multi-agent interactions and human-robot systems. In practice, since the objective functions of both agents may not be explicitly known to each other, these interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games. Solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (ILQ) approximation of dynamic games, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions and updating its own control policy accordingly in real time, which leads to unbiased and fast learning of the unknown objective function of the peer agent. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables intent communication by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics. Finally, we show how N-PACE outperforms baseline methods that disregard the learning behavior of the other agent, both analytically and using our case studies</description>

      <title>Differentiable Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient computation of parametric solution sensitivities is a key challenge in the integration of learning-enhanced methods with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), as their availability is crucial for many learning algorithms. This paper discusses the computation of solution sensitivities of general nonlinear programs (NLPs) using the implicit function theorem (IFT) and smoothed optimality conditions treated in interior-point methods (IPM). We detail sensitivity computation within a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which employs an IPM for the quadratic subproblems. Previous works presented in the machine learning community are limited to convex or unconstrained formulations, or lack an implementation for efficient sensitivity evaluation. The publication is accompanied by an efficient open-source implementation within the acados framework, providing both forward and adjoint sensitivities for general optimal control problems, achieving speedups exceeding 3x over the state-of-the-art solvers mpc.pytorch and cvxpygen.</description>

      <title>BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML. This open-source benchmark is available at https://github.com/FLASK-LLNL/BOOM</description>

      <title>Focus on Likely Classes for Test-Time Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask: Can focusing on likely classes of a single, in-domain sample improve model predictions? Prior work argued ``no''. We put forward a novel rationale in favor of ``yes'': Sharedness of features among classes indicates their reliability for a single sample. We aim for an affirmative answer without using hand-engineered augmentations or auxiliary tasks. We propose two novel test-time fine-tuning methods to improve uncertain model predictions. Instead of greedily selecting the most likely class, we introduce an additional step, \emph{focus on the likely classes}, to refine predictions. By applying a single gradient descent step with a large learning rate, we refine predictions when an initial forward pass indicates high uncertainty. The experimental evaluation demonstrates accuracy gains for one of our methods on average, which emphasizes shared features among likely classes. The gains are confirmed across diverse text and image domain models.</description>

      <title>A Survey of 3D Reconstruction with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras are rapidly emerging as powerful vision sensors for 3D reconstruction, uniquely capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras produce sparse yet temporally dense data streams, enabling robust and accurate 3D reconstruction even under challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, low illumination, and extreme dynamic range scenarios. These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research. This survey aims to serve as an essential reference and provides a clear and motivating roadmap toward advancing the state of the art in event-driven 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Default Images in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image (TTI) generation, images are synthesized from textual prompts. By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of over 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Neural Quantum Digital Twins for Many-Body Quantum Simulation and Optimal Annealing Schedule Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Transformer-based Neural Quantum Digital Twins (Tx-NQDTs) to simulate full adiabatic dynamics of many-body quantum systems, including ground and low-lying excited states, at low computational cost. Tx-NQDTs employ a graph-informed Transformer neural network trained to predict spectral properties (energy levels and gap locations) needed for annealing schedule design. We integrate these predictions with an adaptive annealing schedule design based on first-order adiabatic perturbation theory (FOAPT), which slows the evolution near predicted small gaps to maintain adiabaticity. Experiments on a D-Wave quantum annealer (N = 10, 15, 20 qubits, 12 control segments) show that Tx-NQDT-informed schedules significantly improve success probabilities despite hardware noise and calibration drift. The optimized schedules achieve success probabilities 2.2-11.7 percentage points higher than the default linear schedule, outperforming the D-Wave baseline in 44 of 60 cases. These results demonstrate a practical, data-driven route to improved quantum annealing performance on real hardware.</description>

      <title>VERDI: VLM-Embedded Reasoning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information. Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, VERDI enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We validate VERDI in both open-loop (NuScenes and Bench2Drive benchmarks) and closed-loop (HugSim Simulator) settings. We find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by up to 11% in $\ell_{2}$ distance and 11% in driving performance, while maintaining real-time inference speed.</description>

      <title>SAEs Are Good for Steering -- If You Select the Right Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However, recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain 2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Unlocking Specialization of Time Series Foundation Models via Structured Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This prune-then-finetune paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines. Source code is made publicly available at https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/Prune-then-Finetune.</description>

      <title>Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor. Previous work has shown that transfer learning can be used effectively with ESNs for single-orbit prediction. The novelty of our paper lies in our use of this pairing to predict the long-term statistical properties of spatiotemporally chaotic PDEs. We also show that transfer learning nontrivially improves the length of time that predictions of individual gKS trajectories remain accurate.</description>

      <title>Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</description>

      <title>WANDER: An Explainable Decision-Support Framework for HPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) systems expose many interdependent configuration knobs that impact runtime, resource usage, power, and variability. Existing predictive tools model these outcomes, but do not support structured exploration, explanation, or guided reconfiguration. We present WANDER, a decision-support framework that synthesizes alternate configurations using counterfactual analysis aligned with user goals and constraints. We introduce a composite trade-off score that ranks suggestions based on prediction uncertainty, consistency between feature-target relationships using causal models, and similarity between feature distributions against historical data. To our knowledge, WANDER is the first such system to unify prediction, exploration, and explanation for HPC tuning under a common query interface. Across multiple datasets WANDER generates interpretable and trustworthy, human-readable alternatives that guide users to achieve their performance objectives.</description>

      <title>FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs), exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability. Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Boosted Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we empirically and theoretically analyze this limitation, proving that for Task Arithmetic-based methods, as more experts are merged, the common information dominates the task-specific information, leading to inevitable rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 experts by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on both vision and language benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.

      <title>MAGIC: Few-Shot Mask-Guided Anomaly Inpainting with Prompt Perturbation, Spatially Adaptive Guidance, and Context Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is a key challenge in industrial quality control. Although diffusion models are promising, existing methods struggle: global prompt-guided approaches corrupt normal regions, and existing inpainting-based methods often lack the in-distribution diversity essential for robust downstream models. We propose MAGIC, a fine-tuned inpainting framework that generates high-fidelity anomalies that strictly adhere to the mask while maximizing this diversity. MAGIC introduces three complementary components: (i) Gaussian prompt perturbation, which prevents model overfitting in the few-shot setting by learning and sampling from a smooth manifold of realistic anomalies, (ii) spatially adaptive guidance that applies distinct guidance strengths to the anomaly and background regions, and (iii) context-aware mask alignment to relocate masks for plausible placement within the host object. Under consistent identical evaluation protocol, MAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse anomaly datasets in downstream tasks</description>

      <title>From Words to Proverbs: Evaluating LLMs Linguistic and Cultural Competence in Saudi Dialects with Absher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces Absher, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects. \texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.</description>

      <title>Vidar: Embodied Video Diffusion Model for Generalist Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling general-purpose manipulation to new robot embodiments remains challenging: each platform typically needs large, homogeneous demonstrations, and end-to-end pixel-to-action pipelines may degenerate under background and viewpoint shifts. Based on previous advances in video-based robot control, we present Vidar, consisting of an embodied video diffusion model as the generalizable prior and a masked inverse dynamics model (MIDM) as the adapter. We leverage a video diffusion model pre-trained at Internet scale, and further continuously pre-train it for the embodied domain using 750K multi-view trajectories collected from three real-world robot platforms. For this embodied pre-training, we introduce a unified observation space that jointly encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. The MIDM module learns action-relevant pixel masks without dense labels, grounding the prior into the target embodiment's action space while suppressing distractors. With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot (1% of typical data), Vidar outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and generalizes to unseen tasks, backgrounds, and camera layouts. Our results suggest a scalable recipe for "one prior, many embodiments": strong, inexpensive video priors together with minimal on-robot alignment.</description>

      <title>OrthoInsight: Rib Fracture Diagnosis and Report Generation Based on Multi-Modal Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.</description>

      <title>ASR-Synchronized Speaker-Role Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor vs. patient or lawyer vs. client, is practically often more useful than conventional speaker diarization (SD), which assigns only generic labels (speaker-1, speaker-2). The state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR+RD approach uses a single transducer that serializes word and role predictions (role at the end of a speaker's turn), but at the cost of degraded ASR performance. To address this, we adapt a recent joint ASR+SD framework to ASR+RD by freezing the ASR transducer and training an auxiliary RD transducer in parallel to assign a role to each ASR-predicted word. For this, we first show that SD and RD are fundamentally different tasks, exhibiting different dependencies on acoustic and linguistic information. Motivated by this, we propose (1) task-specific predictor networks and (2) using higher-layer ASR encoder features as input to the RD encoder. Additionally, we replace the blank-shared RNNT loss by cross-entropy loss along the 1-best forced-alignment path to further improve performance while reducing computational and memory requirements during RD training. Experiments on a public and a private dataset of doctor-patient conversations demonstrate that our method outperforms the best baseline with relative reductions of 6.2% and 4.5% in role-based word diarization error rate (R-WDER), respectively</description>

      <title>Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and on-device inference could transform routine screening for skin cancers. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential dangers arise from unforeseen and inherent biases. A significant obstacle is building evaluation datasets that accurately reflect key demographics, including sex, age, and race, as well as other underrepresented groups. To address this, we train a state-of-the-art generative model to generate synthetic data in a controllable manner to assess the fairness of publicly available skin cancer classifiers. To evaluate whether synthetic images can be used as a fairness testing dataset, we prepare a real-image dataset (MILK10K) as a benchmark and compare the True Positive Rate result of three models (DeepGuide, MelaNet, and SkinLesionDensnet). As a result, the classification tendencies observed in each model when tested on real and generated images showed similar patterns across different attribute data sets. We confirm that highly realistic synthetic images facilitate model fairness verification.</description>

      <title>CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.</description>

      <title>SpeakerLM: End-to-End Versatile Speaker Diarization and Recognition with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict "who spoke when and what" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various real-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue systems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining multiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such as error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of joint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large language model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a flexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under different speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed with a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive experiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively ensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration conditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.</description>

      <title>Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insider threats pose a persistent and critical security risk, yet are notoriously difficult to detect in complex enterprise environments, where malicious actions are often hidden within seemingly benign user behaviors. Although machine-learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promise, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the scarcity of high-quality and realistic training data. Enterprise internal data is highly sensitive and rarely accessible, while existing public and synthetic datasets are either small-scale or lack sufficient realism, semantic richness, and behavioral diversity.
  To address this challenge, we propose Chimera, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and generates comprehensive system logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each agent as an individual employee with fine-grained roles and supports group meetings, pairwise interactions, and self-organized scheduling to capture realistic organizational dynamics. Based on 15 insider attacks abstracted from real-world incidents, we deploy Chimera in three representative data-sensitive organizational scenarios and construct ChimeraLog, a new dataset for developing and evaluating ITD methods.
  We evaluate ChimeraLog through human studies and quantitative analyses, demonstrating its diversity and realism. Experiments with existing ITD methods show substantially lower detection performance on ChimeraLog compared to prior datasets, indicating a more challenging and realistic benchmark. Moreover, despite distribution shifts, models trained on ChimeraLog exhibit strong generalization, highlighting the practical value of LLM-based multi-agent simulation for advancing insider threat detection.</description>

      <title>SafeSieve: From Heuristics to Experience in Progressive Pruning for LLM-based Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead. Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as an efficient, GPU-free, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/csgen/SafeSieve</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. While several recent surveys have explored aspects of LLMs for optimization, there remains a need for an integrative perspective that connects problem modeling with solving workflows. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date collection of related literature is maintained at https://github.com/ishmael233/LLM4OPT.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors of LLM Reinforcement Learning Post-Training: An Empirical Study in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL) post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on a set of experiments across the full Qwen2.5 dense model series (0.5B to 72B), we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: 1. Larger models consistently exhibit superior learning efficiency on both compute and data metrics. 2. The relationship between test loss, compute, and data can be modeled by a predictive power-law which is robust across both base and instruction-tuned models. 3. Although larger models exhibit higher learning efficiency, the analytical learning efficiency term k(N) in the power-law reveals a latent saturation trend in learning efficiency as model size continues to increase. 4. In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Neural Operators for Real-Time Biomechanical Modelling of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health concern with 69 million annual cases. While neural operators have revolutionized scientific computing, existing architectures cannot handle the heterogeneous multimodal data (anatomical imaging, scalar demographics, and geometric constraints) required for patient-specific biomechanical modeling. Objective: This study introduces the first multimodal neural operator framework for biomechanics, fusing heterogeneous inputs to predict brain displacement fields for rapid TBI risk assessment. Methods: TBI modeling was reformulated as a multimodal operator learning problem. We proposed two fusion strategies: field projection for Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architectures and branch decomposition for Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet). Four architectures (FNO, Factorized FNO, Multi-Grid FNO, and DeepONet) were extended with fusion mechanisms and evaluated on 249 in vivo Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) datasets (20-90 Hz). Results: Multi-Grid FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3% spatial fidelity). DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s, 7x speedup), suitable for edge deployment. All architectures reduced computation from hours to milliseconds. Conclusion: Multimodal neural operators enable efficient, real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment. This framework establishes a generalizable paradigm for heterogeneous data fusion in scientific domains, including precision medicine.</description>

      <title>AndesVL Technical Report: An Efficient Mobile-side Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.</description>

      <title>DiffEM: Learning from Corrupted Data with Diffusion Models via Expectation Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>SSL4RL: Revisiting Self-supervised Learning as Intrinsic Reward for Visual-Language Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.</description>

      <title>The Reasoning Lingua Franca: A Double-Edged Sword for Multilingual AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical, scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's language reasoning.</description>

      <title>WebATLAS: An LLM Agent with Experience-Driven Memory and Action Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) web agents often struggle with long-horizon web navigation and web task completion in new websites, producing inefficient action sequences unless fine-tuned on environment-specific data. We show that experience-driven memory, combined with look-ahead action simulation, is sufficient for LLM agents to adapt to unseen web environments by remembering past failures and predicting the consequences of future actions. We introduce WebATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented LLM web agent that learns a lightweight internal model of the environment from interaction experience and performs hypothetical action rollouts before acting in the real world. WebATLAS builds a persistent cognitive map via curiosity-driven exploration, stores interaction outcomes as experience-based memory, and evaluates candidate actions in cognitive space using a planner--simulator--critic loop. This enables the agent to reuse past experience, avoid previously unsuccessful behaviors, and generate more efficient plans. We evaluate WebATLAS on the WebArena-Lite benchmark for autonomous web navigation and demonstrate a success rate of 63%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art at 53.9%. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that experience-driven memory, look-ahead action simulation, and hierarchical replanning play complementary roles in enabling robust, training-free web agents.</description>

      <title>Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase.

      <title>AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs. Yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves an attack success rate of up to 95% on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns, a 24% improvement over single-turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests and then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (Llama-3.1-8B, GPT-4o mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</description>

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Model Guidance through Calibration and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.</description>

      <title>Potent but Stealthy: Rethink Profile Pollution against Sequential Recommendation via Bi-level Constrained Reinforcement Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.</description>

      <title>What-If Decision Support for Product Line Extension Using Conditional Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product line extension is a strategically important managerial decision that requires anticipating how consumer segments and purchasing contexts may respond to hypothetical product designs that do not yet exist in the market. Such decisions are inherently uncertain because managers must infer future outcomes from historical purchase data without direct market observations. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a data-driven decision support framework that enables forward-looking what-if analysis based on historical transaction data. We introduce a Conditional Tabular Variational Autoencoder (CTVAE) that learns the conditional joint distribution of product attributes and consumer characteristics from large-scale tabular data. By conditioning the generative process on controllable design variables such as container type, volume, flavor, and calorie content, the proposed model generates synthetic consumer attribute distributions for hypothetical line-extended products. This enables systematic exploration of alternative design scenarios without costly market pretests. The framework is evaluated using home-scan panel data covering more than 20,000 consumers and 700 soft drink products. Empirical results show that the CTVAE outperforms existing tabular generative models in capturing conditional consumer attribute distributions. Simulation-based analyses further demonstrate that the generated synthetic data support knowledge-driven reasoning for assessing cannibalization risks and identifying potential target segments. These findings highlight the value of conditional deep generative models as core components of decision support systems for product line extension planning.</description>

      <title>Expressive Temporal Specifications for Reward Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</description>

      <title>Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14396v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</description>

      <title>GateRA: Token-Aware Modulation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, DoRA, and HiRA, enable lightweight adaptation of large pre-trained models via low-rank updates. However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>HVAdam: A Full-Dimension Adaptive Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity
  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models is increasingly limited by cognitive failures rather than infrastructure faults. Existing observability tools describe failures but do not quantify how quickly distributed reasoning recovers once coherence is lost. We introduce MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems), a runtime reliability metric that measures cognitive recovery latency in MAS. MTTR-A adapts classical dependability theory to agentic orchestration, capturing the time required to detect reasoning drift and restore coherent operation. We further define complementary metrics, including MTBF and a normalized recovery ratio (NRR), and establish theoretical bounds linking recovery latency to long-run cognitive uptime. Using a LangGraph-based benchmark with simulated drift and reflex recovery, we empirically demonstrate measurable recovery behavior across multiple reflex strategies. This work establishes a quantitative foundation for runtime cognitive dependability in distributed agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Affective Multimodal Agents with Proactive Knowledge Grounding for Emotionally Aligned Marketing Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled fluent dialogue systems, but most remain reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings such as marketing conversations. To address this limitation, we propose AffectMind, a multimodal affective dialogue agent that performs proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to sustain emotionally aligned and persuasive interactions. AffectMind combines three components: a Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) that continuously updates factual and affective context from text, vision, and prosody; an Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) that jointly models user emotion and purchase intent to adapt persuasion strategies; and a Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) that optimizes emotional coherence and engagement via reinforcement signals from user responses. Experiments on two newly curated marketing dialogue datasets, MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo, show that AffectMind outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in emotional consistency (+26\%), persuasive success rate (+19\%), and long-term user engagement (+23\%), highlighting emotion-grounded proactivity as a key capability for commercial multimodal agents.</description>

      <title>Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</description>

      <title>Zero-Overhead Introspection for Adaptive Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, which equips models with zero-overhead introspective predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.</description>

      <title>When, How Long and How Much? Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.
  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.

Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved superior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a limiting variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a sign-based momentum-like update, highlighting conceptual connections between the inherent mechanisms of ArcGD and the Lion optimiser.</description>

Abstract: We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making. Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.</description>

      <title>Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.</description>

Abstract: Real-world software engineering tasks require coding agents that can operate over massive repositories, sustain long-horizon sessions, and reliably coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing research-grade coding agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to heavier, production-level workloads, while production-grade systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backends, and tool access.</description>

      <title>PACIFIC: a framework for generating benchmarks to check Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic foundation model for crystal structure denoising, phase classification, and order parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations generate large volumes of noisy structural data, but extracting phase labels, order parameters (OPs), and defect information in a way that is universal, robust, and interpretable remains challenging. Existing tools such as PTM and CNA are restricted to a small set of hand-crafted lattices (e.g.\ FCC/BCC/HCP), degrade under strong thermal disorder or defects, and produce hard, template-based labels without per-atom probability or confidence scores. Here we introduce a log-probability foundation model that unifies denoising, phase classification, and OP extraction within a single probabilistic framework. We reuse the MACE-MP foundation interatomic potential on crystal structures mapped to AFLOW prototypes, training it to predict per-atom, per-phase logits $l$ and to aggregate them into a global log-density $\log \hat{P}_\theta(\boldsymbol{r})$ whose gradient defines a conservative score field. Denoising corresponds to gradient ascent on this learned log-density, phase labels follow from $\arg\max_c l_{ac}$, and the $l$ values act as continuous, defect-sensitive and interpretable OPs quantifying the Euclidean distance to ideal phases. We demonstrate universality across hundreds of prototypes, robustness under strong thermal and defect-induced disorder, and accurate treatment of complex systems such as ice polymorphs, ice--water interfaces, and shock-compressed Ti.</description>

      <title>Human-Inspired Learning for Large Language Models via Obvious Record and Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at extracting common patterns from large-scale corpora, yet they struggle with rare, low-resource, or previously unseen scenarios-such as niche hardware deployment issues or irregular IoT device behaviors-because such cases are sparsely represented in training data. Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding Syllogistic Reasoning in LLMs from Formal and Natural Language Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study syllogistic reasoning in LLMs from the logical and natural language perspectives. In process, we explore fundamental reasoning capabilities of the LLMs and the direction this research is moving forward. To aid in our studies, we use 14 large language models and investigate their syllogistic reasoning capabilities in terms of symbolic inferences as well as natural language understanding. Even though this reasoning mechanism is not a uniform emergent property across LLMs, the perfect symbolic performances in certain models make us wonder whether LLMs are becoming more and more formal reasoning mechanisms, rather than making explicit the nuances of human reasoning.</description>

      <title>SSAS: Cross-subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition through Source Selection with Adversarial Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

      <title>Assessing High-Risk AI Systems under the EU AI Act: From Legal Requirements to Technical Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of the AI Act requires practical mechanisms to verify compliance with legal obligations, yet concrete and operational mappings from high-level requirements to verifiable assessment activities remain limited, contributing to uneven readiness across Member States. This paper presents a structured mapping that translates high-level AI Act requirements into concrete, implementable verification activities applicable across the AI lifecycle. The mapping is derived through a systematic process in which legal requirements are decomposed into operational sub-requirements and grounded in authoritative standards and recognised practices. From this basis, verification activities are identified and characterised along two dimensions: the type of verification performed and the lifecycle target to which it applies. By making explicit the link between regulatory intent and technical and organisational assurance practices, the proposed mapping reduces interpretive uncertainty and provides a reusable reference for consistent, technology-agnostic compliance verification under the AI Act.</description>

      <title>VLegal-Bench: Cognitively Grounded Benchmark for Vietnamese Legal Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.</description>

      <title>Let the Barbarians In: How AI Can Accelerate Systems Performance Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.
  Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.</description>

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Open-Set Graph Node Classification with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.</description>

      <title>Love, Lies, and Language Models: Investigating AI's Role in Romance-Baiting Scams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Romance-baiting scams have become a major source of financial and emotional harm worldwide. These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.
  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT): A battery life prediction foundation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers.

      <title>The Universe Learning Itself: On the Evolution of Dynamics from the Big Bang to Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</description>

Abstract: In today's information-driven world, access to scientific publications has become increasingly easy. At the same time, filtering through the massive volume of available research has become more challenging than ever. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms have shown strong effectiveness in searching large-scale information databases, particularly when combined with modern large language models. In this paper, we propose an Attention-Based Subgraph Retriever, a GNN-as-retriever model that applies attention-based pruning to extract a refined subgraph, which is then passed to a large language model for advanced knowledge reasoning.</description>

      <title>Exploration vs Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</description>

      <title>UniCoMTE: A Universal Counterfactual Framework for Explaining Time-Series Classifiers on ECG Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have demonstrated strong performance in classifying complex time series data. However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications.</description>

      <title>TakeAD: Preference-based Post-optimization for End-to-end Autonomous Driving with Expert Takeover Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically rely on imitation learning (IL) but face a key challenge: the misalignment between open-loop training and closed-loop deployment. This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component.</description>

      <title>Learning What to Write: Write-Gated KV for Efficient Long-Context Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference.

      <title>SCOPE: Sequential Causal Optimization of Process Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.</description>
