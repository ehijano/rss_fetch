      <title>From Literature to Lab: Closed-Loop Advancement of Perovskite Solar Cells via Domain Knowledge Guided LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a next-generation disruptive photovoltaic technology, yet their advancement is constrained by the complexity of perovskite recipe with high-dimensional material and process design space. Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error. Our approach can effectively enable LLM comprehend the domain knowledge, which can efficiently navigate in a high-dimensional, capable to accelerate the advancement in real-world perovskite as well as other material science development.</description>

      <title>Predictive Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics of SEI Formation in Concentrated LiTFSI and LiPF6 Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy-density lithium metal batteries require electrolytes that enable fast ion transport and form a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) to sustain high-rate cycling, a process that remains challenging to capture experimentally. Here, we develop a Deep Potential-based machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework, trained on extensive ab initio datasets and validated against experimental transport properties, to resolve early-stage SEI nucleation at lithium metal interfaces with quantum accuracy. We find that at the Li-metal interface, 3.5 M LiTFSI/DMC induces spontaneous, thermally activated reduction reactions, yielding rapidly growing thick anion-derived SEIs enriched in O/F-containing species. In contrast, 1.5-2.5 M LiTFSI/DMC and 1 M LiPF6/EMC/DMC/EC form thinner, LiF-dominated interphases with slower growth kinetics. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental observations, where 3.5 M LiTFSI enhances cycling stability and rate capability, while lower concentrations result in weaker passivation. Our MLMD framework efficiently captures the electrolyte transport and early-stage SEI formation mechanisms in LMBs.</description>

      <title>Substitutional oxygen as the origin of the 3.5 eV luminescence in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although point defects in hexagonal boron nitride exhibiting single-photon emission attract considerable interest, a broader understanding of defect physics and chemistry in hBN remains limited, potentially hindering further development. Oxygen is among the most common impurities in hBN, and numerous studies have reported a pronounced photoluminescence band centered near 3.5 eV following oxygen incorporation, yet its microscopic origin has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that this emission originates from hole capture by neutral oxygen substituting for nitrogen (ON). The transition mechanism is non-trivial, involving not only a change in charge state but also a substantial structural reconfiguration: the positive and neutral states exhibit markedly different geometries and symmetries. In the neutral state the defect adopts a low-symmetry configuration with out-of-plane displacements of the oxygen and neighboring atoms. The calculated emission energy (3.63 eV) and lineshape are in excellent agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Spin Dynamics of Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spin defects are essential platforms for quantum sensing and information processing. Recently, single spin defects with combined S = 1 and S = 1/2 spin transitions were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this work we unveil their excitation dynamics. In particular, we study the effects of the excitation wavelength on the spin-dependent fluorescence and the spin dynamics of these peculiar quantum spin defects. We find that changing the excitation wavelength leads to a threefold enhancement in both the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and the corresponding magnetic field sensitivity. In addition, we find that the excitation wavelength has a strong impact on the photodynamics of spin complex emitters. Our work presents valuable insights to the mechanistic understanding of spin complex emitters in hBN and highlights the importance of excitation wavelength for optimising their performance in quantum sensing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed acquisition weighting for stoichiometry-constrained Bayesian optimization of oxide thin-film growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) with a concise modification to its acquisition function to incorporate the physical prior knowledge. Specifically, this method multiplies the expected improvement (EI) by a weight encoding prior crystal growth physics. When applied to LaAlO3 molecular-beam epitaxy, the weighting function defines a flat stoichiometric window and penalizes off-window proposals, thereby steering the optimization toward physically plausible regions while maintaining controlled exploration. In a closed-loop optimization, relative to the bare EI, which often proposes off-stoichiometric conditions, the weighted EI constrains the search toward stoichiometric regions while retaining sufficient flexibility to explore neighboring conditions, eventually identifying an optimum slightly beyond the stoichiometric window. Within only 15 growth runs, the lattice constant of the grown LaAlO3 film converged to the bulk value, evidencing efficient and rapid optimization for the ideal stoichiometric growth. Because physics knowledge is incorporated solely through the weighting function, the approach requires only minimal modification to standard BO workflows and is readily applicable to other material systems, offering a general and practical route to AI-driven materials synthesis.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties of AgBiSCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the potential of the hybrid anion semiconductor AgBiSCl2 for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for high-performance energy conversion devices. Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. In contrast, Bi-S bonds exhibit stronger, directional interactions, which help stabilize the overall structure. The coexistence of weak bonding and strong lattice coupling enables favorable modulation of thermal transport properties.Optically, AgBiSCl2 possesses a high static dielectric constant and exhibits strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. In terms of thermal transport, phonon spectrum exhibit mode hardening with temperature increasing. The localized Ag vibrations intensify the anharmonicity, reducing phonon lifetimes and group velocities.For electronic transport, the p-type material maintains a higher Seebeck coefficient than the n-type, while the latter shows greater electrical conductivity. At 700 K, the figure of merit reaches 0.77 for p-type and 0.69 for n-type AgBiSCl2, indicating promising high-temperature thermoelectric performance.In summary, AgBiSCl2 exhibits excellent potential for dual photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications. Its unique bonding features and lattice response mechanisms offer valuable insights into designing multifunctional energy conversion materials.</description>

      <title>Quasi-One-Dimensional Electronic Nature of Ta4SiTe4 Underlying the Giant Thermoelectric Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ta4SiTe4 is a one-dimensional van der Waals material that exhibits an exceptionally large thermoelectric power factor below room temperature. However, since this material has been available only in the form of acicular microcrystals, experimental exploration of the electronic properties responsible for its giant thermoelectric performance has long been challenging. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the one-dimensional electronic nature of Ta4SiTe4 by combining micro-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurements on focused-ion-beam-processed samples. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal anisotropic band dispersions along and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. Consistently, transport measurements demonstrate that the resistivity perpendicular to the c axis is approximately five times larger than that along the c axis at 200 K. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the quasi-one-dimensional electronic character of Ta4SiTe4, which underlies its giant thermoelectric response reported previously, and offer fundamental insights into the role of electronic dimensionality in enhancing thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>CatFlow: Co-generation of Slab-Adsorbate Systems via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering heterogeneous catalysts tailored for specific reaction intermediates remains a fundamental bottleneck in materials science. While traditional trial-and-error methods and recent generative models have shown promise, they struggle to capture the intrinsic coupling between surface geometry and adsorbate interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CatFlow, a flow matching-based framework for de novo design and structure prediction of heterogeneous catalysts. Our model operates on a primitive cell-based factorized representation of the slab-adsorbate complex, reducing the number of learnable variables by an average of 9.2x while explicitly encoding the surface orientation of the slab-adsorbate interface. Experiments on the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset demonstrate that CatFlow significantly improves the structural fidelity of generated catalysts compared to autoregressive and sequential baselines. Further experiments show that the generated structures accurately capture the adsorption energy distributions of physically plausible interfaces and lie closer to thermodynamic local minima.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in Atomically Thin Metallic TaNiTe$_5$ with Ultrahigh Carrier Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric metals, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallic conductivity, present a fundamental challenge due to the screening effect of free charge carriers on the long-range electric dipole order. Existing strategies to circumvent this obstacle include employing two-dimensional (2D) crystals, where reduced dimensionality and low carrier densities suppress screening, or designing materials of van der Waals (vdW) superlattice with spatially separated and decoupled conductive and nearly insulating ferroelectric layers. Here, we report an alternative paradigm in TaNiTe5, where an ultrahigh carrier density coexists with an out-of-plane ferroelectric order within the same surface monolayer. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we observed robust ferroelectric behavior in TaNiTe5 down to single-unit-cell thickness (~1.3 nm) at room temperature. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) gives structural evidence that the ferroelectricity might originate from the vertical displacement of outmost Te atoms on the surface, breaking the inversion symmetry. Concurrently, electrical transport measurements reveal a metallic state with a carrier density on the order of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ (or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$) -- comparable to that of Copper (Cu). Our findings establish a unique platform for exploring the interplay between ferroelectricity and an ultrahigh density of mobile carriers in the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity Evolution of MOCVD-Grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films Probed by In Situ HT-XRD under Different Reactor Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallinity of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is strongly influenced by reactor design and the resulting growth environment. In this work, we investigate the role of reactor height on the crystallinity evolution of MOCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films by directly comparing long- and short-chamber showerhead configurations. Structural evolution was probed by in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) as the MOCVD-grown films were heated from 25~$^\circ$C to 1100~$^\circ$C. Temperature-dependent XRD reveals a consistent redshift of the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$~($-201$) reflection after HT-XRD heating and subsequent cooling to room temperature for both reactor geometries, indicating a similar thermally driven strain response. Quantitative rocking-curve analysis shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the ($-201$) full width at half maximum (FWHM), with minimum values of approximately 2.03$^\circ$ and 2.72$^\circ$ for the short- and long-chamber films, respectively, reflecting differences in mosaic alignment established during growth. Atomic force microscopy further shows that short-chamber-grown films exhibit smoother surfaces, with root-mean-square roughness values of approximately 7.7~nm before and 7.3~nm after HT-XRD heating, compared to 19.3~nm and 12.3~nm, respectively, for long-chamber-grown films. Overall, these results indicate that reactor height influences the initial crystalline and morphological templates of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and modulates their elevated-temperature structural response, providing practical insights for optimizing MOCVD reactor design for high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ growth.</description>

      <title>Observation of large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and excessive polar magneto-optical effect in Pt/CoFeB/Ru tri-layer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures comprising ferromagnet (FM) and heavy metals (HM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) can host chiral domain walls and topological spin textures, making them highly promising for various spintronics applications. In this paper, we have investigated the magneto-optical properties, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and PMA of Pt/CoFeB/Ru multilayers engineered to possess significant iDMI. We utilized the Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (p-MOKE), Hall response and the domain wall motion in Pt/CoFeB/Ru-systems. Both MOKE and AHE measurements confirm that the films maintain strong perpendicular magnetization for CoFeB thicknesses below 1.2 nm. The effective magnetic anisotropy K_{\mathrm{eff}} of 0.88 \times 10^6 erg/cm^3 has been achieved without any post-annealing, highlighting the high-quality interface in this multilayer design. The angular dependence of the switching field deviates from the conventional Kondorsky model and is well described using a modified Kondorsky formalism, capturing the role of field-induced domain-wall softening and pinning effects in the reversal process. Furthermore, p-MOKE microscopy imaging during the magnetization reversal process provides detailed insight into domain nucleation and subsequent domain-wall propagation. The observations reveal well-defined, stable magnetic domains that evolve coherently under the applied magnetic field. Such a behavior is expected in the system where interfacial DMI, PMA interact to stabilize the chiral N\'eel-type domain walls, which are essential for fast, low-power domain-wall motion driven by spin-orbit torques.</description>

      <title>Broken neural scaling laws in materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.</description>

      <title>Questionable van der Waals Epitaxy of Non-Layered Materials on Fluorophlogopite Mica: The Case of ScN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing stress-free epitaxial films by van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is of interest for realizing flexible optoelectronics and energy conversion devices from freestanding materials released from substrates that template epitaxy. Often, vdWE is presumed on substrates with layers held together by vdW bonding, e.g., mica, without sufficient theoretical basis or experimental evidence. Here, in case of NaCl metal nitrides, we demonstrate the thin film growth of single-domain ScN(111) by conventional epitaxy on fluorophlogopite mica(001) by sputter deposition. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal that the film/substrate epitaxial relationship is specified by [-101](111)ScN||[010](001)mica. The strong dependence of the (111) interplanar spacings with film thickness crystals indicates compressive stress buildup, which rules out the possibility of vdWE. These results are contrary to, and refute, prior claims of vdWE of non-layered metal nitrides on mica. Our findings suggest that conventional epitaxy should be the default assumption for non-layered materials unless conditions for vdWE are explicitly established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AMDAT (Amorphous Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit) is an open-source C++ toolkit for post-processing molecular dynamics trajectories, focused on high-performance static and dynamic analyses of amorphous, glassy, and polymer materials, including supercooled liquids and complex fluids. In this paper, we describe AMDAT's design for efficient long-timescale analysis via in-memory trajectory handling and exponential time sampling, and we demonstrate representative workflows for widely used observables such as radial distribution functions, structure factors, intermediate scattering functions, and neighbor correlations.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spin dynamics in LAFO thin films: from cubic anisotropy to TLS-limited coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature spin dynamics of epitaxial lithium aluminum ferrite (LAFO) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy from 0.44 K to 68 K. The results reveal a crossover from conventional cubic anisotropy-dominated behavior at higher temperatures to pronounced linewidth broadening and higher-order anisotropy contributions at cryogenic temperatures. With the magnetic field oriented along the [100] crystallographic direction, the resonance is well-captured by four-fold in-plane and out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropies. In contrast, measurements with the field along the [110] direction reveal the presence of an unusually large sixth-order cubic anisotropy term that is symmetry-suppressed for [100] but becomes apparent under this field orientation at ultralow temperatures, indicating a substantial modification of the anisotropy landscape. Independent linewidth analysis shows a pronounced peak near 8 K and a subtle monotonic enhancement with decreasing temperatures below 2 K, features consistent with dissipation mediated by a bath of two-level systems (TLS) arising from antisite defects and localized Fe$^{3+}$ moments. Comparison with TLS-based models demonstrates that both exchange-coupled impurities and nearly free paramagnetic centers contribute to the observed damping. Our results establish LAFO as a model ferrite system where disorder-induced TLS limit spin coherence at ultralow temperatures, providing new insights into anisotropy engineering, magnetic relaxation, and the design of ferrimagnetic insulators for coherent magnonics. These findings offer a framework for future optimization of growth conditions.</description>

      <title>Platform and Framework for Time-Resolved Nanoscale Thermal Transport Measurements in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding heat transport at the nanometer scale is critical for semiconductor devices, quantum materials, and thermal management of nanostructures, yet direct local measurements of thermal conductivity and heat capacity remain scarce. We developed a laser-excitation system integrated into a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) for nanoscale thermal transport measurements using ultra-high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). A fiber-coupled laser is introduced via a modified aperture mechanism, enabling flexible holder geometries and large tilt angles without optical elements in the polepiece gap. Synchronization of pulsed laser excitation with an externally gated direct electron detector provides temporal resolution about 50 ns at &lt;10 meV energy resolution. Local temperatures are determined via the principle of detailed balance, and thermal transport parameters are extracted by fitting a forward-time central-space heat diffusion model including radiative losses. For amorphous carbon films, we obtain a thermal conductivity of 1.24 $\frac{W}{m\cdot K}$ and a heat capacity of 821 $\frac{J}{kg\cdot K}$, consistent with literature. This framework enables time-resolved nanoscale measurements of thermal transport in materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Best practices for a proper evaluation and conversion of physical property equations in superconductors: the examples of WHH formulation, Bean model and other cases of interest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years there have been growing concerns about the proper evaluation of physical properties of superconductors, in particular for quantities extracted from magnetic characterizations. Errors can and often do occur due to the following issues: i) several measurement instruments still use Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu units instead of the preferable International System (SI) units; ii) there are decades of valuable publications where, however, equations were expressed in Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu or other unit systems or where constants were normalized to unity, which requires proper understanding and unit conversion in order to correctly evaluate the measured physical quantities; iii) the conversion between unit systems sometimes appears challenging and may not be properly performed. In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae. We will include examples for the correct method to determine the critical current density Jc of a superconductor from the measurement of its magnetic hysteresis loop through the Bean model, and the correct conversion to SI of the equations for Hc2(T) according to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formulation. The goals of this paper are to make the readers aware of the unit conversion issue, to provide useful hands-on tools for proper conversion and to strongly encourage future exclusive use of the SI units and formulae.</description>

      <title>Sculpting 2D Crystals via Membrane Contractions before and during Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When phospholipids crystallize within the otherwise fluid membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles, the resulting molecularly-thin "2D" solids exhibit great variety in their morphology evolution. For instance within membranes containing moderate amounts of the crystallizing component, crystals grow with a fixed morphology depending on vesicle size. Conversely for membranes containing large amounts of the crystallizing species, we find small compact crystals on vesicles of all sizes. However on large vesicles, growing crystals sprout flower petals that lengthen progressively. These behaviors result from two combined mechanisms: First, like other 2D solids, the shear rigidity of phospholipid crystals renders them intolerant to morphologies with non-zero Gaussian curvature. As a result and especially at elevated membrane tension, the cost of bending elasticity is reduced, at the expense of line energy, by the formation of flowers as opposed to compact crystals. Second, the composition-dependent tension rise during cooling relaxes via water permeation of the membrane with a time constant scaling as $R^2$. The amount of crystal formed for a small decrease in temperature determines this composition-dependent increase in stress from thermal contractions versus solidification. Surface Evolver computations motivated using the predicted tension evolution to develop a processing space that maps to experimental observations for initial and growing crystal morphology. Important variable groups are identified, including a scaled ratio of bending to line energy, a vesicle size-independent group for membrane contractions, and a time constant for stress relaxation. Though processing stresses ultimately relax, the crystal morphology persists well beyond the processing window.</description>

      <title>Optimization of random phase approximation calculations for improved energies of molecules, solids, and surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized random phase approximation method (optRPA26) that significantly improves upon conventional RPA. The method employs an empirically constructed hybrid functional to generate DFT orbitals to evaluate the RPA correlation energy, which is then scaled by a constant. Comprehensive benchmarks across molecules, bulk solids, and surface systems demonstrate that optRPA26 consistently achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 0.05 eV for W4-11 reaction energies, 0.07 eV for cohesive energies, 0.09 eV for metal oxide formation energies, 0.11-0.12 eV for adsorption of small molecules on metals, and 0.06 eV for adsorption on oxides. In addition, optRPA26 correctly captures phase stability in metal oxides and magnetic metals. The optRPA26 approach can be run using standard RPA implementations, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose reference method that can accurately capture covalent, ionic, and metallic, and van der Waals bonding in molecules, solids, and interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes quantum sequential circuits (QSCs) as a hardware-oriented paradigm for quantum computing, built upon a novel foundational element termed the quantum transistor. Unlike conventional qubit-based architectures, QSCs employ symmetry-protected topological junctions where quantum gates are encoded as Choi states via channel-state duality and activated through bulk measurements, utilizing ebits to realize the functional analog of feedback loops in classical sequential circuits. This framework establishes a universal model for quantum computation that inherently incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, complementing existing combinational quantum circuit model. Our work advances the conceptual bridge towards a quantum von Neumann architecture, underscoring the potential of hybrid and modular design principles for the development of large-scale, integrated quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Vertical Nb Josephson junctions fabricated by direct metal deposition on both surfaces of freestanding graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical integration of superconducting electronics requires fabrication strategies that preserve pristine interfaces while accommodating oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors. However, existing van der Waals-based vertical Josephson junctions largely rely on transfer-based assembly schemes that are incompatible with elemental materials such as niobium (Nb). Here, we introduce a freestanding van der Waals membrane architecture that enables deposition-based fabrication of vertical Josephson junctions through double-sided processing of a single suspended two-dimensional layer. Using multilayer graphene suspended across lithographically defined through-holes in a SiNx membrane, we realize vertical Nb/multilayer graphene/Nb Josephson junctions without ambient exposure of buried interfaces. The resulting devices exhibit clear Josephson coupling, including reproducible supercurrents and a temperature dependence of the critical current consistent with short-junction behaviour. Well-defined magnetic interference patterns governed by the membrane-defined aperture geometry, together with sub-gap features that track a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like superconducting gap, further confirm the junction quality. This platform establishes a scalable route to vertical superconducting devices based on oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors and van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) show great promise for application as highly tunable microwave sources with straightforward scalability toward large coupled networks. However, details of the magnetization dynamics within SHNOs have thus far not been addressed experimentally, due to the minute time and length scales involved. In this work, we present direct imaging of the magnetization dynamics within a single CoFeB-based SHNO using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Our measurements reveal that the magnon amplitude is the strongest at the two constriction edges, with a pronounced assymetry favoring one edge, and that emitted spin waves exhibit strongly anisotropic propagation. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that grain boundaries and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) play a key role in both effects. Furthermore, the magnetodynamics changed during the measurement, indicating that the CoFeB/MgO interface may be more susceptible to X-ray induced modifications than previously recognized, challenging its presumed radiation hardness.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Superconducting Gap of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatially-resolved laser-based high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have been performed on the optimally-doped HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) superconductor with a $T_c$ at 133 K. Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Topological piezomagnetic effect in two-dimensional Dirac quadrupole altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a natural platform for studying and exploiting piezomagnetism. In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear N\'eel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</description>

      <title>A physics-based data-driven model for CO$_2$ gas diffusion electrodes to drive automated laboratories</title>

Abstract: The electrochemical reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$ into high-energy molecules with renewable energy is a promising avenue for energy storage that can take advantage of existing infrastructure especially in areas where sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels do not exist. Automated laboratories are currently being developed and used to optimize the composition and operating conditions of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), the device in which this reaction takes place. Improving the efficiency of GDEs is crucial for this technology to become viable. Here we present a modeling framework to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space of GDE designs in an active learning context. At the core of the framework is an uncertainty-aware physics model calibrated with experimental data. The model has the flexibility to capture various input parameter spaces and any carbon products which can be modeled with Tafel kinetics. It is interpretable, and a Gaussian process layer can capture deviations of real data from the function space of the physical model itself. We deploy the model in a simulated active learning setup with real electrochemical data gathered by the AdaCarbon automated laboratory and show that it can be used to efficiently traverse the multi-dimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>Sub-nm2 ferroelectric domains via charged 180 degree walls in ZrO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat phonon bands in fluorite ferroelectrics (HfO2 or ZrO2) shrink polar domains laterally to an irreducible half-unit-cell width (0.27 nm) within which the vertical arrangement of dipoles is expected to remain uniform. We report on the direct observation of nonuniform and nearly discrete vertical arrangements of dipoles in ZrO2 thin films consisting of closely spaced head-to-head (HH) and tail-to-tail (TT) charged 180 degree walls, each exhibiting a distinct bulk-like structure. These charged domain walls (CDWs) further compress the irreducibly narrow, laterally stacked domains vertically to a thickness of 1-2.75 nm, yielding in-plane domains with sub-nm2 footprints-among the smallest ever reported for any ferroelectric material. The HH and TT walls form due to their flat longitudinal optical (LO) polar bands and are electrostatically stabilized by bound-charge compensation via interstitial oxygen atoms, which act as natural structural defects at the HH walls. Moreover, these walls are predicted to be conducting and to exhibit ultralow propagation barriers, with HH walls (1.6 meV) being far more mobile than TT walls (22.3 meV), indicating strong potential for low-voltage, domain-wall-based nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: A second-order response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak homogeneous magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.</description>

      <title>The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high-performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium-based chalcogenide materials are well-known for excellent semiconducting properties, notably superior carrier mobility. However, the intrinsic half-bond nature of metavalent bonds between Ge atoms and chalcogens accounts for their inherent brittleness. Here, we report an ultra-high plasticity germanium-based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. GaGeTe single crystals can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi-scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge-Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by sp3-hybridized covalent Ga-Te, Ge-Ge, and Ga-Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) in ion diffusion were performed using the {\sl extended} Kubo-Toyabe (KT) relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ that incorporates an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function for the jump motion of ions. The analysis of the generated $\mu$SR spectra using the conventional KT function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t;\Delta_{\rm KT},\nu_{\rm KT})$ (mimicking the previous analysis procedure) suggest that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.</description>

      <title>Electronic States, Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetism in Germanium 60{\deg} Dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have recently attracted renewed interest owing to their potential in novel quantum applications. Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60{\deg} dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the {\Gamma} point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from {\Gamma} reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices.</description>

      <title>Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic structure of materials analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. We calculate the inelastic differential cross section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac Hartree Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal-field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible $\sim 10^6$ graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided in a repository. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the antiferromagnetic S=1/2 chain and triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</description>

      <title>Continuous invariant-based asymmetries of periodic crystals quantify deviations from higher symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations.
  We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on several Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that about a half of simulated crystals have high values of CIA, while all experimental structures in these datasets have CIA=0. On another hand, many crystals with high values Z' in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'&lt;=1 due to low values of CIAs.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects-central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of Raman and nonlinear optical tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.</description>
