      <title>Hotspots and Trends in Magnetoencephalography Research (2013-2022): A Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to utilize bibliometric methods to analyze trends in international Magnetoencephalography (MEG) research from 2013 to 2022. Due to the limited volume of domestic literature on MEG, this analysis focuses solely on the global research landscape, providing insights from the past decade as a representative sample. This study utilized bibliometric methods to explore and analyze the progress, hotspots and developmental trends in international MEG research spanning from 1995 to 2022. The results indicated a dynamic and steady growth trend in the overall number of publications in MEG. Ryusuke Kakigi emerged as the most prolific author, while Neuroimage led as the most prolific journal. Current hotspots in MEG research encompass resting state, networks, functional connectivity, phase dynamics, oscillation, and more. Future trends in MEG research are poised to advance across three key aspects: disease treatment and practical applications, experimental foundations and technical advancements, and fundamental and advanced human cognition. In the future, there should be a focus on enhancing cross-integration and utilization of MEG with other instruments to diversify research methodologies in this field</description>

      <title>The Unique Citing Documents Journal Impact Factor (Uniq-JIF) as a Supplement for the standard Journal Impact Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Unique Citing Documents Journal Impact Factor(Uniq-JIF) as a supplement to the traditional Journal Impact Factor(JIF). The Uniq-JIF counts each citing document only once, aiming to reduce the effects of citation manipulations. Analysis of 2023 Journal Citation Reports data shows that for most journals, the Uniq-JIF is less than 20% lower than the JIF, though some journals show a drop of over 75%. The Uniq-JIF also highlights significant reductions for journals suppressed due to citation issues, indicating its effectiveness in identifying problematic journals. The Uniq-JIF offers a more nuanced view of a journal's influence and can help reveal journals needing further scrutiny.</description>

      <title>PATopics: An automatic framework to extract useful information from pharmaceutical patents documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical patents play an important role by protecting the innovation from copies but also drive researchers to innovate, create new products, and promote disruptive innovations focusing on collective health. The study of patent management usually refers to an exhaustive manual search. This happens, because patent documents are complex with a lot of details regarding the claims and methodology/results explanation of the invention. To mitigate the manual search, we proposed PATopics, a framework specially designed to extract relevant information for Pharmaceutical patents. PATopics is composed of four building blocks that extract textual information from the patents, build relevant topics that are capable of summarizing the patents, correlate these topics with useful patent characteristics and then, summarize the information in a friendly web interface to final users. The general contributions of PATopics are its ability to centralize patents and to manage patents into groups based on their similarities. We extensively analyzed the framework using 4,832 pharmaceutical patents concerning 809 molecules patented by 478 companies. In our analysis, we evaluate the use of the framework considering the demands of three user profiles -- researchers, chemists, and companies. We also designed four real-world use cases to evaluate the framework's applicability. Our analysis showed how practical and helpful PATopics are in the pharmaceutical scenario.</description>

      <title>GeneticPrism: Multifaceted Visualization of Scientific Impact Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of scholarly impact is essential for many real-life decision-making processes in academia, such as research planning, frontier exploration, and award selection. Popular platforms like Google Scholar and Web of Science rely on numerical indicators that are too abstract to convey the context and content of scientific impact, while most existing visualization approaches on mapping science do not consider the presentation of individual scholars' impact evolution using curated self-citation data. This paper builds on our previous work and proposes an integrated pipeline to visualize a scholar's impact evolution from multiple topic facets. A novel 3D prism-shaped visual metaphor is introduced as the overview of a scholar's impact, whilst their scientific evolution on each topic is displayed in a more structured manner. Additional designs by topic chord diagram, streamgraph visualization, and inter-topic flow map, optimized by an elaborate layout algorithm, assist in perceiving the scholar's scientific evolution across topics. A new six-degree-impact glyph metaphor highlights key interdisciplinary works driving the evolution. The proposed visualization methods are evaluated through case studies analyzing the careers of prestigious Turing award laureates and a major visualization venue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perhaps among the most prominent sites on which we always encourage professors to create accounts are (ORCID), (Reserach Gate), and (Google Scholar), and how to publish and promote their research through social media or through educational platforms, conferences, and scientific workshops Then we try to explain, in the course of the research, in a smooth manner, the ways to activate accounts on these platforms, supported by pictures and a comprehensive step-by-step explanation, as a gesture to encourage the spread of the culture of electronic publishing in light of the escalation of the digital and computing revolution and the desire to catch up with its accelerating pace</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Authorship Attribution: Integrating Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: AA is the process of attributing an unidentified document to its true author from a predefined group of known candidates, each possessing multiple samples. The nature of AA necessitates accommodating emerging new authors, as each individual must be considered unique. This uniqueness can be attributed to various factors, including their stylistic preferences, areas of expertise, gender, cultural background, and other personal characteristics that influence their writing. These diverse attributes contribute to the distinctiveness of each author, making it essential for AA systems to recognize and account for these variations. However, current AA benchmarks commonly overlook this uniqueness and frame the problem as a closed-world classification, assuming a fixed number of authors throughout the system's lifespan and neglecting the inclusion of emerging new authors. This oversight renders the majority of existing approaches ineffective for real-world applications of AA, where continuous learning is essential. These inefficiencies manifest as current models either resist learning new authors or experience catastrophic forgetting, where the introduction of new data causes the models to lose previously acquired knowledge. To address these inefficiencies, we propose redefining AA as CIL, where new authors are introduced incrementally after the initial training phase, allowing the system to adapt and learn continuously. To achieve this, we briefly examine subsequent CIL approaches introduced in other domains. Moreover, we have adopted several well-known CIL methods, along with an examination of their strengths and weaknesses in the context of AA. Additionally, we outline potential future directions for advancing CIL AA systems. As a result, our paper can serve as a starting point for evolving AA systems from closed-world models to continual learning through CIL paradigms.</description>

      <title>Can we measure the impact of a database?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disseminating scientific and statistical data, on-line databases have almost completely replaced traditional paper-based media such as journals and reference works. Given this, can we measure the impact of a database in the same way that we measure an author's or journal's impact? To do this, we need somehow to represent a database as a set of publications, and databases typically allow a large number of possible decompositions into parts, any of which could be treated as a publication.
  We show that the definition of the h-index naturally extends to hierarchies, so that if a database admits some kind of hierarchical interpretation we can use this as one measure of the importance of a database; moreover, this can be computed as efficiently as one can compute the normal h-index. This also gives us a decomposition of the database that might be used for other purposes such as giving credit to the curators or contributors to the database. We illustrate the process by analyzing three widely used databases.</description>

      <title>Towards a Knowledge Graph for Models and Algorithms in Applied Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models and algorithms are an essential part of mathematical research data, as they are epistemically grounding numerical data. In order to represent models and algorithms as well as their relationship semantically to make this research data FAIR, two previously distinct ontologies were merged and extended, becoming a living knowledge graph. The link between the two ontologies is established by introducing computational tasks, as they occur in modeling, corresponding to algorithmic tasks. Moreover, controlled vocabularies are incorporated and a new class, distinguishing base quantities from specific use case quantities, was introduced. Also, both models and algorithms can now be enriched with metadata. Subject-specific metadata is particularly relevant here, such as the symmetry of a matrix or the linearity of a mathematical model. This is the only way to express specific workflows with concrete models and algorithms, as the feasible solution algorithm can only be determined if the mathematical properties of a model are known. We demonstrate this using two examples from different application areas of applied mathematics. In addition, we have already integrated over 250 research assets from applied mathematics into our knowledge graph.</description>

      <title>Linguistic and Structural Basis of Engineering Design Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language artefact descriptions are primary carriers of engineering design knowledge, whose retrieval, representation, and reuse are fundamental to supporting knowledge-intensive tasks in the design process. In this paper, we explicate design knowledge from patented artefact descriptions as knowledge graphs and examine these to understand the linguistic and structural basis. The purpose of our work is to advance the traditional and ontological perspectives of design knowledge and to guide Large-Language Models (LLMs) on how to articulate natural language responses that reflect knowledge that is valuable in a design environment. We populate 33,881 knowledge graphs from a sample of patents stratified according to technology classes. For linguistic basis, we conduct Zipf distribution analyses on the frequencies of unique entities and relationships to identify 64 and 37 generalisable linguistic syntaxes respectively. The relationships largely represent attributes ('of'), structure ('in', 'with'), purpose ('to', 'for'), hierarchy ('include'), exemplification ('such as'), and behaviour ('to', 'from'). For structural basis, we draw inspiration from various studies on biological/ecological networks and discover motifs from patent knowledge graphs. We identify four 3-node and four 4-node subgraph patterns that could be converged and simplified into sequence [-&gt;...-&gt;], aggregation [-&gt;...&lt;-], and hierarchy [&lt;-...-&gt;]. Based on these results, we suggest concretisation strategies for entities and relationships and explicating hierarchical structures, potentially aiding the construction and modularisation of design knowledge.</description>
