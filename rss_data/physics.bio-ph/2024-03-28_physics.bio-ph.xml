      <title>Energy-ordered resource stratification as an agnostic signature of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life hinges on identifying biosignatures, often focusing on gaseous metabolic byproducts as indicators. However, most such biosignatures require assuming specific metabolic processes. It is widely recognized that life on other planets may not resemble that of Earth, but identifying biosignatures ``agnostic'' to such assumptions has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach by considering the generic outcome of life: the formation of competing ecosystems. We use a minimal model to argue that the presence of ecosystem-level dynamics, characterized by ecological interactions and resource competition, may yield biosignatures independent of specific metabolic activities. Specifically, we propose the emergent stratification of chemical resources in order of decreasing energy content as a candidate new biosignature. While likely inaccessible to remote sensing, this signature could be relevant for sample return missions, or for detection of ancient signatures of life on Earth itself.</description>

      <title>Structure and thermodynamics of supported lipid membranes on hydrophobic van der Waals surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the adsorption and physical characteristics of supported lipid membranes is crucial for their effective use as model cell membranes. Their morphological and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale have traditionally been studied on hydrophilic substrates, such as mica and silicon oxide, which have proved to facilitate the reconstruction of biomembranes. However, in more recent years, with the advent of the van der Waals crystals technology, two-dimensional crystals such as graphene have been proposed as potential substrates in biosensing devices. Membranes formed on these crystals are expected to behave differently owing to their intrinsic hydrophobicity, however thus far knowledge of their morphological and thermodynamic properties is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine lipid monolayers on two of the most commonly used van der Waals crystals, graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. Both morphological and thermodynamic properties of the lipid membranes were investigated using temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy. Our experiments show that the lipids adsorb onto the crystals, forming monolayers with their orientation dependent upon their concentration. Furthermore, we found that the hydrophobicity of van der Waals crystals determines a strong increase in the transition temperature of the lipid monolayer compared to that observed on hydrophilic substrates. These results are important for understanding the properties of lipid membranes at solid surfaces and extending their use to novel drug delivery and biosensing devices made of van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>
