      <title>Quantum Critical Dynamics Induced by Topological Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-frequency ac transport in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with chiral disorder near the topological delocalization transition. Our key finding is that the formation of hybridized pairs of topological domain wall zero modes leads to the anomalous logarithmic scaling of the ac conductivity $\sigma(\omega) \sim \log \omega$ at criticality, and $\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{2 \delta} \log ^2 \omega$ away from it. Using the combination of real-space renormalization group analysis and qualitative hybridization arguments, we demonstrate that the form of the scaling of ac conductivity at criticality stems directly from the stretched-exponential ($\psi(x) \sim e^{-s \sqrt{x}}$) spatial decay of zero-mode wavefunctions at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</description>

      <title>Orbitronics in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbitronics explores the control and manipulation of electronic orbital angular momentum in solid-state systems, opening new pathways for information processing and storage. One significant advantage of orbitronics over spintronics is that it does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, thereby broadening the range of non-magnetic materials that can be utilized for these applications. It also introduces new topological features related to electronic orbital angular momentum, and clarifies some long-standing challenges in understanding experiments that rely on the conventional concept of valley transport. This review highlights recent advances in orbitronics, particularly in relation to two-dimensional materials. We examine the fundamental principles underlying the generation, transport, and dynamics of orbital angular momentum to illustrate how the unique properties of two-dimensional materials can promote orbitronic phenomena. We also outline potential future research directions and address some outstanding questions in this field.</description>

      <title>Geometric dependence of critical current magnitude and nonreciprocity in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions in a magnetic field exhibit the superconducting diode effect, by which the critical current magnitude depends on the polarity of the transport current. A number of different mechanisms for the effect have been proposed.Here, we study symmetric, T-shaped planar Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links in an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to an applied current bias. In particular, we vary the longitudinal width (i.e.\ parallel to the current) of the superconducting contacts and the voltage of an electrostatic gate. We observe an increase in both critical current and diode efficiency with increasing contact width and relate the critical current behavior to the induced coherence length of the Andreev bound states that mediate the supercurrent flow through the junction. We further observe a linear trend, with respect to inverse contact width, of the field at which the diode efficiency is maximized, which saturates as the contact width becomes large compared to the coherence length. The smaller field at which the critical current is maximized additionally exhibits a strong gate dependence. We interpret these observations in the context of multiple underlying mechanisms, including spin--orbit coupling and orbital effects.</description>

      <title>Effect of laser field and magnetic flux on scattering in graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how Dirac electrons interact with a graphene quantum dots (GQDs) when exposed to both a magnetic flux and circularly polarized light. After obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we compute the scattering coefficients. These allow us to show how efficiently the electrons diffuse and how their probability density is distributed in space. Our results show that light polarization is key in controlling electron scattering. It affects electron localization near the GQDs and the strength of the scattering coefficients. We also investigate how light intensity and magnetic flux affect the formation of quasi-bound states. In addition, the electrostatic potential reduces the density of scattering states and fine-tunes the interaction between electrons and the quantum dot. This research improves our understanding of electron behavior in graphene nanostructures and suggests new ways to control electronic states at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Anomalous exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entangled Nambu spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of spin degree of freedom can drastically alter the orbital exchange symmetry of electrons, switching their bunching and antibunching behaviors and the resultant current correlations in the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. Here, we investigate the exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entanglement encoded in the Nambu spinors, or the electron-hole degree of freedom. In contrast to the conventional correspondence between spin entanglement and current correlation, we find that singlet (triplet) entanglement of Nambu spinors results in suppressed (enhanced) current correlation. This effect arises because the charge degree of freedom itself encodes the entanglement. We propose implementing this phenomenon in the edge states of a quantum Hall system, where the entangled states of the Nambu spinors can be continuously tuned by gate voltages. Our study reveals a novel relationship between entanglement and charge correlations, offering an effective approach for detecting entanglement of Nambu spinors.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of persistent current in a non-Hermitian disordered ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the Aharonov-Bohm flux-induced magnetic response of a disordered non-Hermitian ring. The disorder is introduced through an on-site quasiperiodic potential described by the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, incorporating a complex phase that renders the model non-Hermitian. Our findings reveal that this form of non-Hermiticity enhances the persistent current, without requiring hopping dimerization. We explore both non-interacting and interacting scenarios. In the former, we examine spinless fermions, while in the latter, we consider fermions with Hubbard interactions. The Non-Hermitian phase induces both the real and imaginary components of the current. We thoroughly analyze the energy eigenspectrum, ground state energy, and persistent current in both real and imaginary spaces for various system parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the combined effects of non-Hermiticity and disorder strength on persistent currents. We find an enhancement in both the real and imaginary components of the persistent current with increasing disorder strength, as well as the non-Hermiticity, up to a critical value. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement in persistent current in the presence of Hubbard correlation. Our findings may provide a new route to get nontrivial characteristics in persistent current for a special type of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Orientation Dependent Resistivity Scaling in Mesoscopic NbP Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of Si transistor technology has resulted in a remarkable improvement in the performance of integrated circuits over the last decades. However, scaled transistors also require reduced electrical interconnect dimensions, which lead to greater losses and power dissipation at circuit level. This is mainly caused by enhanced surface scattering of charge carriers in copper interconnect wires at dimensions below 30 nm. A promising approach to mitigate this issue is to use directional conductors, i.e. materials with anisotropic Fermi surface, where proper alignment of crystalline orientation and transport direction can minimize surface scattering. In this work, we perform a resistivity scaling study of the anisotropic semimetal NbP as a function of crystalline orientation. We use here focused ion beam to pattern and scale down NbP crystallites to dimensions comparable to the electron scattering length at cryogenic temperatures. The experimental transport properties are correlated with the Fermi surface characteristics through a theoretical model, thus identifying the physical mechanisms that influence the resistivity scaling of anisotropic conductors. Our methodology provides an effective approach for early evaluation of anisotropic materials as future ultra-scalable interconnects, even when they are unavailable as epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Delta-function-potential junctions with quasiparticles occupying tilted bands with quadratic-in-momentum dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our explorations of the transport characteristics in junction-configurations comprising semimetals with quadratic band-crossings, observed in the bandstructures of both two- and three-dimensional materials. Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-function potentials. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion. Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Evidence for topological origin of large spin-shift current in antiferromagnetic Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift current is a non-linear photocurrent generally associated with the underlying quantum geometry. However, a topological origin for the shift photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric systems has recently been proposed. The corresponding topological classification goes beyond the ten-fold paradigm and is associated with the presence of a reverting Thouless pump (RTP). In this work we examine an antiferromagnetic monolayer within the family of MXenes, Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$. This material is centrosymmetric, however, magnetic ordering violates inversion symmetry. We demonstrate evidence of an RTP in each spin-sector which has been perturbed, destroying quantization of the invariant. Nevertheless, a giant spin-resolved shift current persists. We further investigate the mid-gap edge states and classification of the system as a fragile topological insulator to which trivial bands have been coupled.</description>

      <title>Predictive simulations of the dynamical response of mesoscopic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity of mesoscopic quantum devices increases, simulations are becoming an invaluable tool for understanding their behavior. This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric photocurrents of quasiparticles in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of magnetic bubbles in [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on an oxygen-reconstructed Nb(110) surface via an ultra-thin Cu interlayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films hosting topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, hold high potential for breakthroughs in the field of spintronics, due to good scalability and energy efficiency. Novel computational architectures such as memory-in-logic devices rely on material platforms able to host those topological spin textures. Furthermore, recently proposed designs of novel quantum information technologies are based on heterostructures where topological spin textures are in direct proximity to a superconducting layer. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of out-of-plane magnetic bubbles in highly ordered [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on a Nb(110) single crystal. This is achieved without the need for removal of the well-known Nb(110)-oxide surface reconstruction, due to the introduction of a one-atom-thick Cu interlayer in between the Nb substrate and the magnetic multilayer. The Cu interlayer generates a well-ordered hexagonal surface, which is key for the epitaxial growth of the [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers hosting the desired out-of-plane anisotropy. The magnetic ground state of the prepared material stacks is directly imaged via spin-polarized low energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM), revealing the presence of magnetic bubble domains with lateral sizes as small as 450 nm.</description>

      <title>Effect of Annealing on Al Diffusion and its Impact on the Properties of Ga$_2$O$_3$ Thin Films Deposited on c-plane Sapphire by RF Sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gallium oxide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor which has been steadily growing in popularity due to its ultra-wide bandgap, suitability for harsh environments and distinctive opto-electrical properties. Notable applications include deep-UV photodetectors, low loss waveguides or even transparent solar cells. RF sputtering stands out among possible techniques for the epitaxial deposition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films with high quality and at a low cost. By using sapphire substrates, and through thermal annealing, we can form a $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy by Al diffusion, which has tunable opto-electrical properties such as the bandgap and breakdown electric field.
  In this work, techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical transmission are used to determine the optical properties, morphology and composition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ deposited and annealed thin films. To explore the formation of the $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy, annealing was performed at variable temperature, in ambient air. It was determined that the bandgap can indeed be tuned between 4.85 and 5.30 eV by varying the annealing temperature, corresponding to an Al content between 0$-$68.5.</description>

      <title>Directional optical parametric amplification in a hyperbolic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical parametric amplification (OPA) comprises essentially a nonlinear four-wave mixing process in which a "pump" and a "signal" field give rise to an "idler" field under certain phase-matching conditions. Here we use a photonic crystal waveguide strongly-coupled with an excitonic reservoir to generate this process between different guided modes at optical wavelengths. Differently from classical nonlinear optical crystals, where the pump and idler photons travel almost collinearly, our exciton-polaritons are naturally separated in the waveguide due to their opposite group velocities. Due to the high efficiency of the process we can generate the idler field of the parametric process by pumping with a continuous wave laser and choose its direction of propagation in the waveguide by adjusting the angle of incidence of the seed laser. We show the OPA process to be robust against surface defects of the waveguide and can lead to simple-to-fabricate devices compared to microcavities that take advantage of strong signal-idler correlations in a propagating geometry. Our results closely agree with mean-field numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Artificially creating emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism and its manipulation in a magnetic van-der-Waals heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets, with their two-dimensional (2D) atomic structures, provide a unique platform for exploring magnetism at the nanoscale. Although there have been numerous reports on their diverse quantum properties, the emergent interfacial magnetism--artificially created at the interface between two layered magnets--remains largely unexplored. This work presents observations of such emergent interfacial magnetism at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface in a vdW heterostructure. We report the discovery of an intermediate Hall resistance plateau in the anomalous Hall loop, indicative of emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism fostered by the heterointerface. This plateau can be stabilized and further manipulated under varying pressures but collapses under high pressures over 10 GPa. Our theoretical calculations reveal that charge transfer at the interface is pivotal in establishing the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. This work illuminates the previously unexplored emergent interfacial magnetism at a vdW interface comprised of a ferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator, and highlights its gradual evolution under increasing pressure. These findings enrich the portfolio of emergent interfacial magnetism and support further investigations on vdW magnetic interfaces and the development of next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Confined Electromagnetic Waves in Media Composed of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are quantum materials combining insulating bulk properties with conductive surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry. Their unique electromagnetic behavior originates from the topological magnetoelectric effect encoded in an axion-like $\theta$-term ($\theta$ = $\pi$ mod 2$\pi$). This $\theta$-electrodynamics modifies Maxwell's equations specifically at material interfaces through altered boundary conditions, preserving conventional bulk electrodynamics while enabling surface-mediated optical effects like polarization rotation and hybrid wave modes.
  This thesis explores electromagnetic wave confinement in TI-based waveguides. Key advances include: (1) Controlled modification of reactive and dissipated energies through polarization engineering in waveguide geometries; (2) Experimental realization of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves violating Earnshaw's theorem via $\theta$ discontinuities in coaxial TI structures, demonstrating unique polarization rotation mechanisms and low-loss propagation through bent fibers; (3) TEM wave confinement with fewer than two conductors using imaginary $\theta$ parameters, explained through self-consistent surface charge dynamics; (4) First-principles identification of hybrid TE-TM modes in TI slab waveguides, contrasting with conventional magnetoelectric material responses. These findings establish how surface boundary condition modifications from $\theta$ enable new electromagnetic solutions despite unchanged bulk equations.
  The demonstrated phenomena -- including modified propagation modes, non-trivial polarization dynamics, and unconventional confinement -- suggest photonic applications in polarization control and optical routing. By connecting topological electrodynamics with waveguide physics, this work provides both fundamental insights and practical design principles for topological photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined STEM, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20 % of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance, highlighting the importance of weak spots in junction parameters such as resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like spin textures with a nontrivial topology, which ensures their stability even at the nanometer scale. This feature establishes skyrmions as promising information carriers for novel magnetic storage and processing devices, e.g., racetrack memories. However, their fate in various magnetic backgrounds is poorly understood. Here, we show that spiral multiferroics, some of the simplest noncollinear magnets, host bimerons -- skyrmionic textures formed by vortex-antivortex pairs. The bimeron carries magnetic and ferroelectric dipole moments that remarkably depend on its position relative to the spiral background. This property enables precise positioning of the bimeron using a slowly rotating magnetic field, as a $2\pi$ field rotation shifts the bimeron by one spiral period. We also investigate the non-adiabatic regime that occurs when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical threshold. The results establish a new paradigm in which the background endows topological spin textures with unique functionalities, highlighting spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack.</description>

Abstract: We compute the magnetic response of hollow semimetal cylinders and rings to the presence of an axial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux, in the absence of interactions. We predict nullification of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a class of dispersion laws that includes "non-relativistic" dispersion and demonstrate that at zero flux the ground-state of a very short "armchair" graphene tube will exhibit a ferromagnetic broken symmetry. We also compute the diamagnetic response of bulk semimetals to the presence of a uniform magnetic field, specifically predicting that the susceptibility has a logarithmic dependence on the size of the sample.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the imaging properties of copper-based superlens surrounded by copper oxide (Cu$_2$O). A subwavelength image resolution of the order $\lambda/9$ is demonstrated theoretically and verified in numerical simulations. It is shown that the existence of excitons in Cu$_2$O influence the static and dynamical optical properties of the lens. In particular, an improvement of image quality caused by absorption in the spectral region of excitonic resonances is investigated. The plasmon-exciton interaction in the system may pave the way to a tunable, highly nonlinear superlens designs.</description>

Abstract: We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems, deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in the development of nanomechanical spin devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the trARPES spectrum and optical Hall conductivity in periodically driven twisted bilayer graphene, considering both steady-state and "projected" occupations of the Floquet state. In periodically driven pre-thermalized systems, steady-state occupation of Floquet states is predicted to occur when coupled to a bath, while these states have projected occupation instantaneously after the driving starts. We study how these two regimes can give markedly different responses in optical transport properties. In particular, our results show that steady-state occupation leads to near-quantized optical Hall conductivity for a range of driving parameters in twisted bilayer graphene, whereas projected occupation leads to non-quantized values. We discuss the experimental feasibility of probing such non-equilibrium states in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of Landau levels driven by residual strain in the ZrSiS surface band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a multi-valley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid, and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order, or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sub-levels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley's Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to obtain each valley's dispersion curve and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample-dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of $ \lt 0.025 \% $. The extreme valley-polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as $ \sim 0.1 \% $ strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.</description>

Abstract: The stationary Dirac equation $(p\cdot\sigma)\psi=E\psi$, confined to a two-dimensional (2D) region, supports states propagating along the boundary and decaying exponentially away from the boundary. These edge states appear on the 2D surface of a 3D topological insulator, where massless fermionic quasiparticles are governed by the Dirac equation and confined by a magnetic insulator. We show how the continuous system can be simulated on a 2D square lattice, without running into the fermion-doubling obstruction. For that purpose we adapt the existing tangent fermion discretization on an unbounded lattice to account for a lattice termination that simulates the magnetic insulator interface.</description>

Abstract: Introducing superconductivity into group IV elements by doping has long promised a pathway to introduce quantum functionalities into well-established semiconductor technologies. The non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into Si or Ge has successfully shown superconductivity can be achieved, however, the origin of superconductivity has been obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>

Abstract: We study the chirally symmetric continuum model (CS-CM) of the twisted bilayer graphene. The equation on a flat band could be interpreted as a Dirac equation on a torus in the external non-abelian magnetic field. We prove that the existence of the flat band implies that the wave-function has a zero and vice verse. We found a hidden solution in the CS-CM model that has a pole instead of a zero. Our main result is that in the basis of the flat band and hidden wave functions the flat band could be interpreted as Landau level in the external magnetic field. From that interpretation we show the existence of extra flat bands in the magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK</title>

Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.</description>
