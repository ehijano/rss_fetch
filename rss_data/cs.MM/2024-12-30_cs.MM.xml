      <title>Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2CI-Dubber}.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rate Control for Deep Video Compression with Rate-Distortion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep video compression has made significant progress in recent years, achieving rate-distortion performance that surpasses that of traditional video compression methods. However, rate control schemes tailored for deep video compression have not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based $\lambda$-domain rate control scheme for deep video compression, which determines the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each to-be-coded frame based on the rate-distortion-$\lambda$ (R-D-$\lambda$) relationships directly learned from uncompressed frames, achieving high rate control accuracy efficiently without the need for pre-encoding. Moreover, this content-aware scheme is able to mitigate inter-frame quality fluctuations and adapt to abrupt changes in video content. Specifically, we introduce two neural network-based predictors to estimate the relationship between bitrate and $\lambda$, as well as the relationship between distortion and $\lambda$ for each frame. Then we determine the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each frame to achieve the target bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high rate control accuracy at the mini-GOP level with low time overhead and mitigates inter-frame quality fluctuations across video content of varying resolutions.</description>

      <title>A Rhetorical Relations-Based Framework for Tailored Multimedia Document Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital content, the task of summarizing multimedia documents, which encompass textual, visual, and auditory elements, presents intricate challenges. These challenges include extracting pertinent information from diverse formats, maintaining the structural integrity and semantic coherence of the original content, and generating concise yet informative summaries. This paper introduces a novel framework for multimedia document summarization that capitalizes on the inherent structure of the document to craft coherent and succinct summaries. Central to this framework is the incorporation of a rhetorical structure for structural analysis, augmented by a graph-based representation to facilitate the extraction of pivotal information. Weighting algorithms are employed to assign significance values to document units, thereby enabling effective ranking and selection of relevant content. Furthermore, the framework is designed to accommodate user preferences and time constraints, ensuring the production of personalized and contextually relevant summaries. The summarization process is elaborately delineated, encompassing document specification, graph construction, unit weighting, and summary extraction, supported by illustrative examples and algorithmic elucidation. This proposed framework represents a significant advancement in automatic summarization, with broad potential applications across multimedia document processing, promising transformative impacts in the field.</description>

      <title>Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18619v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \&amp; evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at https://github.com/LMM101/Awesome-Multimodal-Next-Token-Prediction</description>

      <title>TINQ: Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) has been actively researched for user-generated content (UGC) videos. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely applied in UGC. Therefore, an effective BVQA method for both UGC and SR scenarios is essential. Temporal inconsistency, referring to irregularities between consecutive frames, is relevant to video quality. Current BVQA approaches typically model temporal relationships in UGC videos using statistics of motion information, but inconsistencies remain unexplored. Additionally, different from temporal inconsistency in UGC videos, such inconsistency in SR videos is amplified due to upscaling algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment (TINQ) metric, demonstrating that exploring temporal inconsistency is crucial for effective BVQA. Since temporal inconsistencies vary between UGC and SR videos, they are calculated in different ways. Based on this, a spatial module highlights inconsistent areas across consecutive frames at coarse and fine granularities. In addition, a temporal module aggregates features over time in two stages. The first stage employs a visual memory capacity block to adaptively segment the time dimension based on estimated complexity, while the second stage focuses on selecting key features. The stages work together through Consistency-aware Fusion Units to regress cross-time-scale video quality. Extensive experiments on UGC and SR video quality datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art BVQA methods.

      <title>XRFlux: Virtual Reality Benchmark for Edge Caching Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Unity based benchmark XRFlux for evaluating Virtual Reality (VR) delivery systems using edge-cloud caching. As VR applications and systems progress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud architectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet these demands, especially for users of the same application in different locations. With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in efforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with changing fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates various challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks and propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging users' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The benchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to assess the resulting QoEs. This tool fills a gap by supporting research in the optimization of edge caching (and other edge-cloud functions) for VR streaming.</description>

      <title>Don't Lose Yourself: Boosting Multimodal Recommendation via Reducing Node-neighbor Discrepancy in Graph Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of multimedia contents has led to the emergence of multimodal recommendation systems. It has attracted increasing attention in recommendation systems because its full utilization of data from different modalities alleviates the persistent data sparsity problem. As such, multimodal recommendation models can learn personalized information about nodes in terms of visual and textual. To further alleviate the data sparsity problem, some previous works have introduced graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for multimodal recommendation systems, to enhance the semantic representation of users and items by capturing the potential relationships between them. However, adopting GCNs inevitably introduces the over-smoothing problem, which make nodes to be too similar. Unfortunately, incorporating multimodal information will exacerbate this challenge because nodes that are too similar will lose the personalized information learned through multimodal information. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that retains the personalized information of ego nodes during feature aggregation by Reducing Node-neighbor Discrepancy (RedN^nD). Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that RedN^nD achieves state-of-the-art performance on accuracy and robustness, with significant improvements over existing GCN-based multimodal frameworks.</description>

      <title>MTCAE-DFER: Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper expands the cascaded network branch of the autoencoder-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework for dynamic facial expression recognition, namely Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (MTCAE-DFER). MTCAE-DFER builds a plug-and-play cascaded decoder module, which is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and employs the decoder concept of Transformer to reconstruct the multi-head attention module. The decoder output from the previous task serves as the query (Q), representing local dynamic features, while the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) shared encoder output acts as both the key (K) and value (V), representing global dynamic features. This setup facilitates interaction between global and local dynamic features across related tasks. Additionally, this proposal aims to alleviate overfitting of complex large model. We utilize autoencoder-based multi-task cascaded learning approach to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on dynamic facial expression recognition, which enhances the model's generalization ability. After we conduct extensive ablation experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition, the robustness of the MTCAE-DFER model and the effectiveness of global-local dynamic feature interaction among related tasks have been proven.</description>

      <title>FACEMUG: A Multimodal Generative and Fusion Framework for Local Facial Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing facial editing methods have achieved remarkable results, yet they often fall short in supporting multimodal conditional local facial editing. One of the significant evidences is that their output image quality degrades dramatically after several iterations of incremental editing, as they do not support local editing. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal generative and fusion framework for globally-consistent local facial editing (FACEMUG) that can handle a wide range of input modalities and enable fine-grained and semantic manipulation while remaining unedited parts unchanged. Different modalities, including sketches, semantic maps, color maps, exemplar images, text, and attribute labels, are adept at conveying diverse conditioning details, and their combined synergy can provide more explicit guidance for the editing process. We thus integrate all modalities into a unified generative latent space to enable multimodal local facial edits. Specifically, a novel multimodal feature fusion mechanism is proposed by utilizing multimodal aggregation and style fusion blocks to fuse facial priors and multimodalities in both latent and feature spaces. We further introduce a novel self-supervised latent warping algorithm to rectify misaligned facial features, efficiently transferring the pose of the edited image to the given latent codes. We evaluate our FACEMUG through extensive experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of FACEMUG in terms of editing quality, flexibility, and semantic control, making it a promising solution for a wide range of local facial editing tasks.</description>

      <title>CoheDancers: Enhancing Interactive Group Dance Generation through Music-Driven Coherence Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dance generation is crucial and challenging, particularly in domains like dance performance and virtual gaming. In the current body of literature, most methodologies focus on Solo Music2Dance. While there are efforts directed towards Group Music2Dance, these often suffer from a lack of coherence, resulting in aesthetically poor dance performances. Thus, we introduce CoheDancers, a novel framework for Music-Driven Interactive Group Dance Generation. CoheDancers aims to enhance group dance generation coherence by decomposing it into three key aspects: synchronization, naturalness, and fluidity. Correspondingly, we develop a Cycle Consistency based Dance Synchronization strategy to foster music-dance correspondences, an Auto-Regressive-based Exposure Bias Correction strategy to enhance the fluidity of the generated dances, and an Adversarial Training Strategy to augment the naturalness of the group dance output. Collectively, these strategies enable CohdeDancers to produce highly coherent group dances with superior quality. Furthermore, to establish better benchmarks for Group Music2Dance, we construct the most diverse and comprehensive open-source dataset to date, I-Dancers, featuring rich dancer interactions, and create comprehensive evaluation metrics. Experimental evaluations on I-Dancers and other extant datasets substantiate that CoheDancers achieves unprecedented state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</description>

      <title>FineVQ: Fine-Grained User Generated Content Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets. Both Both FineVD and FineVQ will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Adrenaline: Adaptive Rendering Optimization System for Scalable Cloud Gaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud gaming requires a low-latency network connection, making it a prime candidate for being hosted at the network edge. However, an edge server is provisioned with a fixed compute capacity, causing an issue for multi-user service and resulting in users having to wait before they can play when the server is occupied. In this work, we present a new insight that when a user's network condition results in use of lossy compression, the end-to-end visual quality more degrades for frames of high rendering quality, wasting the server's computing resources. We leverage this observation to build Adrenaline, a new system which adaptively optimizes the game rendering qualities by considering the user-side visual quality and server-side rendering cost. The rendering quality optimization of Adrenaline is done via a scoring mechanism quantifying the effectiveness of server resource usage on the user-side gaming quality. Our open-sourced implementation of Adrenaline demonstrates easy integration with modern game engines. In our evaluations, Adrenaline achieves up to 24% higher service quality and 2x more users served with the same resource footprint compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically, GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the performance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vision-Language Tracking by Effectively Converting Textual Cues into Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking (VLT) aims to localize a target in video sequences using a visual template and language description. While textual cues enhance tracking potential, current datasets typically contain much more image data than text, limiting the ability of VLT methods to align the two modalities effectively. To address this imbalance, we propose a novel plug-and-play method named CTVLT that leverages the strong text-image alignment capabilities of foundation grounding models. CTVLT converts textual cues into interpretable visual heatmaps, which are easier for trackers to process. Specifically, we design a textual cue mapping module that transforms textual cues into target distribution heatmaps, visually representing the location described by the text. Additionally, the heatmap guidance module fuses these heatmaps with the search image to guide tracking more effectively. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating the utility of our method for enhanced VLT.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Diffusion Model for Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) tasks involve explicit cross-modal alignment, as semantically corresponding image regions are to be located for the language phrases provided. Existing approaches complete such visual-text reasoning in a single-step manner. Their performance causes high demands on large-scale anchors and over-designed multi-modal fusion modules based on human priors, leading to complicated frameworks that may be difficult to train and overfit to specific scenarios. Even worse, such once-for-all reasoning mechanisms are incapable of refining boxes continuously to enhance query-region matching. In contrast, in this paper, we formulate an iterative reasoning process by denoising diffusion modeling. Specifically, we propose a language-guided diffusion framework for visual grounding, LG-DVG, which trains the model to progressively reason queried object boxes by denoising a set of noisy boxes with the language guide. To achieve this, LG-DVG gradually perturbs query-aligned ground truth boxes to noisy ones and reverses this process step by step, conditional on query semantics. Extensive experiments for our proposed framework on five widely used datasets validate the superior performance of solving visual grounding, a cross-modal alignment task, in a generative way.

      <title>Read, Watch and Scream! Sound Generation from Text and Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive progress of multimodal generative models, video-to-audio generation still suffers from limited performance and limits the flexibility to prioritize sound synthesis for specific objects within the scene. Conversely, text-to-audio generation methods generate high-quality audio but pose challenges in ensuring comprehensive scene depiction and time-varying control. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-audio generation method, called \ours, where video serves as a conditional control for a text-to-audio generation model. Especially, our method estimates the structural information of sound (namely, energy) from the video while receiving key content cues from a user prompt. We employ a well-performing text-to-audio model to consolidate the video control, which is much more efficient for training multimodal diffusion models with massive triplet-paired (audio-video-text) data. In addition, by separating the generative components of audio, it becomes a more flexible system that allows users to freely adjust the energy, surrounding environment, and primary sound source according to their preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows superiority in terms of quality, controllability, and training efficiency.

      <title>Official-NV: An LLM-Generated News Video Dataset for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To address this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising officially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. We also propose a new baseline model called OFNVD, which captures key information from multimodal features through a GLU attention mechanism and performs feature enhancement and modal aggregation via a cross-modal Transformer. Benchmarking the dataset and baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal news detection.</description>

      <title>Fit and Prune: Fast and Training-free Visual Token Pruning for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation. Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Compact Visual Data Representation for Green Multimedia -- A Human Visual System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Human Visual System (HVS), with its intricate sophistication, is capable of achieving ultra-compact information compression for visual signals. This remarkable ability is coupled with high generalization capability and energy efficiency. By contrast, the state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard achieves a compression ratio of around 1,000 times for raw visual data. This notable disparity motivates the research community to draw inspiration to effectively handle the immense volume of visual data in a green way. Therefore, this paper provides a survey of how visual data can be efficiently represented for green multimedia, in particular when the ultimate task is knowledge extraction instead of visual signal reconstruction. We introduce recent research efforts that promote green, sustainable, and efficient multimedia in this field. Moreover, we discuss how the deep understanding of the HVS can benefit the research community, and envision the development of future green multimedia technologies.</description>

      <title>DLF: Disentangled-Language-Focused Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) leverages heterogeneous modalities, such as language, vision, and audio, to enhance the understanding of human sentiment. While existing models often focus on extracting shared information across modalities or directly fusing heterogeneous modalities, such approaches can introduce redundancy and conflicts due to equal treatment of all modalities and the mutual transfer of information between modality pairs. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled-Language-Focused (DLF) multimodal representation learning framework, which incorporates a feature disentanglement module to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information. To further reduce redundancy and enhance language-targeted features, four geometric measures are introduced to refine the disentanglement process. A Language-Focused Attractor (LFA) is further developed to strengthen language representation by leveraging complementary modality-specific information through a language-guided cross-attention mechanism. The framework also employs hierarchical predictions to improve overall accuracy. Extensive experiments on two popular MSA datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed DLF framework. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the feature disentanglement module, language-focused attractor, and hierarchical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/pwang322/DLF.</description>

      <title>Follow-Your-MultiPose: Tuning-Free Multi-Character Text-to-Video Generation via Pose Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-editable and pose-controllable character video generation is a challenging but prevailing topic with practical applications. However, existing approaches mainly focus on single-object video generation with pose guidance, ignoring the realistic situation that multi-character appear concurrently in a scenario. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-character video generation framework in a tuning-free manner, which is based on the separated text and pose guidance. Specifically, we first extract character masks from the pose sequence to identify the spatial position for each generating character, and then single prompts for each character are obtained with LLMs for precise text guidance. Moreover, the spatial-aligned cross attention and multi-branch control module are proposed to generate fine grained controllable multi-character video. The visualized results of generating video demonstrate the precise controllability of our method for multi-character generation. We also verify the generality of our method by applying it to various personalized T2I models. Moreover, the quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared with previous works.</description>

      <title>RDPM: Solve Diffusion Probabilistic Models via Recurrent Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</description>
