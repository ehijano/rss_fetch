      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets, have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential via limit cycle orbits. However, the number of co-existing quantized states are limited to at most a few limit cycles. By considering a minimal generalized pilot-wave model of the system in the low-memory and low-dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by an oscillatory non-conservative force that displays a countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also know as \emph{megastability}; thus forming a dynamical analog of infinite quantized states. Using averaging techniques, we derive an analytical approximation of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function, of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hegselmann-Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann-Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann-Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann-Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann-Krause model.</description>

      <title>High-order exceptional points and stochastic resonance in pseudo-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, a remarkable phenomenon in physical systems, have been exploited for sensing applications. It has been demonstrated recently that it can also utilize as sensory threshold in which the interplay between exceptional-point dynamics and noise can lead to enhanced performance. Most existing works focused on second-order exceptional points. We investigate the stochastic dynamics associated with high-order exceptional points with a particular eye towards optimizing sensing performance by developing a theoretical framework based on pseudo-Hermiticity. Our analysis reveals three distinct types of frequency responses to external perturbations. A broad type of stochastic resonance is uncovered where, as the noise amplitude increases, the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a global maximum rapidly but with a slow decaying process afterwards, indicating achievable high performance in a wide range of the noise level. These results suggest that stochastic high-order exceptional-point dynamics can be exploited for applications in signal processing and sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Inverse stochastic resonance in adaptive small-world neural networks</title>

Abstract: Inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) is a phenomenon where noise reduces rather than increases the firing rate of a neuron, sometimes leading to complete quiescence. ISR was first experimentally verified with cerebellar Purkinje neurons. These experiments showed that ISR enables optimal information transfer between the input and output spike train of neurons. Subsequent studies demonstrated the efficiency of information processing and transfer in neural networks with small-world topology. We conducted a numerical investigation into the impact of adaptivity on ISR in a small-world network of noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons, operating in a bistable regime with a stable fixed point and a limit cycle -- a prerequisite for ISR. Our results show that the degree of ISR is highly dependent on the FHN model's timescale separation parameter $\epsilon$. The network structure undergoes dynamic adaptation via mechanisms of either spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with potentiation-/depression-domination parameter $P$, or homeostatic structural plasticity (HSP) with rewiring frequency $F$. We demonstrate that both STDP and HSP amplify ISR when $\epsilon$ lies within the bistability region of FHN neurons. Specifically, at larger values of $\epsilon$ within the bistability regime, higher rewiring frequencies $F$ enhance ISR at intermediate (weak) synaptic noise intensities, while values of $P$ consistent with depression-domination (potentiation-domination) enhance (deteriorate) ISR. Moreover, although STDP and HSP parameters may jointly enhance ISR, $P$ has a greater impact on ISR compared to $F$. Our findings inform future ISR enhancement strategies in noisy artificial neural circuits, aiming to optimize information transfer between input and output spike trains in neuromorphic systems, and prompt venues for experiments in neural networks.</description>
