      <title>Modelling and valuation of catastrophe bonds across multiple regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insurance-linked securities (ILS) market, as a form of alternative risk transfer, has been at the forefront of innovative risk-transfer solutions. The catastrophe bond (CAT bond) market now represents almost half of the entire ILS market and is growing steadily. Since CAT bonds are often tied to risks in different regions, we follow this idea by constructing different pricing models that incorporate various scenarios of dependence between catastrophe losses in different areas. Namely, we consider independent, proportional, and arbitrary two-dimensional distribution cases. We also derive a normal approximation of the prices. Finally, to include the market price of risk, we apply Wang's transform. We illustrate the differences between the scenarios and the performance of the approximation on the Property Claim Services data.</description>

      <title>The Endogenous Constraint: Hysteresis, Stagflation, and the Structural Inhibition of Monetary Velocity in the Bitcoin Network (2016-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin operates as a macroeconomic paradox: it combines a strictly predetermined, inelastic monetary issuance schedule with a stochastic, highly elastic demand for scarce block space. This paper empirically validates the Endogenous Constraint Hypothesis, positing that protocol-level throughput limits generate a non-linear negative feedback loop between network friction and base-layer monetary velocity. Using a verified Transaction Cost Index (TCI) derived from Blockchain.com on-chain data and Hansen's (2000) threshold regression, we identify a definitive structural break at the 90th percentile of friction (TCI ~ 1.63). The analysis reveals a bifurcation in network utility: while the network exhibits robust velocity growth of +15.44% during normal regimes, this collapses to +6.06% during shock regimes, yielding a statistically significant Net Utility Contraction of -9.39% (p = 0.012). Crucially, Instrumental Variable (IV) tests utilizing Hashrate Variation as a supply-side instrument fail to detect a significant relationship in a linear specification (p=0.196), confirming that the velocity constraint is strictly a regime-switching phenomenon rather than a continuous linear function. Furthermore, we document a "Crypto Multiplier" inversion: high friction correlates with a +8.03% increase in capital concentration per entity, suggesting that congestion forces a substitution from active velocity to speculative hoarding.</description>
