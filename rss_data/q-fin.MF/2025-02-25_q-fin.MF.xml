      <title>Risk Measures for DC Pension Plan Decumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the developed world replaces Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans with Defined Contribution (DC) plans, there is a need to develop decumulation strategies for DC plan holders. Optimal decumulation can be viewed as a problem in optimal stochastic control. Formulation as a control problem requires specification of an objective function, which in turn requires a definition of reward and risk. An intuitive specification of reward is the total withdrawals over the retirement period. Most retirees view risk as the possibility of running out of savings. This paper investigates several possible left tail risk measures, in conjunction with DC plan decumulation. The risk measures studied include (i) expected shortfall (ii) linear shortfall and (iii) probability of shortfall. We establish that, under certain assumptions, the set of optimal controls associated with all expected reward and expected shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves is identical to the set of optimal controls for all expected reward and linear shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves. Optimal efficient frontiers are determined computationally for each risk measure, based on a parametric market model. Robustness of these strategies is determined by testing the strategies out-of-sample using block bootstrapping of historical data.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits for Exponential Hedging in the Brownian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scaling limits of exponential utility indifference prices for European contingent claims in the Bachelier model. We show that the scaling limit can be represented in terms of the \emph{specific relative entropy}, and in addition we construct asymptotic optimal hedging strategies. To prove the upper bound for the limit, we formulate the dual problem as a stochastic control, and show there exists a classical solution to its HJB equation. The proof for the lower bound relies on the duality result for exponential hedging in discrete time.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Limit Order Book Simulation under a Neural Hawkes Process: Application in Market-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an event-driven Limit Order Book (LOB) model that captures twelve of the most observed LOB events in exchange-based financial markets. To model these events, we propose using the state-of-the-art Neural Hawkes process, a more robust alternative to traditional Hawkes process models. More specifically, this model captures the dynamic relationships between different event types, particularly their long- and short-term interactions, using a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. Using this framework, we construct a midprice process that captures the event-driven behavior of the LOB by simulating high-frequency dynamics like how they appear in real financial markets. The empirical results show that our model captures many of the broader characteristics of the price fluctuations, particularly in terms of their overall volatility. We apply this LOB simulation model within a Deep Reinforcement Learning Market-Making framework, where the trading agent can now complete trade order fills in a manner that closely resembles real-market trade execution. Here, we also compare the results of the simulated model with those from real data, highlighting how the overall performance and the distribution of trade order fills closely align with the same analysis on real data.</description>

      <title>The Relative Entropy of Expectation and Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As operators acting on the undetermined final settlement of a derivative security, expectation is linear but price is non-linear. When the market of underlying securities is incomplete, non-linearity emerges from the bid-offer around the mid price that accounts for the residual risks of the optimal funding and hedging strategy. At the extremes, non-linearity also arises from the embedded options on capital that are exercised upon default. In this essay, these convexities are quantified in an entropic risk metric that evaluates the strategic risks, which is realised as a cost with the introduction of bilateral margin. Price is then adjusted for market incompleteness and the risk of default caused by the exhaustion of capital.
  In the complete market theory, price is derived from a martingale condition. In the incomplete market theory presented here, price is instead derived from a log-martingale condition: \begin{equation} p=-\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\mathbb{E}\exp[-\alpha P] \notag \end{equation} for the price $p$ and payoff $P$ of a funded and hedged derivative security, where the price measure $\mathbb{E}$ has minimum entropy relative to economic expectations, and the parameter $\alpha$ matches the risk aversion of the investor. This price principle is easily applied to standard models for market evolution, with applications considered here including model risk analysis, deep hedging and decentralised finance.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of robust optimization problems under drift and volatility uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine optimization problems in which an investor has the opportunity to trade in $d$ stocks with the goal of maximizing her worst-case cost of cumulative gains and losses. Here, worst-case refers to taking into account all possible drift and volatility processes for the stocks that fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of predefined fixed baseline processes. Although solving the worst-case problem for a fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is known to be very challenging in general, we show that it can be approximated as $\varepsilon\to 0$ by the baseline problem (computed using the baseline processes) in the following sense: Firstly, the value of the worst-case problem is equal to the value of the baseline problem plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term. This correction term can be computed explicitly and quantifies how sensitive a given optimization problem is to model uncertainty. Moreover, approximately optimal trading strategies for the worst-case problem can be obtained using optimal strategies from the corresponding baseline problem.</description>

      <title>Pricing and calibration in the 4-factor path-dependent volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the path-dependent volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023), where the instantaneous volatility is a linear combination of a weighted sum of past returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past squared returns. We discuss the influence of an additional parameter that unlocks enough volatility on the upside to reproduce the implied volatility smiles of S\&amp;P 500 and VIX options. This PDV model, motivated by empirical studies, comes with computational challenges, especially in relation to VIX options pricing and calibration. We propose an accurate \emph{pathwise} neural network approximation of the VIX which leverages on the Markovianity of the 4-factor version of the model. The VIX is learned pathwise as a function of the Markovian factors and the model parameters. We use this approximation to tackle the joint calibration of S\&amp;P 500 and VIX options, quickly sample VIX paths, and price derivatives that jointly depend on S\&amp;P 500 and VIX. As an interesting aside, we also show that this \emph{time-homogeneous}, low-parametric, Markovian PDV model is able to fit the whole surface of S\&amp;P 500 implied volatilities remarkably well.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of semi-Markov modulated perpetuity and some related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>
