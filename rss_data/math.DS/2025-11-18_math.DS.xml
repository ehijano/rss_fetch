      <title>Double flip bifurcations in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new bifurcation in Hamiltonian systems, which we call the double flip bifurcation. The Hamiltonian depends on two parameters, one of which controls the double flip bifurcation. The result of the bifurcation is the occurrence of two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations with respect to the other parameter. The two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations are simultaneous with respect to the first parameter, and are connected by a curve-segment of singular points. We find a normal form for Hamiltonians describing systems going through double flip bifurcations, and compute said normal form for some examples.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of the stable norm and Mather's {\beta}-function for geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate rigidity phenomena associated to the stable norm and Mather's $\beta$-function for Riemannian geodesic flows on closed manifolds. Given two metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$, we compare these objects pointwise at individual homology classes. Our main result establishes that if Mather's $\beta$-function (or the stable norm) of $g_2$ at a non-zero homology class h equals that of $g_1$ at $h$ multiplied by a suitable factor determined by the metrics, then the two metrics are homothetic on the Mather set of homology h associated to $g_1$. In the case of conformally equivalent metrics, this yields a pointwise criterion for homothety on the projected Mather set. Some consequences are discussed, including a pointwise rigidity result on the 2-torus implying that if a metric has the same Mather's $\beta$-function at some non-zero homology class as a normalized flat metric in the same conformal class, then the metric must be flat. This result can be considered a pointwise version of a similar global result by Bangert. Finally, an extension of these results to Ma\~n\'e's perturbations of general Tonelli Lagrangians is discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of shadowing for linear operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one of the fundamental notions in dynamical systems, the shadowing of invertible (bounded and linear) operators on a Hilbert space. Although the problem of finding a spectral characterization for shadowing has been in the focus of the research for a long time, spectral criteria are available only for rather special classes of invertible operators. In this paper, we give a complete spectral characterization for the shadowing of an arbitrary invertible operator $T$ on a complex Hilbert space. It is shown that $T$ has the shadowing property if and only if its right spectrum is disjoint from the unit circle in the complex plane. As a consequence, the shadowing property for $T$ is equivalent to the uniform expansivity of its adjoint operator.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of measures of maximal entropy for smooth saddle surface endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ local diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces whose topological entropy is larger than the logarithm of their degree admit a finite number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy. To do this, we construct families of rectangles, with a nice geometry, displaying a Markov property. We then analyze the behavior of the iterates of unstable curves intersecting these rectangles, using Yomdin theory.</description>

      <title>Robust heterodimensional cycles of co-index two via split blending machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider diffeomorphisms $f$ with heterodimensional cycles of co-index two, associated with saddles $P$ and $Q$ having unstable indices $\ell$ and $\ell+2$, respectively. In a partially hyperbolic setting, where a two-dimensional center direction and strong invariant manifolds are defined, we introduce the class of \emph{non-escaping cycles}, where the strong stable manifold of $P$ and the strong unstable manifold of $Q$ are involved in the cycle. This configuration guarantees the existence of orbits that remain in a neighbourhood of the cycle.
  We show that such diffeomorphisms $f$ can be $C^1$ approximated by diffeomorphisms exhibiting simultaneously $C^1$ robust heterodimensional cycles of co-indices one and two, encompassing all possible combinations among hyperbolic sets of unstable indices $\ell$, $\ell+1$, and $\ell+2$.
  The proof relies on the construction of \emph{split blending machines}. This tool extends Asaoka's blending machines to a partially hyperbolic setting, providing a mechanisms to generate and control robust intersections within a two-dimensional central bundle.
  We also present simple dynamical settings where such cycles occur, namely skew product dynamics with surface fiber maps. Non-escaping cycles also appear in contexts such as Derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms and matrix cocycles on $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Place n nodes on the unit circle and connect some pairs with springs that pull connected nodes toward each other. Which graphs always drive all nodes to converge to a single point, no matter where they start? This is known as the global synchronization problem of the Kuramoto model and is closely tied to the benign nonconvexity of its synchronization landscape. In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry.</description>

      <title>First return systems for some continued fraction maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Calta, Kraaikamp and the author: For all $n\ge 3$, each member of their one-parameter family of interval maps, denoted $T_{3,n,\alpha}$, has its `first expansive return map' of natural extension given by the first return map under the geodesic flow to a section of the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic surface uniformized by the underlying Fuchsian group $G_{3,n}$.
  To achieve the proof, we first prove the corresponding result for analogous one-parameter families related to the Hecke triangle Fuchsian group $G_{2,n}$. A direct comparison per $n$ of the $\alpha=1$ planar domains allows the Hecke group setting to provide sufficient information to prove the conjecture.
  We also give details about the entropy functions for the Hecke triangle Fuchsian group maps, $\alpha \mapsto h(T_{2,n,\alpha})$. Each is continuous on $(0,1)$, increasing on $(0,1/2)$, decreasing on $(1/2,1)$, with a central interval of constancy. We give precise formulas for the end points of the central intervals and also give precise formulas for the maximal entropy per family. For fixed $\alpha$, the entropy of $T_{2,n,\alpha}$ goes to zero as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Stability of Non-Hyperbolic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In families of unfoldings we find codimension one laminations consisting of maps exibiting an invariant, non-hyperbolic Cantor set containing a Collet-Eckmann point whose orbit is dense in the set. The topology of this Cantor set remains unchanged along the leaves of the lamination, ensuring codimension one stability. Furthermore, within this lamination we identify a sublamination whose leaves contain maps with infinitely many sinks accumulating on the non-hyperbolic Cantor set containing the Collet-Eckmann point. These results provide a new perspective on the stability of chaotic non-hyperbolic dynamics in two-dimensional systems and reveal surprising coexistence phenomena that highlight the richness and complexity of such dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the multiplier spectrum of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results on multiplier spectrum for polynomials. We provide a detailed proof of the theorem stating that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective on the moduli space of polynomials. We obtain a description of the non-injective locus of the multiplier spectrum morphism for polynomials of all degrees $d\geq2$. Roughly speaking, non-injectivity implies intertwining, as it signifies the equivalence of polynomials or Ritt moves, except at isolated points and up to iteration. We investigate the relation between Ritt moves and the multiplier spectrum over arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic integral points for affine dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of $f$-preperiodic cyclotomic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This is a higher-dimensional generalization of a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for all dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, regarding "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. As applications, we also apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of H\'enon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</description>

      <title>Structural Asymmetry and Rigidity of Bounded Solutions for a Parametrized Complex Linear Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of parametrized non-homogeneous linear complex differential equations on $[1,\infty)$, depending on a complex parameter $w$ in the strip $\{0 &lt; \Re(w) &lt; 1\}$. Their dynamics encodes subtle asymptotic features of a real bounded forcing term. Under a mild integrability condition, we establish a rigidity phenomenon: for every parameter $w$ with $\Re(w) \in (0,1)\setminus\{\tfrac12\}$, the two solutions corresponding respectively to $w$ and $1-\bar w$, both taken with initial condition $1$, cannot be simultaneously bounded on $[1,+\infty)$. This result provides an answer to the Dynamical Conjecture formulated in [arXiv:2112.05521] and highlights a structural asymmetry in the solutions' dependence on the complex parameter, thereby contributing to a better understanding of the qualitative behavior of this class of differential systems.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/\Lambda$ improve under convolution by $\mu$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality in simple Lie algebras which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit and extend the method introduced by Lins Neto, Sad and Sc\'{a}rdua for detecting the non-existence of invariant algebraic curves other than some prescribed invariant nodal curve. We prove that, under the existence of a suitable example, the space of polynomial vector fields whose elements have the prescribed curve as their unique invariant algebraic curve is residual and of full measure. We apply this framework to Kolmogorov vector fields, showing that generically the coordinate axes are the unique invariant algebraic curves. Finally, we also refine existing characterizations related to Hilbert's 16th problem, showing that if there exists a bound for the number of limit cycles of a vector field of degree n, then it can be attained by a vector field without algebraic limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Degree-of-freedom and optimization-dynamic effects on the observability of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of chaotic systems can only produce high-fidelity trajectories when the initial and boundary conditions are well specified. When these conditions are unknown but measurements are available, adjoint-variational state estimation can reconstruct a trajectory that is consistent with both the data and the governing equations. A key open question is how many measurements are required for accurate reconstruction, making the full system trajectory observable from sparse data. We establish observability criteria for adjoint state estimation applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by linking its observability to embedding theory for dissipative dynamical systems. For a system whose attractor lies on an inertial manifold of dimension $d_M$, we show that $m \geq d_M$ measurements ensures local observability from an arbitrarily good initial guess, and $m \geq 2d_M + 1$ guarantees global observability and implies the only critical point on $M$ is the global minimum. We also analyze optimization-dynamic limitations that persist even when these geometric conditions are met, including drift off the manifold, Hessian degeneracy, negative curvature, and vanishing gradients. To address these issues, we introduce a robust reconstruction strategy that combines non-convex Newton updates with a novel pseudo-projection step. Numerical simulations of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation validate our analysis and show practical limits of observability for chaotic systems with low-dimensional inertial manifolds.</description>

      <title>Generalized Evolution Semigroups and $h-$Dichotomies for Evolution Families on Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive theory generalizing exponential decay patterns for evolution processes in Banach spaces. We replace classical exponential bounds with more flexible decay rates governed by an increasing homeomorphism $h$. The core of our approach lies in constructing particular group structures induced by $h$, which allow us to define generalized semigroups on function spaces. We prove that these $h$-semigroups are equivalent to classical evolution semigroups through a natural transformation. Our main result establishes that three fundamental concepts are equivalent: hyperbolicity of the generalized semigroup, dichotomy of the underlying evolution process, and a spectral condition on the generator. This work extends classical dichotomy theory to encompass a wider class of decay patterns, providing new tools for analyzing asymptotic behavior in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Global stabilization and emergence tracking via aquatic control in an age-structured mosquito model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an age-structured, non-autonomous logistic model describing the aquatic and adult stages of the dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes. We propose a biological control strategy targeting the aquatic compartment and implement a tracking control for its emergence. A feedback control law guarantees stabilization of the emergent population density, specifically the global asymptotic stability of the logistic model. Additionally, a feedforward controller combined with feedback is introduced to steer the emergent density toward a time-varying reference trajectory. The analytical findings are corroborated and illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>BlinDNO: A Distributional Neural Operator for Dynamical System Reconstruction from Time-Label-Free data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem for stochastic and quantum dynamical systems in a time-label-free setting, where only unordered density snapshots sampled at unknown times drawn from an observation-time distribution are available. These observations induce a distribution over state densities, from which we seek to recover the parameters of the underlying evolution operator. We formulate this as learning a distribution-to-function neural operator and propose BlinDNO, a permutation-invariant architecture that integrates a multiscale U-Net encoder with an attention-based mixer. Numerical experiments on a wide range of stochastic and quantum systems, including a 3D protein-folding mechanism reconstruction problem in a cryo-EM setting, demonstrate that BlinDNO reliably recovers governing parameters and consistently outperforms existing neural inverse operator baselines.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any indeterminate Hamburger moment problem there exists an infinite family of analytic densities with finite (Shannon) entropy. This shows that the maximal entropy density g_{hmax} among the densities to the moment problem has finite entropy. The result is illustrated by the Al-Salam--Carlitz moment problem.</description>

      <title>X-VMamba: Explainable Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication</description>

      <title>On Boundedness of Quadratic Dynamics with Energy-Preserving Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundedness is an important property of many physical systems. This includes incompressible fluid flows, which are often modeled by quadratic dynamics with an energy-preserving nonlinearity. For such systems, Schlegel and Noack proposed a sufficient condition for boundedness utilizing quadratic Lyapunov functions. They also propose a necessary condition for boundedness aiming to provide a more complete characterization of boundedness in this class of models. The sufficient condition is based on Lyapunov theory and is true. Our paper focuses on this necessary condition. We use an independent proof to show that the condition is true for two dimensional systems. However, we provide a three dimensional counterexample to illustrate that the necessary condition fails to hold in higher dimensions. Our results highlight a theoretical gap in boundedness analysis and suggest future directions to address the conservatism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the robustness of the Morse decomposition for the global attractor of the Chafee-Infante problem with respect to non-local perturbations. Focusing on a non-local perturbation of the diffusion term, we establish that the Morse structure of the local limit problem is preserved as long as the non-local function multiplying the laplacian operator remains close to a positive constant.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's Critical Value for Tonelli Lagrangians on Half Lie-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with a strong right-invariant Riemannian metric. These are right-invariant Lagrangians defined on the tangent bundle of a half-Lie group with quadratic growth on each fiber. The main examples of half-Lie groups are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. We show that the Euler--Lagrange flow exists globally. We then introduce three thresholds of the energy, called the Ma~ne critical values, and prove that under mild regularity and completeness assumptions on the half-Lie group, any two points can be connected by a global Tonelli minimizer above the lowest of these energy thresholds. Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow. This extends the work of Contreras from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to the infinite-dimensional context. Moreover, our results also extend the recent work of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to Euler--Lagrange flows of Tonelli Lagrangians. As an application, we obtain global well-posedness of all Euler--Poincare'e equations associated with Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Acceleration of MPC with Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control but can be too slow for low-latency applications. We present a data-driven framework to accelerate MPC by replacing online optimization with a nonparametric policy constructed from offline MPC solutions. Our policy is greedy with respect to a constructed upper bound on the optimal cost-to-go, and can be implemented as a nonparametric lookup rule that is orders of magnitude faster than solving MPC online. Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of persistence of attractors with smooth boundary for a class of set-valued dynamical systems that naturally arise in the context of random and control dynamical systems, as well as in systems modeling the dynamical propagation of uncertainty. In order to tackle the inherent difficulties associated to the multi-valued structure of such dynamical systems, we introduce a single-valued map, the so-called boundary map, which is a contactomorphism of the unit-tangent bundle of the state space, with the following characteristic property: boundaries of attractors of the set-valued dynamical system correspond in a unique way to invariant Legendrian manifolds of this map. We show how the underlying contact geometry guarantees the smooth persistence of such attractors under perturbations of the set-valued dynamical system, provided that the associated boundary map is normally hyperbolic at the unit normal bundle of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current series of papers is concerned with stochastic stability of monotone dynamical systems by identifying the basic dynamical units that can survive in the presence of noise interference. In the first of the series, for the cooperative and irreducible systems, we will establish the stochastic stability of a dynamical order, that is, the zero-noise limit of stochastic perturbations will be concentrated on a simply ordered set consisting of Lyapunov stable equilibria. In particular, we utilize the Freidlin--Wentzell large deviation theory to gauge the rare probability in the vicinity of unordered chain-transitive invariant set on a nonmonotone manifold. We further apply our theoretic results to the stochastic stability of classical positive feedback systems by showing that the zero-noise limit is a convex combination of the Dirac measures on a finite number of asymptotically stable equilibria although such system may possess nontrivial periodic orbits.</description>

Abstract: We show that every multi-correlation sequence is the sum of a generalized nilsequence and a null-sequence. This proves a conjecture of N. Frantzikinakis. A key ingredient is the reduction of ergodic multidimensional inverse theorems to analogous finitary inverse theorems, offering a new approach to the structure theory of multidimensional Host-Kra factors. This reduction is proven by combining the methods of Tao (2015) with the Furstenberg correspondence principle. We also prove the analogous multidimensional finitary inverse theorem with quasi-polynomial bounds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of \emph{mostly nonuniform sectional
  expanding} (MNUSE) for singular flows which encompasses the
  notions of sectional hyperbolicity, asymptotically sectional and
  multisingular hyperbolicity. We exhibit an example of a $C^1$
  nonuniformly sectional hyperbolic set satisfying MNUSE, which is
  neither sectional hyperbolic nor asymptotically sectional
  hyperbolic.
  Moreover, under some smoothness assumptions together with, either
  the dimension or the sign of Lyapunov exponents along the central
  subbundle, we show that attracting MNUSE sets support a physical/SRB
  measure. This measure is unique if the dynamics is transitive.</description>

      <title>Do triangles matter? Replicating hypergraph disease dynamics with lower-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disease spreading models such as the ubiquitous SIS compartmental model and its numerous variants are widely used to understand and predict the behaviour of a given epidemic or information diffusion process. A common approach to imbue more realism to the spreading process is to constrain simulations to a network structure, where connected nodes update their disease state based on pairwise interactions along the edges of their local neighbourhood. Simplicial contagion models (SCM) extend this to hypergraphs such that groups of three nodes are able to interact and propagate the disease along higher-order hyperedges (triangles). Though more flexible, it is not clear the extent to which the inclusion of these higher-order interactions result in dynamics that are characteristically different to those attained from simpler pairwise interactions. Here, we propose an agent-based model that unifies the classical SIS/SIR compartmental model and SCM, and extends it to allow for interactions along hyperedges of arbitrary order. Using this model, we demonstrate how the steady-state dynamics of pairwise interactions can be made to replicate those of simulations that include higher-order topologies by linearly scaling disease parameters based on a proposed measure of network activity. By allowing disease parameters to dynamically vary over time, lower-order pairwise interactions can be made to closely replicate both the transient and steady-state dynamics of higher-order simulations. We demonstrate that this relationship is robust to misspecification in the assumed higher-order interaction model, and applies to non-clique complex hypergraphs with non-trivial heterogeneous topology. For the latter case, it is found that heterogeneities in hypergraph topology result in weakened approximations of higher-order dynamics by pairwise interactions.</description>

Abstract: A nonautonomous dynamical system $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})=\{(X_{k},T_{k})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}:X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$ along with a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$. In this paper, we study the nonautonomous symbolic dynamical systems and nonautonomous expansive dynamical systems.
  We first study the homogeneous properties of pressures in nonautonomous symbolic systems $(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{m}),\boldsymbol{\sigma})$, and we simplify the formulae of Bowen, packing, lower and upper topological pressures for potentials $\boldsymbol{f}=\{f_{k} \in C(\Sigma_{k}^{\infty}(\boldsymbol{m}),\mathbb{R})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ with strongly bounded variation. Then we apply a law of large numbers to obtain the formulae for the lower and upper measure-theoretic pressures with respect to nonautonomous Bernoulli measures and obtain Bowen equilibrium states and packing equilibrium states for potentials in nonautonomous symbolic systems. Finally, we study the generators in nonautonomous expansive systems $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$, and we obtain that $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is expansive if and only if it has a generator. Moreover, strongly uniformly expansive $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is equisemiconjugate to a subsystem of the nonautonomous symbolic dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulae and topological descriptions of action-minimizing sets for 2-locally potentials of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider ergodic optimization of a symbolic dynamics with uncountable alphabet $[0,1]$ for 2-locally constant potentials with the twist condition, and give explicit formulae of the associated Mather set and the Aubry set. Moreover, we investigate the total disconnectedness of the (quotient) Aubry set, in which case the differentiability of the potential function makes a remarkable difference. Although these results imply that the (quotient) Aubry set is small enough, we give a complete characterization of an analogical object of the Aubry set, called the Ma\~{n}\'e set, and show that it is much larger than the Aubry set so that it contains cubes of any finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in two-dimensional coupling of quadratic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the structure and limitations of equi-M sets in two-dimensional Complex Quadratic Networks (CQNs). In particular, we aim to describe the relationship between the equi-M set and the parameter domains where the critical orbit converges to periodic attractors (pseudo-bulbs). The two-node case serves as a foundational testbed: its analytical tractability enables the identification of critical phenomena and their dependence on coupling, while offering insight into more general principles. The two-node case is also simple enough to allow for explicit coupling conditions that govern phase transitions between synchronized and desynchronized behavior.
  Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study reveals that while the period-1 pseudo-bulb closely tracks the boundary of the equi-M set near its main cusp, this correspondence breaks down for higher periods and in regions supporting coexisting attractors. These discrepancies highlight key differences between single-map and coupled dynamics, where equi-M sets no longer provide a full encoding of system combinatorics. These findings clarify the topological and dynamical behavior of low-dimensional CQNs and point toward a sharp increase in complexity as the number of nodes grows, laying the groundwork for future studies of high-dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate complex surfaces that fiber over Teichm\"uller curves where the generic fiber is a Veech surface. When the fiber has genus one, these surfaces are elliptic fibrations; for higher genus fibers, they are typically minimal surfaces of general type. We compute the topological and complex-geometric invariants of these surfaces via the monodromy action on the mod-$m$ homology of the fiber. We get exact values of the invariants for all known algebraically primitive Teichm\"uller curves.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. Computational efficiency is crucial for scalable reservoir computing, requiring better strategies to reduce training cost. In this work, we uncover a connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. We show that NGRC can be trained without regularization, reducing computational time. Our contributions are twofold. First, merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags, high-degree polynomials, and short length of training data. Second, we evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, singular value decomposition (SVD), and lower-upper (LU) decomposition) for solving the regularized least-squares problem. Our results reveal that SVD-based training achieves accurate forecasts without regularization, being preferable when compared against the other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization (GS) in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators, an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. Besides the SL, we considered a generalization of regular oscillators to higher dimensions and also the Lorenz model as a prototype of chaotic oscillators. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for GS to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to have global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>On $q$-Analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>Choice Paralysis in Evolutionary Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for quasi-periodic Jacobi block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for discrete quasiperiodic Jacobi $d\times d$ block matrices with Diophantine frequencies. The H\"older exponent is shown to be any $\beta$ such that $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/(2\kappa^d)$, where $\kappa^d$ is the acceleration, i.e., the slope of the sum of the top $d$ Lyapunov exponents in the imaginary direction of the phase. This generalizes the H\"older continuity results in the Schr\"odinger operator setting in \cites{GS2,HS1}, and also strengthens them in that setting by covering more Diophantine frequencies. The proof is built on a new scheme for obtaining a local zero count for finite-volume characteristic polynomials from a global one.</description>
