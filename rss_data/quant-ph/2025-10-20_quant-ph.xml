      <title>Stroboscopic Saturation of Multiparameter Quantum Limits in Distributed Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision sensors that exploit uniquely quantum phenomena have been shown to surpass the standard quantum limit of measurement precision. However, in the general scenario where multiple parameters are simultaneously encoded in a quantum probe, while surpassing the standard quantum limit is possible, its practical attainability is severely hindered. This difficulty arises due to the fundamental incompatibility among the optimal measurements required for estimating different parameters. A naturally multiparameter sensing scenario emerges when a network of quantum sensors is spatially distributed, with each individual sensor probing a distinct parameter of interest. The central goal in such a setting is twofold: first, to surpass the standard quantum limit in estimating global properties of the system -- thereby achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity for a given network size -- and second, to explicitly identify the optimal measurement strategies necessary to practically attain this quantum advantage. Here, we analytically demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity for a broad class of distributed quantum probes, including cases where the precision scales quadratically or quartically with the sensing resources. We construct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies that achieve the ultimate precision limits -- namely, saturation of both the Holevo and quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. We then apply our framework to two concrete scenarios: the simultaneous estimation of multiple gravitational accelerations (gravimetry) and coupling strengths across spatially separated locations. Feasibility analyses indicate that the proposed distributed quantum-enhanced sensing schemes are within reach of current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic transport of neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational methods have offered controllable and powerful tools for capturing many-body quantum physics for decades. The recent introduction of expressive neural network quantum states has enabled the accurate representation of a broad class of complex wavefunctions for many Hamiltonians of interest. We introduce a first-principles method for building neural network representations of many-body excited states by adiabatically continuing eigenstates of simple Hamiltonians into the strongly correlated regime. With controlled access to the full many-body gap, we obtain accurate estimates of critical exponents. Successive eigenstate estimates can be run entirely in parallel, enabling precise targeting of excited-state properties without reference to the rest of the spectrum, opening the door to large-scale numerical investigations of universal properties of entire phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Advances in Quantum Genetic Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Genetic Algorithms (QGAs) are an emerging field of multivariate quantum optimization that emulate Darwinian evolution and natural selection, with vast applications in chemistry and engineering. The appropriate application of fitness functions and fitness selection are the problem-encoding step and the slowest step in designing QGAs for specific physical applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of these crucial steps. Our survey maps cases of quantum advantage, classifies and illustrates QGAs and their subroutines, and discusses the two main physical problems tackled by QGAs: potential energy minimization of particles on a sphere, and molecular eigensolving. We conclude that the encoding used by the Thomson problem is a decisive step toward the use of QGAs in a variety of physical applications, while Grover's search as a selection step in Reduced QGAs is the main driver of quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Interrelation of Non-Classicality, Entropy, Irreversibility and Work extraction in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of non-classical volume, von Neumann entropy, entropy production, and ergotropy is investigated in various open quantum systems. Two categories of open quantum system models are utilized: spin-spin and spin-boson interaction models. The spin-spin interaction models include the quantum collision and central spin models. On the other hand, the spin-boson interaction models consist of non-Markovian amplitude damping channel, Markovian generalized amplitude damping channel, and the Jaynes-Cummings model. Across these various open quantum systems, universal interrelations emerge, where the non-classical volume shows contrasting evolution with entropy, and entropy production contrasts with ergotropy. The initial state of the reservoir in these open quantum systems is shown to have an impact on these interrelations. These findings establish an interesting link between quantum information and the thermodynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Elegant Joint Measurement is Non-Classical in the Triangle Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When quantum systems are shared by multiple parties in a network, the measurement outcomes of the parties can exhibit non-classical correlations, i.e., correlations that cannot be obtained if the parties shared classical systems instead. This phenomenon is known as quantum nonlocality and is typically demonstrated in the Bell scenario. However, the Bell scenario is fundamentally simpler to investigate than general networks, since the latter come with non-convex optimization problems that are often intractable. The triangle network is one of the simplest networks exhibiting this non-convexity due to the presence of three independent sources. Although some special cases of quantum nonlocality are known in the triangle network, general methods to certify classical incompatibility are still lacking, which suggests that our understanding of networks is still rather limited. For instance, the Elegant Joint Measurement (EJM) distribution is a simple and highly-symmetric outcome distribution that can be obtained with quantum systems and measurements in the triangle network. This distribution was conjectured to be non-classical eight years ago. In this article, we provide the first proof of non-classicality of the EJM distribution. To do so, we show how to combine inflation, a causal inference technique, with powerful symmetry reductions and Frank-Wolfe algorithms for large-scale optimization. We then use these methods to obtain computer-assisted proofs of non-classicality in exact arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits to Cat-Code Qubits from Chaos-Assisted Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that chaos-assisted tunneling (CAT) imposes an intrinsic limit to the protection of Kerr-cat qubits. In the static effective description, tunneling between the quasi-degenerate cat states can be exponentially suppressed, ensuring long lifetimes. However, our Floquet analysis reveals that when the nonlinearities increase, chaotic states mediate tunneling between the cat states, producing large quasi-energy splittings. We compute tunneling rates using both full quantum simulations and semiclassical WKB theory, finding quantitative agreement and confirming that the splittings are directly linked to chaos. These results provide the first evidence of CAT in the Kerr-cat qubit and demonstrate that chaos sets a fundamental bound on the coherence of dynamically protected superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Gap Engineering in Tantalum-Alloy-Based Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics in local Lindbladians with chaotic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical consequences of having a spectrum that satisfies random matrix theory (RMT) for generic Lindbladians, and compare its consequences for spatially local and completely random Lindblad dynamics in one spatial dimension. We find that Lindbladians whose spectrum is described by RMT exhibit quasi-universal early-time dynamics for quantities non-linear in the density matrix, in the sense that for generic, highly entangled initial states, the early time evolution is independent of the choice of initial state. We numerically investigate how locality generically imposes constraints on the size-dependence of Lindblad eigenoperators. This size dependence implies that linear observables, such as expectation values of local operators, are highly sensitive to eigenmodes outside the bulk of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, and plays a central role in limiting operator growth in the presence of dissipation. We find that when single-site dissipation dominates, an operator's decoherence scales approximately linearly with its Pauli weight, even in the presence of 2-site jump operators. When two-site only dissipation dominates, however, this generic trend in operator size can be violated, leading to long-lived high Pauli-weight operators.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Discovery of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Through Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction code discovery has relied on algebraic constructions with predetermined structure or computational brute-force search lacking mechanistic interpretability. We introduce a game-theoretic framework that recasts code optimization as strategic interactions between competing objectives, where Nash equilibria systematically generate codes with desired properties. Applied to graph state stabilizer codes, the framework discovers codes across six distinct objectives -- distance maximization, hardware adaptation, rate-distance optimization, cluster-state generation, surface-like topologies, and connectivity enhancement -- through objective reconfiguration rather than algorithm redesign. Game dynamics spontaneously generate a $[\![15,7,3]\!]$ code with bipartite cluster-state structure enabling measurement-based quantum computation while maintaining distance $d=3$, achieving 40\% overhead reduction versus surface codes at equivalent distance. Equilibrium analysis provides transparent mechanistic insights connecting strategic topology to code parameters, opening research avenues at the intersection of game theory, optimization, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum Voting Protocol for Centralized and Distributed Voting Based on Phase-Flip Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum voting protocol that leverages quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve secure, anonymous voting in both centralized and distributed settings. Our approach utilizes phase-flip encoding on entangled candidate states, where votes are recorded as controlled phase operations conditioned on voter identity registers. The protocol employs a simplified tallying mechanism based on candidate register measurements. We provide comprehensive mathematical formulations for a centralized single-machine model suitable for local voting systems, and a distributed quantum channel model enabling remote voting with enhanced security through entanglement verification. The efficiency of the protocol stems from its use of basic quantum gates (Hadamard and controlled-Z) and its ability to count votes through quantum measurements rather than iterative classical counting. We demonstrate the practicality of the protocol through examples with 4 voters (2 candidates) and 8 voters (3 candidates), showing exact probability preservation and correct vote tallying. The protocol ensures voter anonymity through quantum superposition, prevents double-voting through entanglement mechanisms, and can offer speedup potential for large-scale elections.</description>

      <title>Trust Region Bayesian Optimization of Annealing Schedules on a Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) is a practical model of adiabatic quantum computation, already realized on hardware and considered promising for combinatorial optimization. However, its performance is critically dependent on the annealing schedule due to hardware decoherence and noise. Designing schedules that account for such limitations remains a significant challenge. We propose a trust region Bayesian optimization (TuRBO) framework that jointly tunes annealing time and Fourier-parameterized schedules. Given a fixed embedding on a quantum processing unit (QPU), the framework employs Gaussian process surrogates with expected improvement to balance exploration and exploitation, while trust region updates refine the search around promising candidates. The framework further incorporates mechanisms to manage QPU runtime and enforce feasibility under hardware constraints efficiently. Simulation studies demonstrate that TuRBO consistently identifies schedules that outperform random and greedy search in terms of energy, feasible solution probability, and chain break fraction. These results highlight TuRBO as a resource-efficient and scalable strategy for annealing schedule design, offering improved QA performance in noisy intermediate-scale quantum regimes and extensibility to industrial optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Second-order discretization of Dyson series: iterative method, numerical analysis and applications in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general strategy to discretize the Dyson series without applying direct numerical quadrature to high-dimensional integrals, and extend this framework to open quantum systems. The resulting discretization can also be interpreted as a Strang splitting combined with a Taylor expansion. Based on this formulation, we develop a numerically exact iterative method for simulation system-bath dynamics. We propose two numerical schemes, which are first-order and second-order in time step $\Delta t$ respectively. We perform a rigorous numerical analysis to establish the convergence orders of both schemes, proving that the global error decreases as $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ for the first- and second-order methods, respectively. In the second-order scheme, we can safely omitted most terms arising from the Strang splitting and Taylor expansion while maintaining second-order accuracy, leading to a substantial reduction in computational complexity. For the second-order method, we achieves a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^3 2^{2K_{\max}} K_{\max}^2)$ and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^2 2^{2K_{\max}} K_{\max})$ where $M$ denotes the number of system levels and $K_{\max}$ the number of time steps within the memory length. Compared with existing methods, our approach requires substantially less memory and computational effort for multilevel systems ($M\geqslant 3$). Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the validity and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Investigating the performance of RPM JTWPAs by optimizing LC-resonator elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant phase-matched Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (RPM JTWPAs) play a key role in quantum computing and quantum information applications due to their low-noise, broadband amplification, and quadrature squeezing capabilities. This research focuses on optimizing RPM JTWPAs through numerical optimization of parametrized resonator elements to maximize gain, bandwidth and quadrature squeezing. Our results show that optimized resonators can increase the maximum gain and squeezing by more than 5 dB in the ideal noiseless case. However, introducing the effects of loss through a lumped-element model reveals that gain saturates with increasing loss, while squeezing modes degrade rapidly, regardless of resonator optimization. These results highlight the potential of resonator design to significantly improve amplifier performance, as well as the challenges posed by current fabrication technologies and inherent losses.</description>

      <title>Capturing Protein Free Energy Landscape using Efficient Quantum Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein folding is one of the age-old biological problems that refers to the mechanism of understanding and predicting how a protein's linear sequence of amino acids folds into its specific three dimensional structure.This structure is critical, as a protein's functionality is inherently linked to its final folded form. Misfolding can lead to severe diseases such as Alzheimer's and cystic fibrosis, highlighting the biological and clinical importance of understanding protein folding mechanisms. This work presents a novel turn based encoding optimization algorithm for predicting the folded structures of peptides and small proteins. Our approach builds upon our previous research, where our objective function focused on hydrophobic collapse, a fundamental phenomenon underlying the protein folding process. In this work, we extend that framework by not only incorporating hydrophobic interactions but also including all non bonded interactions modeled using the Miyazawa Jernigan potential. We constructed a Hamiltonian from the defined objective function that encodes the folding process on a three dimensional face centered cubic lattice, offering superior packing efficiency and a realistic representation of protein conformations. This Hamiltonian is then solved using classical and quantum solvers to explore the vast conformational space of proteins. To identify the lowest-energy folded configurations, we utilize the Variational Quantum Eigensolver implemented on IBM 133 qubit hardware. The predicted structures are validated against experimental data using root mean square deviation as a metric and compared against classical simulated annealing and molecular dynamics simulation results. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid classical and quantum approaches in advancing protein folding predictions, particularly for sequences with low homology.</description>

      <title>Achieving Sub-Exponential Speedup in Gate-Based Quantum Computing for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quantum-inspired methods based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm have shown strong potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, Grover's algorithm [1] in gate-based quantum computing offers only a quadratic speedup, which remains impractical for large problem sizes. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates SA with Grover's algorithm to achieve sub-exponential speedup, thereby improving its industrial applicability.
  In enzyme fermentation, variables such as temperature, stirring, wait time, pH, tryptophan, rice flour and so on are encoded by 625 binary parameters, defining the space of possible enzyme formulations. We aim to find a binary configuration that maximizes the active ingredient, formulated as a 625-bit QUBO which is generated by historical experiments and AI techniques. Minimizing the QUBO cost corresponds to maximizing the active ingredient. This case study demonstrates that our hybrid method achieves sub-exponential speedup through gate-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Singularity-free dynamical invariants-based quantum control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State preparation is a cornerstone of quantum technologies, underpinning applications in computation, communication, and sensing. Its importance becomes even more pronounced in non-Markovian open quantum systems, where environmental memory and model uncertainties pose significant challenges to achieving high-fidelity control. Invariant-based inverse engineering provides a principled framework for synthesizing analytic control fields, yet existing parameterizations often lead to experimentally infeasible, singular pulses and are limited to simplified noise models such as those of Lindblad form. Here, we introduce a generalized invariant-based protocol for single-qubit state preparation under arbitrary noise conditions. The control proceeds in two-stages: first, we construct a family of bounded pulses that achieve perfect state preparation in a closed system; second, we identify the optimal member of this family that minimizes the effect of noise. The framework accommodates both (i) characterized noise, enabling noise-aware control synthesis, and (ii) uncharacterized noise, where a noise-agnostic variant preserves robustness without requiring a master-equation description. Numerical simulations demonstrate high-fidelity state preparation across diverse targets while producing smooth, hardware-feasible control fields. This singularity-free framework extends invariant-based control to realistic open-system regimes, providing a versatile route toward robust quantum state engineering on NISQ hardware and other platforms exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Boundary Conditions for the qBounce Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrepancies between theory and recent qBounce data have prompted renewed scrutiny of how boundary conditions are implemented for ultracold neutrons bouncing above a mirror in Earth's gravity. We apply the theory of self-adjoint extensions to the linear gravitational potential on the half-line and derive the most general boundary condition that renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. This introduces a single real self-adjoint parameter $\lambda$ that continuously interpolates between the Dirichlet case and more general (Robin-type) reflecting surfaces.
  Building on this framework, we provide analytical expressions for the energy spectrum, eigenfunctions, relevant matrix elements, and a set of sum rules valid for arbitrary $\lambda$. We show how nontrivial boundary conditions can bias measurements of $g$ and can mimic or mask putative short-range ''fifth-force''. Our results emphasize that enforcing self-adjointness-and modeling the correct boundary physics-is essential for quantitative predictions in gravitational quantum states. Beyond neutron quantum bounces, the approach is broadly applicable to systems where boundaries and self-adjointness govern the observable spectra and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexification transition driven by a single non-Hermitian impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian bulk systems and their sensitivity to boundary conditions have been extensively studied, how a non-Hermitian boundary affects the entanglement structure of Hermitian critical systems remains largely unexplored. Here we present a fully analytical framework by exactly solving a Hermitian gapless chain with a single non-Hermitian impurity acting as a non-Hermitian boundary. When the entanglement cut is placed at the impurity, we uncover a sharp \emph{entanglement complexification transition}: the logarithmic entanglement entropy retains its scaling form, but the effective central charge evolves from real to complex values, accompanied by a spectral collapse of the correlation matrix. We demonstrate that the real regime follows analytic continuation from a unitary defect conformal field theory (CFT), whereas the complex regime lies entirely beyond this framework. For the latter, we derive an analytical formula in perfect agreement with numerics. Our results reveal that a single non-Hermitian impurity can drive a Hermitian critical system into a nonunitary defect-CFT phase, establishing a rare analytically solvable platform for boundary non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Fisher discord as a quantifier of quantum complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two classically equivalent expressions of mutual information of probability distributions (classical bipartite states) diverge when extended to quantum systems, and this difference has been employed to define quantum discord, a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. Similarly, equivalent expressions of classical Fisher information of parameterized probability distributions diverge when extended to quantum states, and this difference may be exploited to characterize the complex nature of quantum states. By complexity of quantum states, we mean some hybrid nature which intermingles the classical and quantum features. It is desirable to quantify complexity of quantum states from various perspectives. In this work, we pursue the idea of discord and introduce an information-theoretic quantifier of complexity for quantum states (relative to the Hamiltonian that drives the evolution of quantum systems) via the notion of Fisher discord, which is defined by the difference between two important versions of quantum Fisher information: the quantum Fisher information defined via the symmetric logarithmic derivatives and the Wigner-Yanase skew information defined via the square roots of quantum states. We reveal basic properties of the quantifier of complexity, and compare it with some other quantifiers of complexity. In particular, we show that equilibrium states (or stable states, which commute with the Hamiltonian of the quantum system) and all pure states exhibit zero complexity in this setting. As illustrations, we evaluate the complexity for various prototypical states in both discrete and continuous-variable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Solver for Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are widely known for their ability to provide probabilistic predictions in supervised machine learning models. Their non-parametric nature and flexibility make them particularly effective for regression tasks. However, training a Gaussian process model using standard methods requires matrix inversions with a cubic time complexity, which poses significant computational challenges for inference on larger datasets. Quantum algorithms, such as the HHL algorithm, have been proposed as solutions that overcome the need for classical matrix inversions by efficiently solving linear systems of equations using quantum computers. However, to gain a computational advantage over classical algorithms, these algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum computers with a large number of qubits, which are not yet available. The Variational Quantum Linear Solver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that solves linear systems of equations by optimizing the parameters of a variational quantum circuit using a classical computer. This method is especially suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, as it does not require many qubits. It can be used to compute the posterior distribution of a Gaussian process by reformulating the matrix inversion into a set of linear systems of equations. We empirically demonstrate that using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver to perform inference for Gaussian process regression delivers regression quality comparable to that of classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized complexity enables the practical solution of generally intractable NP-hard problems when certain parameters are small, making it particularly useful in real-world applications. The study of string problems in this framework has been particularly fruitful, yielding many state-of-the-art classical algorithms that run efficiently in certain parameter regimes contrary to their worst- or average-case performance. Motivated by the dramatic increase in genomic data and its growing computational demands, we initiate the study of the quantum parameterized complexity of the Closest String Problem (CSP) and the related Closest Substring Problem (CSSP). We present three quantum algorithms for the CSP and one for the CSSP. Each algorithm demonstrates improved performance over classical counterparts in specific parameter regimes, highlighting the promise of quantum approaches in structured combinatorial settings. We also derive a conditional lower bound for the CSP with binary alphabets, showing that our first algorithm is tight in its dominant scaling factor.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking non-Clifford gates using only Pauli twirling group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gate benchmarking is unavoidably influenced by state preparation and measurement errors. Randomized benchmarking addresses this challenge by employing group twirling to regularize the noise channel, then provides a characterization of quantum channels that is robust to these errors through exponential fittings. In practice, local twirling gates are preferred due to their high fidelity and experimental feasibility. However, while existing RB methods leveraging local twirling gates are effective for benchmarking Clifford gates, they face fundamental challenges in benchmarking non-Clifford gates. In this work, we solve this problem by introducing the Pauli Transfer Character Benchmarking. This protocol estimates the Pauli transfer matrix elements for a quantum channel using only local Pauli operations. Building on this protocol, we develop a fidelity benchmarking method for non-Clifford gates $U$ satisfying $U^2=I$. We validate the feasibility of our protocol through numerical simulations applied to Toffoli gates as a concrete example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum coupling between free-electrons and photons enables applying quantum optics techniques in electron microscopy. Here, we formulate the elastic electron-photon quantum coupling and its possible implications. Our analysis shows that when an electron traverses the field of an optical cavity, it induces a phase shift onto its confined photonic mode, which can be quantified as a refractive index of a free electron. This principle can be applied to counting electrons in a beam without changing its quantum states. The elastic scattering operator forms an electron-counting dispersive Hamiltonian for electron-photon systems within electron microscope, and it could enable quantum- and sub-shot-noise sensing and imaging at the {\AA}-scale.</description>

      <title>A single optically detectable tumbling spin in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is a widely used technique for analyzing the microscopic structure, local environment and reorientation of atomic and molecular systems. Conventional inductive detection methods typically require to probe more than a billion of electron spins such that single atom motion is hidden through ensemble averaging. While several single spin spectroscopy methods are currently available, they have been so far limited to static systems. Here we demonstrate single spin spectroscopy of a fluorescent tumbling defect in silicon called the G center, behaving as a pseudo-molecule randomly reorienting itself in the crystalline matrix. Using high-resolution spin spectroscopy, we reveal a fine magnetic structure resulting from the spin principal axes jumping between discrete orientations in the crystal. By modeling the atomic reorientation of the defect, we demonstrate that spin tumbling induces variations in the coupling to the microwave magnetic field, enabling position-dependent Rabi frequencies to be detected in coherent spin control experiments. By virtue of its pseudo-molecule configuration, the G center in silicon is a unique quantum system to investigate the mutual interaction between optical, spin and rotation properties in a highly versatile material.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the Husimi and Glauber-Sudarshan functions in terms of complementary Hamiltonian symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact, systematic formulation of the dynamics of the Husimi Q- and Glauber-Sudarshan P-phase space distribution functions expressed in terms of their \emph{complementary} Hamiltonian symbols: Anti-Wick for Q and Wick for P. The resulting evolution equations have a universal leading structure, the classical Liouvillian drift plus terms with higher-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian. For Hamiltonians no higher than quartic in the moduli of the complex phase space variables $\alpha_i$, the higher-order terms reduce to a second-order Fokker-Planck type term with a \emph{traceless} diffusion matrix, thereby clarifying and recovering recent results for such Hamiltonians within a simple star-product framework. We further derive a transparent Ehrenfest theorem for Wick/Anti-Wick symbols of the operators representing dynamical observables. Using these results, we show that a previously reported nonclassical contribution to the Q-function drift for the anharmonic oscillator is an artifact of the quantization scheme used. Our paper consolidates the formulation of the dynamics of the phase space distribution functions using complementary symbols and provides an efficient route to compute and interpret quantum phase space evolution.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Information Processing: A Review of Recent Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum information processing seeks to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum devices by interconnecting multiple quantum processing nodes via classical and quantum communication. This approach extends the capabilities of individual devices, enabling access to larger problem instances and novel algorithmic techniques. Beyond increasing qubit counts, it also enables qualitatively new capabilities, such as joint measurements on multiple copies of high-dimensional quantum states. The distinction between single-copy and multi-copy access reveals important differences in task complexity and helps identify which computational problems stand to benefit from distributed quantum resources. At the same time, it highlights trade-offs between classical and quantum communication models and the practical challenges involved in realizing them experimentally. In this review, we contextualize recent developments by surveying the theoretical foundations of distributed quantum protocols and examining the experimental platforms and algorithmic applications that realize them in practice.</description>

      <title>Solving the 3D Heat Equation with VQA via Remeshing-Based Warm Starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise for solving classically intractable problems such as linear systems and partial differential equations (PDEs). While fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain out of reach, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices enable the exploration of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Among these, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a leading candidate for near-term applications. In this work, we investigate the use of VQAs to solve PDEs arising in stationary heat transfer. These problems are discretized via the finite element method (FEM), yielding linear systems of the form Ku=f, where K is the stiffness matrix. We define a cost function that encodes the thermal energy of the system, and optimize it using various ansatz families. To improve trainability and bypass barren plateaus, we introduce a remeshing strategy which gradually increases resolution by reusing optimized parameters from coarser discretizations. Our results demonstrate convergence of scalar quantities with mesh refinement. This work provides a practical methodology for applying VQAs to PDEs, offering insight into the capabilities and limitations of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Path-Encoded Entanglement Distribution Between Photonic Chips Enabled by Multimode Phase Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable distribution of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, an important resource in quantum technologies, through optical fibre networks is challenging due to the need to maintain coherence across multiple modes. Here we demonstrate the distribution of four-dimensional path-encoded entangled quantum states between photonic chips, enabled by a novel multimode phase stabilisation algorithm. The algorithm utilises the reconfigurability of the integrated photonic circuits to complete one iteration of phase stabilisation in just two measurement rounds for an arbitrary number of modes, and requires no additional hardware to the quantum measurements it enables. As a result, we are able to perform complete quantum state tomography across two chips using the minimum number of local projective measurements to verify the fidelity of the distributed entangled state to be $86\%$ (compared to $8.1\%$ without the phase stabilisation) with an entanglement entropy of $0.995\pm0.002$.</description>

      <title>Fragment, Entangle, and Consolidate: Strong Correlation through Bi-fold Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of strong correlation is quintessential for the exploration of emerging chemical phenomena. While near-term variational quantum algorithms provide a theoretically scalable framework for quantum chemical problems, the accurate simulation of multireference effects remains elusive, hindering progress toward the rational design of novel chemical space. In this regard, we introduce a general and customizable scheme to handle strong electronic correlation, based on problem decomposition, entanglement buildup, and subsequent consolidation. Based on a problem-inspired molecular decomposition, the deployment of Hardware Efficient Ansatz to prepare entangled subsystems ensures efficient construction of a multireference state while concurrently adhering to the hardware topology. The dynamic correlation is subsequently introduced through a unitary coupled cluster framework, with static or dynamic ansatz parametrized by a set of inter-fragment generalized operators, and with the product state spanning various subsystems taken as the reference. The hybrid architecture ensures a judicious deployment of separate ansatze structures for capturing various degrees of correlation in a balanced manner, while concurrently retaining the scalability and flexibility provided by them individually. Over a number of numerical applications on a strongly correlated system, the proposed scheme is shown to be highly accurate, flexible, and robust in unlocking the potential to harness quantum advantage for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Generation of multipartite photonic entanglement using a trapped-ion quantum processing node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to establish entanglement between the nodes of future quantum networks is essential for enabling a wide range of new applications in science and technology. A promising approach involves the use of a powerful central node capable of deterministically preparing arbitrary multipartite entangled states of its matter-based qubits and efficiently distributing these states to surrounding end nodes via flying photons. This central node, referred to as a ``factory node", serves as a hub for the production and distribution of multipartite entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate key functionalities of a factory node using a cavity-integrated trapped-ion quantum processor. Specifically, we program the system to generate genuinely multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three path-switchable photons and verify them using custom-designed entanglement witnesses. These photons can, in the future, be used to establish stored multipartite entanglement between remote matter-based nodes. Our results demonstrate that the well-established techniques for the deterministic preparation of entangled states of co-trapped ion qubits can be used to prepare the same states of traveling photons, paving the way for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum local area networks.</description>

      <title>Globalizing the Carleman linear embedding method for nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carleman embedding method is a widely used technique for linearizing a system of nonlinear differential equations, but fails to converge in regions where there are multiple fixed points. We propose and test three different versions of a global piecewise Carleman embedding technique, based on partitioning space into multiple regions where the center and size of the embedding region are chosen to control convergence. The first method switches between local linearization regions of fixed size once the trajectory reaches the boundary of the current linearization chart. During the transition, the embedding is reconstructed within the newly created chart, centered at the transition point. The second method also adapts the chart size dynamically, enhancing accuracy in regions where multiple fixed points are located. The third method partitions the state space using a static grid with precomputed linearization charts of fixed size, making it more suitable for applications that require high speed. All techniques are numerically tested on multiple integrable and chaotic nonlinear dynamical systems demonstrating their applicability for problems that are completely intractable for the standard Carleman embedding method. Simulations of chaotic dynamical systems such as various types of strange attractors demonstrate the power of the adaptive methods, if a sufficiently low tolerance is imposed. Still, the non-adaptive version of the method, with fixed centers and sizes of the linearization charts, can be faster in simulating dynamical systems while providing similar accuracy and may be more appropriate as the basis of algorithms for future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Worst-Case to Average-Case Reduction for Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worst-case to average-case reductions are a cornerstone of complexity theory, providing a bridge between worst-case hardness and average-case computational difficulty. While recent works have demonstrated such reductions for fundamental problems using deep tools from ad- ditive combinatorics, these approaches often suffer from substantial complexity and suboptimal overheads. In this work, we focus on the quantum setting, and provide a new reduction for the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem that is more efficient, and conceptually simpler than previous constructions. By adapting hardness self-amplification techniques to the quantum do- main, we obtain a quantum worst-case to average-case reduction with improved dependence on the success probability, laying the groundwork for broader applications in quantum fine-grained complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15724v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Qubit Decoherence: Linear vs. Nonlinear Dynamics in the Bloch Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two complementary approaches to the GKSL equation for an open qubit. The first, based on linearity, yields solutions illustrated by mixed states trajectories in the Bloch ball, including non-random asymptotic fixed points, and exceptional points. The second, exploiting the SU(2) symmetry, leads to a nonlinear dynamical system that separates angular dynamics from radial dissipation. This symmetry-based perspective offers a promising route toward generalisation to open qudits.</description>

      <title>Emergence of irreversible decoherence from unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decoherence of superpositions of classically distinguishable states (cat states) is crucial for understanding quantum-to-classical transitions and quantum measurements. So far, decoherence processes of mesoscopic cat states have been demonstrated in several experiments. However, the issue of how the unitary system-reservoir dynamics can lead to irreversible system decoherence remains largely unexplored in experiments. Here we experimentally explore this fundamental issue with a circuit quantum electrodynamics device, where a bus microwave resonator storing a photonic cat state is connected to many nonlinear electronic oscillators. Each of these oscillators that are effectively coupled to the bus resonator serves as one degree of freedom of the reservoir. By gradually increasing the number of the reservoir's degrees of freedom, we find that the revivable quantum coherence progressively decays, owing to the growth in the amount of inerasable information about the system's state encoded in the reservoir. Our results illustrate that irreversible decoherence of a quantum system is an emergent phenomenon, arising from the unitary dynamics involving the system and many of the reservoir's degrees of freedom, which is crucial for the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and classical physics.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for Quantum States: Gauss Curvature and Topology in the Projective Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry and topology are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, but their precise connection in quantum systems remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop an analytical scheme for calculating the curvature of the quantum metric of Bloch bands. Using a gauge-invariant formulation based on eigenprojectors, we construct the full Riemannian geometry of the quantum-state manifold and apply it to a two-dimensional two-band model. We find that the Gauss curvature is constant over regular regions, but the manifold inevitably develops a closed curve of singular points where the metric tensor degenerates. These singularities obstruct the conventional Gauss-Bonnet theorem. By introducing the notion of a front and a signed area form, we derive a generalized Gauss-Bonnet relation that includes a singular curvature term defined along the fold curve. This result establishes a direct, quantized link between the total signed Gauss curvature and the Chern number, providing a unified geometric interpretation of Berry curvature and quantum metric. This framework bridges differential geometry and topological band theory, revealing how singular folds mediate the discrepancy between quantum volume and topological charge.</description>

      <title>A source of heralded atom-photon entanglement for quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15765v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication in quantum networks suffers notoriously from photon loss. Resulting errors can be mitigated with a suitable measurement herald at the receiving node. However, waiting for a herald and communicating the measurement result back to the sender in a repeat-until-success strategy makes the protocol slow and prone to errors from false heralds such as detector dark counts. Here we implement an entanglement herald at the sending node by employing a cascaded two-photon emission of a single atom into two optical fiber cavities: The polarization of one photon is entangled with the spin of the atom, and the second photon heralds entanglement generation. We show that heralding improves the atom-photon entanglement in-fiber efficiency and fidelity to 68(3)% and 87(2)%, respectively. We highlight the potential of our source for noise-limited long-distance quantum communication by extending the range for constant fidelity or, alternatively, increasing the fidelity for a given distance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Path-Transverse Electric Mode Qudit Encoding on an Integrated Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid encodings, where multiple degrees of freedom are used to encode quantum information, can increase the size of the Hilbert space with minimal increase to hardware requirements. We show a reprogrammable integrated photonic device, with multimodal components designed to allow for control over the transverse electric modes. We use this device to generate qudit states entangled in the path and transverse electric mode degrees of freedom. We generate and verify a hyperentangled state with a fidelity of $\mathcal{F}_{\text{HE}} = 67.3 \pm 0.2\%$ and a GHZ$_{4}$-style state with a fidelity of $\mathcal{F}_{\text{GHZ}_{4}} = 85.2 \pm 0.4 \%$. We use our hyperentangled state in a single-copy entanglement distillation protocol, resulting in an average $9.1 \%$ increase in the fidelity of the distilled Bell state for up to a $50\%$ probability of bit flip error. By utilising degrees of freedom which are readily compatible with integrated photonics, our work highlights how this hybrid encoding demonstrates a first step in using the transverse electric mode to reduce the footprint of integrated quantum photonic experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet is still in its infancy, yet identifying scalable and resilient quantum network resource states is an essential task for realizing it. We explore the use of graph states with flexible, non-trivial qubit-to-node assignments. This flexibility enables adaptable engineering of the entanglement topology of an arbitrary quantum network. In particular, we focus on cluster states with arbitrary allocation as network resource states and as a promising candidate for a network core-level entangled resource, due to its intrinsic flexible connectivity properties and resilience to particle losses. We introduce a modeling framework for overlaying entanglement topologies on physical networks and demonstrate how optimized and even random qubit assignment, creates shortcuts and improves robustness and memory savings, while substantially reducing the average hop distance between remote network nodes, when compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Adaptive time Compressed QITE (ACQ) and its geometrical interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of a given Hamiltonian is a computational task of interest in many fields, such as material science, chemistry and even some optimization problems, to name a few. Efficiently preparing ground states for large, strongly correlated systems is a challenging task for both classical and quantum hardware. Drawing from classical optimization methods, e.g. dynamical optimization techniques, one may deduce the spectral decomposition in manner that avoids direct spectral decomposition and is amenable to Trotterization methods. An instance of the latter is ground state preparation by Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE), understood in physical terms as a natural cooling process. Its quantum version QITE (Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution) aims at implementing ITE in a quantum computer. In this paper we introduce a novel QITE algorithm, which leverages underlying geometric properties for algorithm-runtime and circuit depth reduction. This will materialize in the form of an iterative Line Search approach for minimization of energy as well as a Newton's method approach for the deduction of the optimal time-steps for each iteration of QITE. The depth-reduction will be carried out via approximating the resulting unitary operator estimated from the QITE algorithm with unitary operator which is an element of a one-parameter group; making expressible as a single unitary in a quantum circuit. Furthermore, we perform a numerical study to stablish the scaling of fidelities with the different truncation parameters and give gate counts estimates for each.</description>

      <title>Role of exceptional points in the dynamics of the Lindblad Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out of equilibrium dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK), comprising $N$ Majoranas with random all-to-all four-body interactions, minimally coupled to a Markovian bath modeled by the Lindblad formalism, displays intriguing nontrivial features. In particular, the decay rate towards the steady state is a non-monotonic function of the bath coupling $\mu$, and an analogue of the Loschmidt echo for dissipative quantum systems undergoes a first order dynamical phase transitions that eventually becomes a crossover for sufficiently large $\mu$. We provide evidence that these features have their origin in the presence of exceptional points in the purely real eigenvalues of the SYK Liouvillian closest to the zero eigenvalue associated with the steady state. An analytic calculation at small $N$, supported by numerical results for larger $N$, reveals that the value of $\mu \sim 0.1$ at which the exceptional point corresponding to the longest living modes occurs is close to a local maximum of the decay rate. This value marks the start of a region of anomalous equilibration where the relaxation rate diminishes as the coupling to the bath becomes stronger. Moreover, the mentioned change from transition to crossover in the Loschmidt echo occurs at a larger $\mu \sim 0.3$ corresponding with a proliferation of exceptional points in the low energy limit of the Liouvillian spectrum. We expect these features to be generic in the approach to equilibrium in quantum strongly interacting many-body Liouvillians.</description>

      <title>Operator Commutativity Screening and Progressive Operator Block Reordering toward Many-body Inspired Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as a highly promising approach to determine molecular energies and properties within the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The central challenges of this approach lie in the design of an expressive ansatz capable of representing the exact ground state wavefunction while concurrently being efficient to avoid numerical instabilities during the classical optimization. Owing to the constraints of current quantum hardware, the ansatz must remain sufficiently compact while retaining the flexibility to capture essential correlation effects. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic dynamic ansatz construction strategy in which the dominant operator blocks are initially identified through commutativity screening, combined with an energy sorting criteria. Subsequently, the ansatz is progressively expanded in a stepwise manner via iterative operator block reordering. To minimize the overhead, the higher order correlation terms are incorporated via reduced lower-body tensor factorization in each operator block, while the adaptive construction strategy ensures that the optimization is guided along the optimal trajectory to mitigate potential numerical instabilities due to the presence of local traps. Benchmark applications to various molecular systems demonstrate that this strategy of progressive operator-block addition achieves accurate energetics with significantly fewer parameters while efficiently bypassing local traps. Moreover, in strongly correlated regions, such as bond dissociation, the method successfully reproduces the ground state, where other contemporary approaches often fail.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics and energy gap-scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For the completely disordered case $\mu = 0$, we show that the universality class of level statistics depends solely on the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, classifying these Hamiltonians into the Gaussian Orthogonal (GOE), Unitary (GUE), or Symplectic (GSE) ensembles. For couplings with a non-zero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for a energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. We find two distinct regimes: for small locality ($k \ll \sqrt{L}$), we show that the gap closing threshold scales proportionally with the mean coupling $\sigma \sim \mu$, and for large locality ($k \gg \sqrt{L}$) a spectral gap exists as long as $\mu &gt; \sigma$. We analytically derive the expression for this energy gap in the $k \gg \sqrt{L}$ limit. Our work provides a semi-solvable toy model for understanding random matrix universality, universal energy gap scaling, and a foundation for exploring more general properties through systematic modifications and couplings.</description>

Abstract: We apply the correlation matrix Hamiltonian reconstruction technique to the two-dimensional Gutzwiller-projected Fermi sea and {\pi}-flux states on finite-sized square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate no spin Hamiltonian with simple local interaction terms stabilizes such states for finite system sizes. We develop a quantitative assessment of the importance of local interactions to the stabilization of these liquid states. Lastly, we systematically assess arguments for the origin of local terms driving a Gutzwiller-projected ground state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$ replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating $S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.</description>

      <title>IQNN-CS: Interpretable Quantum Neural Network for Credit Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Hermitian photonic filter that harnesses dissipation to selectively isolate a desired topological state. In science and engineering, dissipation is often used to filter incoherent waves, producing a pure coherent output. Here, we apply this principle to topological states, creating a linear filter that effectively isolates a specific topological state regardless of the initial input's coherence properties. This approach creates a dissipation-free topological subspace, where the desired states are preserved and their topological protection is enhanced. Our work provides a versatile and simple method for topological state selection, opening the door to new applications in integrated topological photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework for preparing families of non-stabilizer states, and computing their entanglement entropies, in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons theory. Using the Kac-Moody algebra, we construct Pauli and Clifford operators as path integrals over 3-manifolds with Wilson loop insertions, enabling an explicit topological realization of $W_n$ and Dicke states, as well as their entanglement properties. We further establish a correspondence between Clifford group action and modular transformations generated by Dehn twists on genus-$g$ surfaces, linking the mapping class group to quantum operations. Our results extend existing topological constructions for stabilizer states to include families of non-stabilizer states, improving the geometric interpretation of entanglement and quantum resources in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Solid-State High-Order Harmonic Generation: Emerging Frontiers in Ultrafast and Quantum Light Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a versatile platform for exploring ultrafast and quantum-coherent phenomena in condensed matter. Recent advances reveal Berry-phase and topological effects in harmonic emission, strong-field control of excitons and lattice motion, the generation of nonclassical light states driven by quantum and squeezed fields, and the emergence of orbital-angular-momentum transfer in solid-state high-harmonic generation. Nanostructured and hybrid plasmonic-semiconductor platforms enable enhanced and spectrally tunable HHG, while interferometric and cryogenic setups allow attosecond-resolved phase measurements. On the theoretical side, multiband and topological models incorporating dephasing, propagation, and electron-hole coherence effects have deepened our understanding of the interplay between interband and intraband dynamics. These developments establish solid-state HHG as a bridge between ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum optics, and material science, paving the way toward quantum-engineered attosecond sources and coherent control of light-matter interactions in solids.</description>

      <title>Photonic Exceptional Points in Holography and QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on holographic confining geometries and AdS/QCD, we build the holographic dual of photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and specifically, based on our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches exactly with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We then draw connections between Kaon decay in QCD and non-Hermitian systems, which, by connections to EPs, could shed light on the behavior of strange quarks and the effects of isospin. We then find connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and show how one could be studied using the behavior of the other. Finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a precise second-order EP in a $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields with power-law potentials in quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A homogeneous and isotropic quantum cosmological system (universe) initially filled with a uniform scalar field that has a potential in the power law representation is considered. Depending on the epoch, this scalar field yields barotropic matter in the form of stiff matter, perfect gas, radiation, dust, cosmic strings, domain walls, de Sitter vacuum, or phantom matter. The proposed approach is based on quantum geometrodynamics for the maximally symmetric space. The relevant differential equations for the separate power-law summands of the scalar field potential and the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian constraint equations, which describe the universe that can be viewed as dominated by one form or another of barotropic matter, were obtained. The solutions to these equations have been found in analytical form.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from virtual response to mixed-state holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) serves as a key diagnostic of quantum phases and phase transitions through bipartitions of the full system. However, recent studies on various topological phases of matter show that EE from bipartitions alone cannot effectively distinguish geometric from topological contributions. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined for lower-dimensional \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs), as a response theory characterizing many-body systems via \textit{virtual} deformations of SES geometry and topology. Analytical calculations for cluster states, discrete Abelian gauge theories, and fracton orders reveal distinct subleading SEE terms that sharply differentiate geometric and topological responses. Viewing the reduced density matrix on an SES as a mixed state, we establish a correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, identifying \textit{strong} and \textit{weak} classes. For SESs with nontrivial SEE, weak symmetries act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of the strong ones, forming robust \textit{transparent composite symmetries} (TCSs) that remain invariant under finite-depth quantum circuits and yield \textit{strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking} (SW-SSB). By bridging entanglement, mixed-state and categorical symmetries, holographic principles of topological order, and geometric-topological responses, SEE provides a unified framework that invites further theoretical and numerical exploration of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Beating classical heuristics for the binary paint shop problem with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binary paint shop problem (BPSP) is an APX-hard optimization problem of the automotive industry. In this work, we show how to use the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to find solutions of the BPSP and demonstrate that QAOA with constant depth is able to beat classical heuristics on average in the infinite size limit $n\rightarrow\infty$. For the BPSP, it is known that no classical algorithm can exist which approximates the problem in polynomial runtime. We introduce a BPSP instance which is hard to solve with QAOA, and numerically investigate its performance and discuss QAOA's ability to generate approximate solutions. We complete our studies by running first experiments of small-sized instances on a trapped-ion quantum computer through AWS Braket.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal games play a crucial role in quantum information theory and have numerous applications in certification and cryptographic protocols. Kalai et al. (STOC 2023) introduced a procedure to compile a nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive proof, using a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, and showed that their compilation method preserves the classical bound of the game. Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS 2023) then showed that the quantum bound is preserved for the specific case of the CHSH game. Extending the proof techniques of Natarajan and Zhang, we show that the compilation procedure of Kalai et al. preserves the quantum bound for two classes of games: XOR games and d-outcome CHSH games. We also establish that, for any pair of qubit measurements, there exists an XOR game such that its optimal winning probability serves as a self-test for that particular pair of measurements.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production facility to a multifactory production environment that must manage both regionally dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to the Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). Consequently, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. We employ Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP in our research. In addition to assigning production orders to production sites, production steps are also assigned to these sites. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturing company. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special attention is dedicated to determining the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry</description>

Abstract: Using quantum information geometry, I derive quantum generalizations of the Onsager rate equations, which model the dynamics of an open system near a steady state. The generalized equations hold for a flexible definition of the forces as well as a large class of statistical divergence measures and quantum-Fisher-information metrics beyond the conventional definition of entropy production. I also derive quantum Onsager-Casimir relations for the transport tensors by proposing a general concept of time reversal and detailed balance for open quantum systems. The results establish a remarkable connection between statistical mechanics and parameter estimation theory.</description>

      <title>A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we study the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 &lt; d = o(n^{1/2})$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques -- the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Propelling force from asymmetrically excited quantum vacuum with conventional mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigations show that a time-varying $\delta-\delta'$ mirror gives rise to asymmetrical vacuum radiation on its two sides, enabling one to extract propelling forces from the vacuum fluctuation. In this work, we propose a design of Casimir device to gain propulsions out of vacuum with conventional $\delta$ mirrors. We call this device a ``vacuum propellion'', which is experimentally feasible. It consists of a cavity made up of a perfectly reflective left mirror and a right mirror with time dependent transparency. All particles generated from this propellion are preferentially right-moving, so the cavity obtains a left-pointing propelling force.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Underlying States are incompatible with a Counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- rules out underlying-state models of quantum mechanics (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn establishes an equivalence between compatibility and the existence of such models.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution generalisation for learning quantum channels with low-energy coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When experimentally learning the action of a continuous variable quantum process by probing it with inputs, there will often be some restriction on the input states used. One experimentally simple way to probe a quantum channel is using low energy coherent states. Learning a quantum channel in this way presents difficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low energy inputs but very differently for high energy inputs. They may also act similarly on coherent state inputs but differently on non-classical inputs. Extrapolating the behaviour of a channel for more general input states from its action on the far more limited set of low energy coherent states is a case of out-of-distribution generalisation. To be sure that such generalisation gives meaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to bounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels that act sufficiently similarly on low energy coherent state inputs, one can bound how different the input-output relations are for any (high energy or highly non-classical) input. This proves out-of-distribution generalisation is always possible for learning quantum channels using low energy coherent states, as long as enough samples are used.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary enhanced transfer efficiency in quantum walk search on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of finding an element in an unstructured database is known as spatial search and can be expressed as a quantum walk evolution on a graph. In this article, we modify the usual search problem by adding an extra trapping vertex to the graph, which is only connected to the target element. We study the transfer efficiency of the walker to a trapping site, using the search problem as a case study. Thus, our model offers no computational advantage for the search problem, but focuses on information transport in an open environment with a search Hamiltonian. The walker evolution is a mix between classical and quantum walk search dynamics. The balance between unitary and non-unitary dynamics is tuned with a parameter, and we numerically show that depending on the graph topology and the connectivity of the target element, this hybrid approach can outperform a purely classical or quantum evolution for reaching the trapping site. We show that this behavior is only observed in the presence of an extra trapping site, and that depending on the topology and a tunable parameter controlling the strength of the oracle, a hybrid regime composed of 90% coherent dynamics can lead to either the highest or worst transfer efficiency to the trapping site. We also relate the performance of an hybrid regime to the entropy's decay rate. As the introduction of non-unitary operations may be considered as noise, we interpret this phenomena as a noisy-assisted quantum evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum network protocols depend on the availability of shared entanglement. Given that entanglement generation and distribution are affected by noise, characterization of the shared entangled states is essential to bound the errors of the protocols. This work analyzes the estimation of Bell diagonal states within quantum networks, where operations are limited to local actions and classical communication. We demonstrate the advantages of Bayesian mean estimation over direct inversion and maximum-likelihood estimation, providing analytical expressions for estimation risk and supporting our findings with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering Clock Transitions in Magnetic Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total electronic spin of the metal center. By focusing on the low-lying energy levels using an $S = 1$ spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate their continuous tunability under the Floquet field. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, the energy levels of a clock transition qubit retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further, using second-order Van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory, we derived analytically an effective Hamiltonian, which explicitly shows the dependence of the renormalized zero-field tensor on the driving field. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. Building on this framework, we investigate the emergence and properties of optomechanical limit cycles beyond the constraints of the resolved sideband approximation. By employing a Fokker-Planck formalism originally developed in the context of laser theory and then used in cavity optomechanics, we describe the quantum regime of these limit cycles, offering a more detailed and unified analytical perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a time crystal based on a quantum black-hole laser, where the genuinely spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time observables are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic analogue of the Andreev-Hawking effect, exhibiting anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions. Remarkably, the time-crystal formation is understood in terms of two time operators: one associated to the initial black-hole laser and another associated to the final spontaneous Floquet state.</description>

      <title>Realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) arising from the combination of laser damage attack (LDA) and unambiguous state discrimination (USD). While decoy-state QKD is designed to protect against photon-number-splitting and beam-splitting attacks by accurately estimating the single-photon fraction, it relies on stable attenuation to prepare pulses with fixed mean-photon numbers. An eavesdropper (Eve) can exploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side, effectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security regime. We show that once the alteration exceeds a critical threshold - on the order of 10--20 dB - Eve can implement an efficient USD-based intercept-resend strategy using current off-the-shelf technology, thus obtaining the entire secret key. Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated mean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state statistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further demonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can reduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack. Additionally, we introduce the pseudo-photon-number resolution (PPNR) USD attack, which allows Eve to emulate all observable gains at Bob's side so that she remains fully undetectable even with advanced statistical checks. Our findings emphasize the need for robust safeguards against high-power laser damage in QKD systems, including careful hardware selection, rigorous testing under high-power illumination, and real-time monitoring to ensure the integrity of the decoy-state protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.</description>

      <title>Overhead in Quantum Circuits with Time-Multiplexed Qubit Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When scaling up quantum processors in a cryogenic environment, it is desirable to limit the number of qubit drive lines going into the cryostat, since fewer lines makes cooling of the system more manageable and the need for complicated electronics setups is reduced. However, although time multiplexing of qubit control enables using just a few drive lines to steer many qubits, it comes with a trade-off: fewer drive lines means fewer qubits can be controlled in parallel, which leads to an overhead in the execution time for quantum algorithms. In this article, we quantify this trade-off through numerical and analytical investigations. For standard quantum processor layouts and typical gate times, we show that the trade-off is favorable for many common quantum algorithms $\unicode{x2014}$ the number of drive lines can be significantly reduced without introducing much overhead. Specifically, we show that couplers for two-qubit gates can be grouped on common drive lines without any overhead up to a limit set by the connectivity of the qubits. For single-qubit gates, we find that the serialization overhead generally scales only logarithmically in the number of qubits sharing a drive line. These results are promising for the continued progress towards large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entanglement Swapping in High-Dimensions with only Linear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a fundamental building block for realizing first-generation quantum repeaters, which are essential for building global quantum networks. Current quantum repeater systems still struggle to achieve practical communication rates. High-dimensional (HD) encoding can significantly improve repeater efficiency by boosting information capacity and enhancing noise tolerance and security. However, the experimental demonstration of this protocol so far has been limited only to two-dimensional systems due to the requirement of strong nonlinear interactions. Here, we introduce an efficient linear-optics protocol for HD entanglement swapping that uses ancillary photons and is compatible with arbitrary photonic degrees of freedom (DOFs). We further show that photon-number-resolving detectors substantially enhance the performance of the setup and become especially valuable for dimensions beyond six. For a four-dimensional scenario, we present an experimental design using hyper-entanglement in polarization and time-bin DOFs. This setup resolves the most challenging part of the ancillary photons-based approach, namely the necessary preparation of the ancilla state and analysis of the resulting swapped state.</description>

      <title>Learning with errors may remain hard against quantum holographic attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem underlies modern lattice-based cryptography and is assumed to be quantum hard. Recent results show that estimating entanglement entropy is as hard as LWE, creating tension with quantum gravity and AdS/CFT, where entropies are computed by extremal surface areas. This suggests a paradoxical route to solving LWE by building holographic duals and measuring extremal surfaces, seemingly an easy task. Three possible resolutions arise: that AdS/CFT duality is intractable, that the quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis (QECTT) fails, or that LWE is easier than believed. We develop and analyze a fourth resolution: that estimating surface areas with the precision required for entropy is itself computationally hard. We construct two holographic quantum algorithms to formalize this. For entropy differences of order N, we show that measuring Ryu-Takayanagi geodesic lengths via heavy-field two-point functions needs exponentially many measurements in N, even when the boundary state is efficiently preparable. For order one corrections, we show that reconstructing the bulk covariance matrix and extracting entropy requires exponential time in N. Although these tasks are computationally intractable, we compare their efficiency with the Block Korkine-Zolotarev lattice reduction algorithm for LWE. Our results reconcile the tension with QECTT, showing that holographic entropy remains consistent with quantum computational limits without requiring an intractable holographic dictionary, and provide new insights into the quantum cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>Towards Symmetry-Aware Efficient Simulation of Quantum Systems and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of complex quantum systems remains a central challenge due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space with system size. Tensor network methods have long been established as powerful approximation schemes, and their efficiency can be further enhanced by incorporating physics-informed priors. A prominent example is symmetry: recent progress on $U(1)$-symmetric tensor networks, accelerated on GPUs and scaled to supercomputers, shows how conserved charges induce block-sparse structures that reduce computational cost and enable larger simulations. The same principle extends to general symmetries, inspiring equivariant neural networks in machine learning and guiding symmetry-preserving ansatze in variational quantum algorithms. Beyond symmetry, physics-informed design also includes strategies such as hybrid tensor networks and parallel sequential circuits, which pursue efficiency from complementary principles. This Perspective argues that physics-informed tensor networks, grounded in both symmetry and beyond-symmetry insights, provide unifying strategies for scalable approaches in quantum simulation, computation, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Gravitational Potential and Time Dilation from Non-interacting Systems Coupled to a Global Quantum Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational back-reaction within the Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics by treating time as a quantum degree of freedom. Our model introduces a distinction between global coordinate time, represented as a relational quantum observable, and proper time, measured by internal quantum degrees of freedom of physical systems. By coupling mass-energy with coordinate time through a Wheeler-DeWitt-like constraint, we demonstrate the natural emergence of gravitational time dilation. In the presence of a massive object this agrees with time dilation in a Schwarzchild metric at leading order if the interaction strength is taken to be representative of the gravitational coupling $G$. Additionally, when two particles independently couple to the time coordinate, a Newtonian gravitational interaction arises in the low-energy limit, showing how gravitational potential can emerge from non-interacting quantum systems. Our approach also reveals renormalization features, potentially softening high-energy divergences and suggesting that particles in superposition might introduce quantum corrections to gravitational time dilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic power is essential for reliable grid integration, yet remains difficult due to highly variable irradiance, complex meteorological drivers, site geography, and device-specific behavior. Although contemporary machine learning has achieved successes, it is not clear that these approaches are optimal: new model classes may further enhance performance and data efficiency. We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency. These results show that hybrid quantum models address key challenges in photovoltaic power forecasting and offer a practical route to more reliable, data-efficient energy predictions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics from universal low-lying modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Localization and "classical entanglement'' in the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a property of the system that we have called {\it ``classical entanglement''}. Our main finding is that a quantity defined for our classical system in perfect analogy with the entanglement entropy of quantum ones, and that we have therefore called $S_{\mathrm{ent}}$, grows with the system size $N$ in the localized phase as $S_{\mathrm{ent}}(N) \sim \log(N)$, therefore revealing the presence of subtle non-local correlations between any finite portion of the system and the rest of it. This manifestation of {\it ``classical entanglement''} beautifully captures the lack of system separability in the DNLSE localized phase, revealing how statistical correlations specific to the microcanonical ensemble and non-reproducible in the canonical one, may concur to determine a property totally analogous to the one produced by non-local quantum correlations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a broad class of strongly interacting quantum lattice gases, including the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on macroscopic particle clusters of size $\theta N$, with $\theta\in(0,1)$ and $N$ the total particle number, and we study the quantum probability that such a cluster is transported across a distance $r$ within time $t$. Conventional effective light cone arguments yield a bound of the form $\exp(v t-r)$. We report a substantially stronger bound $\exp(\theta N(vt-r))$, which provides exponential suppression that scales with system size. Our result establishes a universal dynamical large deviation principle: macroscopic suppression of supersonic macroscopic transport (MASSMAT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge--photon and spin--charge coupling-key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we demonstrate that NbTiN nanowire resonators maintain high quality factors around 10^5 after depositing solid neon onto the resonators and subsequently loading electrons onto the neon surface, validating their suitability for electrons-on-neon platforms. Building on these experimental results, we theoretically analyze micromagnet designs and coupling strategies that can enable spin-photon interactions in this platform. Our analysis outlines performance targets for next-generation devices, showing that, at the charge sweet spot, spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit operations and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable with natural neon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. This work explores the application of a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm to MBHB signals. Under certain simplifying assumptions, quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results illustrate the potential reduction in computational costs, while also showing that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. These findings reveal both the potential and the limitations of quantum search for MBHB signals, pointing to the importance of developing more robust and stable search strategies alongside realistic modeling in future work.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy of the measurement record at measurement-dominated criticality and RG flow: A c-theorem for effective central charge and a g-theorem for effective boundary entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two theorems demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease under relevant renormalization group (RG) flow of two quantities, $c_{\text{eff}}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}$ characterizing, respectively, the universal information content of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record for two different types of measurement-dominated criticality. First, we demonstrate the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}$ of $2D$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit that govern the long-distance physics of weakly monitored $2D$ classical critical systems (Baysian inference problems) studied recently in the literature [arXiv:2504.01264; arXiv:2504.12385; arXiv:2504.08888]. In particular, we show that $c_{\text{eff}}$ is $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unmeasured critical system. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem''. In addition, we present an analogous "$g$-effective theorem" demonstrating the decrease under RG flow of the effective "Affleck-Ludwig'' boundary entropy $\ln g_\text{eff}$, quantifying a corresponding contribution to the Shannon entropy for analogous $2D$ $\textit{defect}$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit, which govern the long-distance physics in the problem of performing weak $\textit{quantum}$ measurements on one-dimensional quantum critical ground states. Lastly, we discuss a possible consequence of our theorems for classical systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, according to which, under a certain assumption, and as opposed to problems with measurement-induced randomness, the corresponding universal quantities $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ in the $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit would $\textit{increase}$ under RG flow.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator $J$. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving $J$ offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state $\rho$ and its modular reflection $J\rho J$. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator $J$ captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring molecular supersolidity via exact and mean-field theories: single microwave shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity--absent in cylindrically symmetric systems. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>The Infra-Red Road to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review work in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity, with the following interconnected questions in mind: (i) what is the nature of the vacuum in condensed matter systems, in quantum field theory, and in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and why low-energy theories of quantum gravity are, in our view, the right way to make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>
