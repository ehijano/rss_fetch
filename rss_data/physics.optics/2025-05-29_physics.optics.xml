      <title>Surface plasmon polaritons with extended lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation distance of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on metal nanowires is severely limited by their short lifetime, primarily due to strong metallic losses. In this work, we show that the lifetime-and thus the propagation distance-of SPPs can be significantly extended through the use of Fano resonances. Our FDTD simulations demonstrate that the SPP intensity at a fixed propagation distance can be enhanced by approximately 30 times. Furthermore, this enhancement factor is multiplicative with improvements achieved through other methods. We emphasize that this result represents only a starting point, as no optimization was performed due to limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Record-high-Q AMTIR-1 microresonators for mid- to long-wave infrared nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AMTIR-1 chalcogenide glass has shown its potential for use in thermal imaging systems owing to its low refractive index, thermal resistance and high transparency across the infrared wavelength regime. Here we report a millimeter-scale high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator made of AMTIR-1. The recorded Q-factor has reached $1.2\times10^7$ at 1550~nm, which is almost two-orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values. We characterize the thermal properties, where low thermal conductivity plays an important role in thermal resonance tuning. We further show that AMTIR-1 resonators support anomalous dispersion as well as a low absorption coefficient near the 7~\textmu m wavelength band, thus offering the possibility of providing suitable platforms for mid-infrared, long-wave infrared nonlinear optics including microresonator frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Low-loss, fabrication-tolerant, and highly-tunable Sagnac loop reflectors and Fabry-P\'erot cavities on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present low-loss ($&lt;1.5\%$) and power-efficient Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) on thin-film lithium niobate. To accurately measure low MZI losses, we develop a self-calibrated method using tunable Sagnac loop reflectors (SLRs) to build cavities. Fabry-P\'erot cavities constructed from these fabrication-tolerant SLRs achieve an intrinsic quality factor of $2 \times 10^6$. By implementing thermal isolation trenches, we also demonstrate a $&gt;10\times$ reduction in power consumption for thermo-optic phase shifters, achieving a $\pi$-phase shift ($P_\pi$) with just 2.5 mW. These tunable and efficient components are key for scaling up to complex photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Cavity ringdown spectroscopy at 2 ${\mu}$m wavelength assisted by a comb-locked optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a comb-locked cavity ring-down spectrometer developed for high-precision molecular spectroscopy at 2 ${\mu}$m. It is based on the use of an external-cavity diode laser that is offset-frequency locked to the signal output of a singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator. This latter acts as reference laser, being locked to a self-referenced optical frequency comb, which in turn is stabilized against a GPS-disciplined Rb-clock. The performance of the spectrometer is investigated by probing a pair of N$_2$O transitions belonging to hot vibrational bands. One of these, never observed before, is included in the N$_2$O line list of the ExoMol database. Absolute center frequencies are retrieved with a 1-${\sigma}$ global uncertainty of 108 kHz.</description>

      <title>Trainable dynamical masking for readout-free optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear systems, transforming an input signal into a high-dimensional output feature space, can be used for non-conventional computing. This approach, however, requires a change of system parameters during training rather than coefficients in a software program. We propose here to use available off-the-shelf high-speed optical communication devices and technologies to implement a trainable dynamical mask in addition to or even instead of the traditional readout layer for extreme learning machine-based computing. The computational potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated with both regression and time series prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Optical Key-Enabled Hybrid Cryptography: Merging Diffractive Physics and Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical encryption inherently provides strong security advantages, with hybrid optoelectronic systems offering additional degrees of freedom by integrating optical and algorithmic domains. However, existing optical encryption schemes heavily rely on electronic computation, limiting overall efficiency, while the physical keys are susceptible to damage, compromising both security and system stability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Quasi Periodic Optical Key (QPOK), which combines long range order with short range disorder, enabling enhanced security and robustness against damage within a single platform. By leveraging diffraction symmetry, our design enables optics-driven encryption, effectively shifting the optoelectronic balance toward photonic processing. Moreover, we innovatively apply deep learning to reconstruct the complex optical ciphertext field using only amplitude data and cryptographic keys, simultaneously achieving data compression and improved security. Within this framework, the key space includes continuously tunable parameters such as wavelength, propagation distance, phase modulation, and Q-POK geometry, significantly expanding cryptographic diversity. Our system also demonstrates robust cryptographic reliability by reducing inter-class distances by over 50% and tolerating up to 20% ciphertext loss. Our framework represents a new generation of physically grounded, algorithmically enhanced optical cryptosystems, laying a foundational pathway for scalable, hardware-integrated information security paradigms.</description>

      <title>Integrated thin film lithium niobate mid-infrared modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral range holds great promise for applications such as molecular spectroscopy and telecommunications. Many key molecules exhibit strong absorption features in this range, and free-space optical communication benefits from reduced atmospheric attenuation and low transmission losses in specific wavelength bands spanning from 3 to 14 {\mu}m. Recent progress in MIR photonics has been fuelled by the rapid development of efficient light sources and detectors. However, further advancement is hindered by the lack of low-loss, high-performance integrated photonic platforms and modulators. Lithium niobate on sapphire is a promising candidate, operating across a broad spectral range from 0.4 {\mu}m to 4.5 {\mu}m. We demonstrate a broadband, high-speed lithium niobate on sapphire Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator operating from 3.95 to 4.3 {\mu}m. The device achieves a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz, an extinction ratio of 34 dB, and a half-wave voltage of 22 V.cm, delivering optical output power at the half-milliwatt level. These properties are leveraged to demonstrate data transmission at 10 Gbit/s. The modulator is also used to generate a frequency comb with a width of 80 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate full {\pi}-phase modulation in the MIR, representing a key milestone for integrated MIR photonics. These results establish a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient MIR photonic systems for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Light Extraction and Beam Focusing in GaN LEDs Using Hybrid Metasurface-Distributed Bragg Reflector Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an optimized hybrid design integrating a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and a TiO2 nanocylinder metasurface to enhance light extraction efficiency (LEE) and beam directionality(narrow divergence angle) in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on gallium nitride (GaN).Parametric simulations were used to identify an optimal device architecture.The resulting structure comprises a single-period DBR,which has a thickness of TiO2(dTiO2) equal to forty-six nm and a thickness of SiO2 equal to seventy-sevsen nm,beneath a periodic array of TiO2 nanocylinders (radius is approximately seventy-one nm,height is approximately one handred and eighty-five nm).The DBR reflects guided modes to minimize internal optical losses,while the TiO2 metasurface employs Mie resonance to collimate the emitted light.As a result,the hybrid LED achieves a simulated LEE of 25.67 percent and a beam divergence angle of only 5.7 degree,representing a significant improvement in both efficiency and emission directionality over conventional designs.These findings demonstrate a viable strategy to overcome light trapping and broad angular emission in GaN LEDs,paving the way for high-brightness,highly directional GaN micro-LEDs for advanced display and optical communication applications.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Resolved Higher Order Photon Statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photon statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably, the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. By the coupling of the detection scheme to a spectrometer, studying different bandwidths within the emission revealed that shorter wavelengths increased nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear behavior, indicating a wavelength dependent efficiency in the generation of the SPDC. We employ the use of a four detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss Interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam, where the idler serves as the herald. The measured statistics were found to be best described by a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a characteristic of thermal light sources. The detection and characterization of complex light sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology, quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Correlation of Spacetime Fluctuations in Laser Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\'erot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book chapter gives a selective review of physical implementations and applications of superoscillations and associated phenomena. We introduce the field by reviewing simple examples of superoscillations and showing how their existence naturally follows from the real part of the quantum mechanical weak value, which the parallel phenomena of supergrowth naturally follows from the imaginary part. Focusing on electromagnetic applications, we review the topics of superoscillation and supergrowth in speckle, creating superoscillating hot spots with patterned filters, superspectroscopic discrimination of two molecules, noise mitigation and the engineering of super behavior in point spread functions for the purpose of optical superresolution. We also cover a variety of different methods for creating superoscillatory and supergrowing functions, reviewing both mathematical and physical ways to create this class of functions, and beyond. Promising directions for future research, including superoscillations in other wave phenomena, super radar, and generalized super-phenomena in quantum physics, are outlined.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Lineshape Analysis for Arbitrary Inhomogeneity in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for a quantum-well-exciton resonance with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Optical Spintronics: Towards Optical Communication Without Energy Transfer</title>

Abstract: Energy, momentum, and angular momentum are fundamental properties tied to the symmetries of space and time, with photons and other elementary particles acting as carriers of these quantities. In most optical and optoelectronic devices, energy transfer is crucial, but it often results in undesirable energy absorption. Moreover, non-reciprocal elements such as optical diodes and circulators are difficult to implement in photonics, as they typically require time-dependent perturbations, nonlinear effects, or external magnetic fields. This presents a significant barrier to the development of efficient, compact photonic technologies. We introduce the concept of optical spin current, wherein spin angular momentum is transferred by an electromagnetic field without accompanying energy transfer. This phenomenon is analogous to electron spin currents, where spin is decoupled from charge flow. Building on this principle, we propose optical spin diode and circulator -- devices that enable unidirectional propagation of spin currents while maintaining bidirectional energy flow, thus preserving reciprocity. Furthermore, we demonstrate asymmetric spin transfer between quantum dots mediated by the optical spin diode, highlighting the potential for novel optical spintronic functionalities. These findings lay the foundation for devices that leverage optical spin transfer, opening new avenues for advancements in optical spintronics.</description>

      <title>SP2RINT: Spatially-Decoupled Physics-Inspired Progressive Inverse Optimization for Scalable, PDE-Constrained Meta-Optical Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DONNs leverage light propagation for efficient analog AI and signal processing. Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop optimizes implementable metasurfaces via adjoint methods, but is computationally prohibitive and unscalable. To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.

      <title>High gain squeezing in lossy resonators: an asymptotic field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for describing nonlinear electromagnetic interactions in integrated photonic devices utilizing an asymptotic-in/out field formalism. Our method expands upon previous continuous wave asymptotic treatments by describing the evolution non-perturbatively for an arbitrary pulsed input. This is presented in the context of a squeezing interaction within an integrated microring resonator side coupled to an input/output waveguide, but is readily generalizable to other integrated structures, while including a variety of (non-squeezing) third-order interactions. An example of a single-pump, non-degenerate squeezing interaction is studied, which is shown to match well with standard coupled-mode treatments for high-finesse resonators, as well as previous perturbative treatments dealing with the generation of pairs with low probability.</description>

      <title>Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic material non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a Floquet cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation threshold. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of \(10^6\), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</description>
