      <title>Convergence of generalized MIT bag models to Dirac operators with zigzag boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the resolvent convergence of generalized MIT bag operators to Dirac operators with zigzag type boundary conditions. We prove that the convergence holds in strong but not in norm resolvent sense. Moreover, we show that the only obstruction for having norm resolvent convergence is the existence of an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity for the limiting operator. More precisely, we prove the convergence of the resolvents in operator norm once projected into the orthogonal of the corresponding eigenspace.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Kirchhoff Problems with Nonlinear Neumann Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider degenerate Kirchhoff-type equations of the form \[-\phi(\Xi(u)) \left(\mathcal{A}(u)+|u|^{p-2}u\right) = f(x,u)\quad \text{in } \Omega,\] \[\phantom{aaiaaaaaaaaa}\phi (\Xi(u)) \mathcal{B}(u) \cdot \nu = g(x,u) \quad \text{on } \partial\Omega,\] where $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the double phase operator given by \begin{align*} \mathcal{A}(u)=\operatorname{div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + \mu(x) |\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u \right)\quad \text{for }u\in W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega), \end{align*} $\nu(x)$ is the outer unit normal of $\Omega$ at $x \in \partial\Omega$, \[\mathcal{B}(u)=|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + \mu(x) |\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u,\] \[\phantom{aaaiaaaa}\Xi(u)= \int_\Omega \left(\frac{|\nabla u|^p+|u|^p}{p}+\mu(x) \frac{|\nabla u|^q}{q}\right)\,\mathrm{d} x,\] $1&lt;p&lt;N$, $p&lt;q&lt;p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, $0 \leq \mu(\cdot)\in L^\infty(\Omega)$, $\phi(s) = a + b s^{\zeta-1}$ for $s\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a \geq 0$, $b&gt;0$ and $\zeta \geq 1$, and $f\colon\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $g\colon\partial\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ are Carath\'{e}odory functions that grow superlinearly and subcritically. We prove the existence of a nodal ground state solution to the problem above, based on variational methods and minimization of the associated energy functional $\mathcal{E}\colon W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega) \to\mathbb{R}$ over the constraint set \[\mathcal{C}=\Big\{u \in W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega)\colon u^{\pm}\neq 0,\, \left\langle \mathcal{E}'(u),u^+ \right\rangle= \left\langle \mathcal{E}'(u),-u^- \right\rangle=0 \Big\},\] whereby $\mathcal{C}$ differs from the well-known nodal Nehari manifold due to the nonlocal character of the problem.</description>

      <title>On three dimensional flows of viscoelastic fluids of Giesekus type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic rate-type fluids are popular models of choice in many applications involving flows of fluid-like materials with complex micro-structure. A well-developed mathematical theory for the most of these classical fluid models is however missing. The main purpose of this study is to provide a complete proof of long-time and large-data existence of weak solutions to unsteady internal three-dimensional flows of Giesekus fluids subject to a no-slip boundary condition. As a new auxiliary tool, we provide the identification of certain biting limits in the parabolic setting, presented here within the framework of evolutionary Stokes problems. We also generalize the long-time and large-data existence result to higher dimensions, to viscoelastic models with multiple relaxation mechanisms and to viscoelastic models with different type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Global regularity for a physically nonlinear version of the relaxed micromorphic model on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global higher regularity properties of weak solutions for a linear elliptic system coupled with a nonlinear Maxwell-type system defined on Lipschitz domains. The regularity result is established using a modified finite difference approach. These adjusted finite differences involve inner variations in conjunction with a Piola-type transformation to preserve the curl-structure within the matrix Maxwell system. The proposed method is further applied to the linear relaxed micromorphic model.
  As a result, for a physically nonlinear version of the relaxed micromorphic model, we demonstrate that for arbitrary $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the displacement vector $u$ belongs to $H^{\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$, and the microdistortion tensor $P$ belongs to $H^{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$ while $\Curl P$ belongs to $H^{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Localized Inverse Design in Conservation Laws and Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the inverse design problem for a scalar conservation law, i.e., the problem of finding initial data evolving into a given profile at a given time. The solution we present below takes into account localizations both in the final interval where the profile is assigned and in the initial interval where the datum is sought, as well as additional a priori constraints on the datum's range provided by the model. These results are motivated and can be applied to data assimilation procedures in traffic modeling and accidents localization.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations: Regularity, existence and uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish embeddings \`a la Lions and transfer of regularity \`a la Bouchut for a large scale of kinetic spaces. We use them to identify a notion of weak solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations with (local or integral) diffusion and rough (measurable) coefficients under minimal requirements. We prove their existence and uniqueness for a large class of source terms, first in full space for the time, position and velocity variables and then for the kinetic Cauchy problem on infinite and finite time intervals.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations with rough coefficients: existence, uniqueness, upper estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solution operators to Kolmo\-gorov-Fokker-Planck equations with rough (measurable) coefficients and local or integral diffusion on finite and infinite time strips. In the local case, that is to say when the diffusion operator is of differential type, we prove $\L^2$ decay using Davies' method and the conservation property. We also prove that the existence of a generalized fundamental solution with the expected pointwise Gaussian upper bound is equivalent to Moser's $\L^2-\L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions to the equation and its adjoint.  When coefficients are real, this gives the existence and uniqueness of such a generalized fundamental solution and a new and natural way to obtain pointwise decay.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel approach to simulate complex physical systems on the basis of both data observations and physical models. In this work, we investigate the use of PINNs for various applications in aerodynamics and we explain how to leverage their specific formulation to perform some tasks effectively. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of PINNs to construct parametric surrogate models, to achieve multiphysic couplings and to infer turbulence characteristics via data assimilation. The robustness and accuracy of the PINNs approach are analysed, then current issues and challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Regularity for nonlocal equations with local Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we establish fine results on the boundary behavior of solutions to nonlocal equations in $C^{k,\gamma}$ domains which satisfy local Neumann conditions on the boundary. Such solutions typically blow up at the boundary like $v \asymp d^{s-1}$ and are sometimes called large solutions. In this setup we prove optimal regularity results for the quotients $v/d^{s-1}$, depending on the regularity of the domain and on the data of the problem. The results of this article will be important in a forthcoming work on nonlocal free boundary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two systems with a time-variable coefficient and general time-gradually-degenerate damping. More explicitly, we construct the Riemann solutions to the time-variable coefficient Zeldovich approximation and time-variable coefficient pressureless gas systems both with general time-gradually- degenerate damping. Applying the method of similar variables and nonlinear viscosity, we obtain classical Riemann solutions and delta shock wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a degenerate/singular wave equation in one dimension, with drift and in presence of a leading operator which is not in divergence form. We impose a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition where the degeneracy occurs and a boundary damping at the other endpoint. We provide some conditions for the uniform exponential decay of solutions for the associated Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrostatic approximation for inviscid stratified fluids, described by the two-dimensional Euler-Boussinesq equations in a periodic channel. Through a perturbative analysis of the hydrostatic homogeneous setting, we exhibit a stratified steady state violating the Miles-Howard criterion and generating a growing mode, both for the linearized hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic equations. By leveraging long-wave nonlinear instability for the original Euler-Boussinesq system, we demonstrate the breakdown of the hydrostatic limit around such unstable profiles. Finally, we establish the generic nonlinear ill-posedness of the limiting hydrostatic system in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Point-Vortices with Positive Intensities collapsing with the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the point-vortex dynamics with positive intensities. We show that in the half-plane and in a disk, collapses of point-vortices with the boundary in finite time are impossible, hence the solution of the dynamics is global in time. We also give some necessary conditions for the existence of collapses with the boundary in general smooth bounded domains, in particular that the trajectory of at least one point-vortex has no limit. Some minor results are obtained with signed intensities.</description>

      <title>Chain rule symmetry for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the chain rule symmetry for the geometric stochastic heat equations in the full subcritical regime for Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. We show that the renormalised counter-terms that give a solution invariant under changes of coordinates are generated by iterations of covariant derivatives. The result was known only for space-time white noises, with a very specific proof that so far could not be extended to the general case. The key idea of the present paper is to change the perspective on several levels and to use ideas coming from operad theory and homological algebra. Concretely, we introduce the operad of Christoffel trees that captures the counter-terms of the renormalised equation; our main new insight is to describe the space of invariant terms homologically, using a suitable perturbation of the differential of the operadic twisting of that operad. As a consequence, we obtain the correct renormalisation for the quasi-linear KPZ equation in the subcritical regime completing the programme started by Hairer and Gerencser. Previously, the main algebraic tool used in the study of singular SPDEs were Hopf algebras of decorated trees; our work shows that operad theory and homological algebra add new powerful tools with immediate applications to open problems that were out of reach by other methods.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a problem from incompressible fluid mechanics of Brenier (JAMS 1989), and its recent entropic relaxation by Arnaudo, Cruizero, L\'eonard &amp; Zambrini (AIHP PS 2020), we study a problem of entropic minimization on the path space when the reference measure is a generic Feller semimartingale. We show that, under some regularity condition, our problem connects naturally with a, possibly non-local, version of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Additionally, we study existence of minimizers when the reference measure in a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

Abstract: Given a bounded $C^2$ domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and an integral $n$-rectifiable varifold $V$ with bounded first variation and bounded generalized mean curvature. Given a $C^1$ function $\theta$ defined on the boundary of the domain with range $(0,\pi)$, we assume $V$ has prescribed contact angle $\theta$ with $\partial \Omega$ and the tangent cone of $V$ at a point $X \in \partial \Omega$ is a half-hyperplane of density one. Then we can show that the support of $V$ is a $C^{1,\gamma}$ hypersurface with boundary near $X$ for some $\gamma \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>On the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian with mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For a certain class of bounded, simply connected planar domains we prove monotonicity properties of the first eigenfunction. As a consequence, we establish a variant of the hot spots conjecture for mixed boundary conditions. Moreover, we obtain an inequality between the lowest eigenvalue of this mixed problem and the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding dual problem where the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are interchanged. The proofs are based on a novel variational principle, which we establish.</description>

      <title>A Direct Method of Moving Planes for Logarithmic Schr\"odinger Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the radial symmetry and monotonicity of nonnegative solutions to nonlinear equations involving the logarithmic Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger operator $(\mathcal{I}-\Delta)^{\log}$ corresponding to the logarithmic symbol $\log(1 + |\xi|^2)$, which is a singular integral operator given by $$(\mathcal{I}-\Delta)^{\log}u(x) =c_{N}P.V.\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{N}}\kappa(|x-y|)dy,$$ where $c_{N}=\pi^{-\frac{N}{2}}$, $\kappa(r)=2^{1-\frac{N}{2}}r^{\frac{N}{2}}\mathcal{K}_{\frac{N}{2}}(r)$ and $\mathcal{K}_{\nu}$ is the modified Bessel function of second kind with index $\nu$. The proof hinges on a direct method of moving planes for the logarithmic Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger operator.</description>

      <title>Propagation of anisotropic Gabor wave front sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a result on propagation of the anisotropic Gabor wave front set for linear operators with a tempered distribution Schwartz kernel. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set is parametrized by a positive parameter relating the space and frequency variables. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set of the Schwartz kernel is assumed to satisfy a graph type criterion. The result is applied to a class of evolution equations that generalizes the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle. The Laplacian is replaced by any partial differential operator with constant coefficients, real symbol and order at least two.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear regularization estimates and global well-posedness for the Landau-Coulomb equation near equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Landau equation with Coulomb potential in the spatially homogeneous case. We show short time propagation of smallness in $L^p$ norms for $p&gt;3/2$ and instantaneous regularization in Sobolev spaces. This yields new short time quantitative a priori estimates that are unconditional near equilibrium. We combine these estimates with existing literature on global well-posedness for regular data to extend the well-posedness theory to small $L^p$ data with $p$ arbitrarily close to $3/2$. The threshold $p = 3/2$ agrees with previous work on conditional regularity for the Landau equation in the far from equilibrium regime.
  In light of the monotonicity of the Fisher information shown in the recent preprint [arXiv:2311.09420], our primary nonlinear regularization estimate holds even in the far-from-equilibrium regime. As a consequence, we obtain exponential convergence to equilibrium for suitably localized solutions in every Sobolev norm.</description>

      <title>Excursus on modulation spaces via metaplectic operators and related time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulation spaces were originally introduced by Feichtinger in 1983. Since the 2000s there have been thousands of contributions using them as correct framework; they range from PDEs, pseudodifferential operators, quantum mechanics, signal analysis. This justifies a deep study of such spaces and the related Wiener ones. Recently, metaplectic Wigner distributions, which contain as special examples the $\tau$-Wigner distributions, the ambiguity function and the Short-time Fourier transform, have proved to characterize modulation spaces, under suitable assumptions. We investigate the metaplectic action which is hidden in their construction and guarantees equivalent (quasi-)norms for such spaces. We add a new result on this topic and conclude with an exhaustive vision of these characterizations. Similar results hold for the Wiener amalgam ones.</description>

      <title>On the boundary stabilization of the KdV-KdV system with time-dependent delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundary stabilization problem of the Boussinesq KdV-KdV type system is investigated in this paper. An appropriate boundary feedback law consisting of a linear combination of a damping mechanism and a delay term is designed. Then, first, considering time-varying delay feedback together with a smallness restriction on the length of the spatial domain and the initial data, we show that the problem under consideration is well-posed. The proof combines Kato's approach and the fixed-point argument. Last but not least, we prove that the energy of the linearized KdV-KdV system decays exponentially by employing the Lyapunov method.</description>

      <title>On blow up of $C^1$ solutions of isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the break-down of smooth and continuous solutions to isentropic Euler system in multi dimension. Sideris [Comm. Math. Phys. 1985] proved the blow up of smooth solutions when initial data satisfies an `integral condition'. We show that a $C^1$ solution of isentropic Euler equation breaks down if (i) gradient of initial velocity has a negative real eigenvalue at some point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and (ii) Hessian of initial density satisfies a smallness condition in Sobolev space. Our proof also works for the data which fails to satisfy the above-mentioned `integral condition'. Furthermore, we prove the global existence of smooth solution when (i) eigenvalues of gradient of initial velocity have non-negative real-part and (ii) initial density satisfies a smallness condition. This extends the global existence result of [Grassin, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 1998]. Another goal of this article is to study the breakdown of continuous weak solutions of isentropic Euler equations. We are able to show that the `integral condition' of Sideris can cause the breakdown of continuous solutions in finite time. This improves the blow up result of Sideris from $C^1$ to continuous space.</description>

      <title>Nash-Moser iteration approach to the logarithmic gradient estimates and Liouville Properties of quasilinear elliptic equations on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new routine to employ the Nash-Moser iteration technique to analyze the local and global properties of positive solutions to the equation $$\Delta_pv + a|\nabla v|^qv^r =0$$ on a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below, where $p&gt;1$, $q$, $r$ and $a$ are some real constants. Assuming certain conditions on $a,\, p,\, q$ and $r$, we can derive universal and succinct Cheng-Yau type logarithmic gradient estimates for such solutions. In particular, we give the obvious expressions of constants in the logarithmic gradient estimate for entire solutions to the above equation (see \thmref{t10}). The gradient estimates enable us to obtain some Liouville-type theorems, Harnack inequalities and some local estimates near singularities for positive solutions. Some of our results are new even in the case the domain is an Euclidean space and $p=2$.</description>

      <title>On the universal local and global properties of positive solutions to $\Delta_pv+b|\nabla v|^q+cv^r=0$ on complete Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the positive solutions to a nonlinear elliptic equation $$\Delta_pv+b|\nabla v|^q+cv^r =0$$ defined on a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below, where $p&gt;1$, $q,\, r, \, b$ and $c$ are some real constants. If $p&gt;1$ is given and $bc\geq 0$, we provide a new routine to give some regions of $(q, r)$ such that the Cheng-Yau's logarithmic gradient estimates hold true exactly on such given regions. In particular, we derive the upper bounds of the constants $c(n, p, q, r)$ in the Cheng-Yau's gradient estimates for the entire solutions to the above equation. As applications, we reveal some universal local and global properties of positive solutions to the equation. On the other hand, we extend some results due to \cite{MR1879326} to the case the domain of the equation is a complete manifold and obtain wider ranges of $(q,r)$ for Liouville properties.</description>

      <title>Vector Valued G\aa rding Inequality for pseudo-differential operators on compact homogeneous manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sufficient conditions in order to obtain a sharp G\aa rding inequality for pseudo-differential operators acting on vector-valued functions on compact Lie groups. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp G\aa rding inequality for compact homogeneous vector bundles and compact homogeneous manifolds. The sharp G\aa rding inequality is the strongest lower bound estimate known to hold for systems on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and the aim of this paper is to extend this property to systems on compact Lie groups and compact homogeneous manifolds. Our results extend previous works by Lax and Nirenberg [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., Vol. 8, 129-209, (1966)], and by Ruzhansky and Turunen [J. Funct. Anal., Vol. 267, 144-172, (2011)]. As an application, we establish existence and uniqueness of solution to a class of systems of initial value problems of pseudo-differential equations on compact Lie groups and compact homogeneous manifolds.</description>

      <title>A McKean--Vlasov equation with positive feedback and blow-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.07703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a McKean--Vlasov equation arising from a mean-field model of a particle system with positive feedback. As particles hit a barrier they cause the other particles to jump in the direction of the barrier and this feedback mechanism leads to the possibility that the system can exhibit contagious blow-ups. Using a fixed-point argument we construct a differentiable solution up to a first explosion time. Our main contribution is a proof of uniqueness in the class of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions, which confirms the validity of related propagation-of-chaos results in the literature. We extend the allowed initial conditions to include densities with any power law decay at the boundary, and connect the exponent of decay with the growth exponent of the solution in small time in a precise way. This takes us asymptotically close to the control on initial conditions required for a global solution theory. A novel minimality result and trapping technique are introduced to prove uniqueness.</description>

      <title>An Implicit GNN Solver for Poisson-like problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents $\Psi$-GNN, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for solving the ubiquitous Poisson PDE problems with mixed boundary conditions. By leveraging the Implicit Layer Theory, $\Psi$-GNN models an "infinitely" deep network, thus avoiding the empirical tuning of the number of required Message Passing layers to attain the solution. Its original architecture explicitly takes into account the boundary conditions, a critical prerequisite for physical applications, and is able to adapt to any initially provided solution. $\Psi$-GNN is trained using a "physics-informed" loss, and the training process is stable by design, and insensitive to its initialization. Furthermore, the consistency of the approach is theoretically proven, and its flexibility and generalization efficiency are experimentally demonstrated: the same learned model can accurately handle unstructured meshes of various sizes, as well as different boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, $\Psi$-GNN is the first physics-informed GNN-based method that can handle various unstructured domains, boundary conditions and initial solutions while also providing convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions for Constrained Optimal Control with Reach-Avoid Specifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces harmonic control Lyapunov barrier functions (harmonic CLBF) that aid in constrained control problems such as reach-avoid problems. Harmonic CLBFs exploit the maximum principle that harmonic functions satisfy to encode the properties of control Lyapunov barrier functions (CLBFs). As a result, they can be initiated at the start of an experiment rather than trained based on sample trajectories. The control inputs are selected to maximize the inner product of the system dynamics with the steepest descent direction of the harmonic CLBF. Numerical results are presented with four different systems under different reach-avoid environments. Harmonic CLBFs show a significantly low risk of entering unsafe regions and a high probability of entering the goal region.</description>

Abstract: This short letter considers the case of acoustic scattering by several obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^{d+r}$ for $r,d \geq 1$ of the form $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}^r$, where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a main result a von-Neumann-trace formula for the relative trace is obtained in this setting. As a special case we obtain a dimensional reduction formula for the Casimir energy for the massive and massless scalar fields in this configuration $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}^r$ per unit volume in $\mathbb{R}^r$.</description>
