      <title>Quantum Sensing MRI for Noninvasive Detection of Neuronal Electrical Activity in Human Brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal electrical activity underlies human cognition, yet its direct, noninvasive measurement in the living human brain remains a fundamental challenge. Existing neuroimaging techniques, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, are limited by trade-offs in sensitivity and spatial or temporal resolution. Here we propose quantum sensing MRI (qsMRI), a noninvasive approach that enables direct detection of neuronal firing-induced magnetic fields using a clinical MRI system. qsMRI exploits endogenous proton (1H) nuclear spins in water molecules as intrinsic quantum sensors and decodes time-resolved phase information from free induction decay (FID) signals to infer neuronal magnetic fields. We validate qsMRI through simulations, phantom experiments, and human studies at rest and during motor tasks, and provide open experimental procedures to facilitate independent validation. We further present a case study demonstrating potential applications to neurological disorders. qsMRI represents a first-in-human application of quantum sensing on a clinical MRI platform, establishes a non-BOLD functional imaging modality, and enables interrogation of neuronal firing dynamics in both cortical and deep brain regions.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model of Trans-axial Sensitivity in Cylindrical PET Systems Based on Solid Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), a clear theoretical model describing how system sensitivity varies as a source is moved trans-axially within the field of view (FOV) is lacking. The current understanding and practical intuition often suggest that sensitivity is maximum at the center of the FOV, an assumption reflected in standardized protocols. In this work, we derive an analytic model for the trans-axial-plane sensitivity distribution in a cylindrical PET scanner based on solid angle. The model, formulated as a function of trans-axial offset from the center, is validated through both Monte Carlo simulations and physical experiments on a representative system. We find that the derived theoretical distribution is essentially consistent with simulation and experimental results, revealing a non-intuitive feature: sensitivity increases with trans-axial offset, peaks at the edge of the FOV, and drops off sharply beyond it. This study provides the first closed-form model of trans-axial geometric sensitivity in cylindrical PET scanners, offering a vital benchmark for isolating detector technology improvements and revealing a non-intuitive, offset-dependent sensitivity profile that enables new protocol optimization strategies.</description>
