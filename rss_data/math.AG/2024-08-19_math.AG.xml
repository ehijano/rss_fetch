      <title>Stratification of Projection Maps From Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a combinatorial version of Thom's Isotopy Lemma for projection maps applied to any complex or real toric variety. Our results are constructive and give rise to a method for associating the Whitney strata of the projection to the faces of the polytope of the corresponding toric variety. For all examples we produced, our resulting algorithm outperforms known general purpose methods in Helmer and Nanda (FoCM, 2022), and Dinh and Jelonek (DCG, 2021) for computing map-stratifications.</description>

      <title>Topological mirror symmetry for Clarke mirror pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a duality between the graded pieces of the irregular Hodge filtration on the twisted cohomology for a large class of Clarke dual pairs of Landau--Ginzburg models. This results is reminiscent of work of Batyrev and Borisov, and in fact recovers results of Batyrev-Borisov and results of Krawitz, and proves a generalization of a conjecture of Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev for orbifold toric complete intersections with nef anticanonical divisors. Finally we show that one can extract versions of Hodge number duality for orbifold log Calabi-Yau complete intersections, and certain singular mirror pairs, including geometric transitions, and for some toric degenerations appearing in the Fanosearch programme.</description>

      <title>Higher Chow cycles on K3 surfaces attached to plane quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit construction of higher Chow cycles of type $(2,1)$ on $K3$ surfaces obtained as quadruple coverings of the projective plane ramified along smooth quartics. The construction uses a pair of bitangents of the quartics. We prove that the higher Chow cycles generate a rank 2 subgroup in the indecomposable part of the higher Chow group for very general members, by using a specialization argument and an explicit computation of the regulator map.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of real algebraic varieties characterised by a simple rationality condition, which exhibit strong properties regarding approximation of continuous and smooth mappings by regular ones. They form a natural counterpart to the classes of malleable and quasi-malleable varieties. The approximation property studied here is stronger than the ones considered before, and allows one to deduce non-trivial facts about extensions of regular mappings between varieties from closed subvarieties.</description>

      <title>Chow rings of quasi-split geometrically almost simple algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Chow ring of a quasi-split geometrically almost simple algebraic group assuming the coefficients to be a field. This extends the classical computation for split groups done by Kac to the non-split quasi-split case. For the proof we introduce and study equivariant conormed Chow rings, which are well adapted to the study of quasi-split groups and their homogeneous varieties.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the Humbert surface of square discriminant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every positive integer $N$ we determine the Enriques--Kodaira type of the Humbert surface of discriminant $N^2$ which parametrises principally polarised abelian surfaces that are $(N,N)$-isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. A key step in the proof is to analyse the fixed point locus of a Fricke-like involution on the Hilbert modular surface of discriminant $N^2$ which was studied by Hermann and by Kani and Schanz. To this end, we construct certain "diagonal" Hirzebruch--Zagier divisors which are fixed by this involution. In our analysis we obtain a genus formula for these divisors, which includes the case of modular curves associated to (any) extended Cartan subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ and which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hypercomplete \'etale framed motives and comparison of stable homotopy groups of motivic spectra and \'etale realizations over a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any base field and integer $l$ invertible in $k$, we prove that $\Omega^\infty_{\mathbb{G}_m}$ and $\Omega^\infty_{\mathbb{P}^1}$ commute with hyper \'etale sheafification $L_{\acute{e}t}$ and Betti realization through infinite loop space theory in motivic homotopy theory.
  The central subject of this article is an $l$-complete hypercomplete \'etale analog of the framed motives theory developed by Garkusha and Panin. Using Bachman's hypercomplete \'etale \RigidityTheorem and the $\infty$-categorical approach of framed motivic spaces by Elmanto, Hoyois, Khan, Sosnilo, Yakerson, we prove the recognition principle and the framed motives formula for the composite functor \[\Delta^\mathrm{op}\mathrm{Sm}_k\to \mathrm{Spt}^{\mathbb{G}_m^{-1}}_{\mathbb{A}^1,\acute{e}t}(\mathrm{Sm}_k)\xrightarrow{\Omega^\infty_{\mathbb{G}_m}} \mathrm{Spt}_{\acute{e}t,\hat{n}}(\mathrm{Sm}_k).\]
  The first applications include the hypercomplete \'etale stable motivic connectivity theorem and an \'etale local isomorphism \[\pi^{\mathbb{A}^1,\mathrm{Nis}}_{i,j}(E)\simeq\pi^{\mathbb{A}^1,\acute{e}t}_{i,j}(E)\] for any $l$-complete effective motivic spectra $E$, and $j\geq 0$. Furthermore, we obtain a new proof for Levine's comparison isomorphism over $\mathbb C$, $\pi_{i,0}^{\mathbb{A}^1,\mathrm{Nis}}(E)(\mathbb{C})\cong \pi_i(Be(E))$, and Zargar's generalization for algebraically closed fields, that applies to an arbitrary base field.</description>

      <title>Distributions with locally free tangent sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper Stability of Holomorphic Foliations with Split Tangent Sheaf one finds a study of the locus $\mathrm{Dec}$ where the tangent sheaf of a {\it family} of foliations in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ is {\it decomposable}, i.e. a sum of line bundles. A prime conclusion is an ``openness'' result: once the singular locus has sufficiently large codimension, $\mathrm{Dec}$ turns out to be open. In the present paper, we study the locus $\mathrm{LF}$ of points of a family of distributions where the tangent sheaf is {\it locally free}. Through general Commutative Algebra, we show that $\mathrm{LF}$ is open provided that singularities have codimension at least three. When dealing with foliations rather than distributions, the condition on the lower bound of the singular set can be weakened by the introduction of ``Kupka'' points. We apply the available ``openness'' results to families in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ and in $\mathcal B$, the variety of Borel subgroups of a simple group. By establishing a theorem putting in bijection irreducible components of the space of two-dimensional subalgebras of a given semi-simple Lie algebra and its nilpotent orbits, we conclude that the space of foliations of {\it rank two} on $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^n$ and $\mathcal B$, may have quite many irreducible components as $n$ and $\dim \mathcal B$ grow. We also set in place several algebro-geometric foundations for the theory of families of distributions in two appendices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for Hermitian $K$ Theory (or $GW$ theory), analogous to Quillen's D\'{e}vissage theorem for $K$-theory. For abelian categories ${\mathscr A}:=({\mathscr A}, ^{\vee}, \varpi)$ with duality, and appropriate abelian subcategories ${\mathscr B}\subseteq {\mathscr A}$, we prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for ${\bf GW}$ spaces, $G{\mathcal W}$-spectra and ${\mathbb G}W$ bispectra. As a consequence, for regular local rings $(R, \m, \kappa)$ with $1/2\in R$, we compute the ${\BG}W$ groups ${\mathbb G}W^{[n]}_k(\spec{R})~\forall k, n\in {\mathbb Z}$, where $n$ represent the translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we report on the conjectural identification of paramodular forms from Calabi-Yau motives of Hodge type (1, 1, 1, 1) of moderately low conductor. We calculate Euler factors from Calabi-Yau operators from the AESZ database by the method described in P. Candelas, X. dela Ossa and D. van Straten, seek a fit with the tables provided by E. Assaf, W. Ladd, G. Rama, G. Tornaria, and J. Voight and for consistency check the approximate functional equation for the Euler product for primes &lt; 1000 numerically, using the PARI implementation of T. Dokchitser's method.</description>

Abstract: For any positive integer $k$, let $X_k$ be a projective irreducible nodal curve with $k$ nodes. We show that the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of the compactified Jacobian $\overline{J_{k}}$ of an irreducible nodal curve $X_k$ with $k$ nodes are the same as the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of $J_0\times R^k$, where $J_0$ is the Jacobian of the normalisation of the irreducible nodal curve and $R$ denotes the rational nodal curve with one node. We prove it by constructing a topologically locally trivial family of projective varieties containing $\overline{J_{k}}$ and $J_0\times R^k$ as fibres.</description>

      <title>Generic consistency and nondegeneracy of vertically parametrized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.</description>

Abstract: We first recall Grothendieck's notion of n-truncated Barsotti-Tate group. Such groups form an algebraic stack over the integers. The problem is to give an illuminating description of its reductions modulo powers of p. A related problem is to construct analogs of these reductions related to general Shimura varieties with good reduction at p. We discuss some conjectures on this subject based on the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories of symmetric quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced and studied certain categories called quasi-BPS categories associated to symmetric quivers with potential, preprojective algebras, and local surfaces. They have properties reminiscent of BPS invariants/ cohomologies in enumerative geometry, for example they play important roles in categorical wall-crossing formulas.
  In this paper, we make the connections between quasi-BPS categories and BPS cohomologies more precise via the cycle map for topological K-theory. We show the existence of filtrations on topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories whose associated graded are isomorphic to the monodromy invariant BPS cohomologies. Along the way, we also compute the topological K-theory of categories of matrix factorizations in terms of the monodromy invariant vanishing cycles (a version of this comparison was already known by work of Blanc-Robalo-To\"en-Vezzosi), prove a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for matrix factorizations, and prove the compatibility between the Koszul equivalence in K-theory and dimensional reduction in cohomology.
  In a separate paper, we use the results from this paper to show that the quasi-BPS categories of K3 surfaces recover the BPS invariants of the corresponding local surface, which are Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a classical construction in real algebraic geometry. Although there are many algorithms to compute a cylindrical algebraic decomposition, their practical performance is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit this problem from a geometric perspective, where the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition is related to the study of morphisms between real varieties. A new algorithm is proposed in the paper, and its efficiency is demonstrated by experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of singular del Pezzo surfaces with Zariski dense exceptional sets in Manin's conjecture, varying in degrees $1, 2$ and $3$. These examples arise from quasi-\'etale covers with higher $b$-invariants. We classify all quasi-\'etale covers of Du Val del Pezzo surfaces up to singularity types, extending earlier works of Miyanishi-Zhang. Then, we identify all potential examples by studying group actions on the pseudo-effective cones, and show that no such example exists in degree $\geq4$. Finally, we prove that Manin's conjecture with proper closed exceptional sets fails for specific examples, for which we also determine the conjectural exceptional set proposed by Lehmann-Sengupta-Tanimoto.</description>

      <title>The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel sets of quasi-projective groups</title>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's Lefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not extend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Tropical formulae for summation over a part of SL(2, Z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.02089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f(a,b,c,d)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+\sqrt{c^2+d^2}-\sqrt{(a+c)^2+(b+d)^2}$, let $(a,b,c,d)$ stand for $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ such that $ad-bc=1$. Define \begin{equation} \label{eq_main} F(s) = \sum_{(a,b,c,d)} f(a,b,c,d)^s. \end{equation} In other words, we consider the sum of the powers of the triangle inequality defects for the lattice parallelograms (in the first quadrant) of area one.
  We prove that $F(s)$ converges when $s&gt;1$ and diverges at $s=1/2$. (This papers differs from its published version: Fedor Petrov showed us how to easily prove that $F(s)$ converges for $s&gt;2/3$ and diverges for $s\leq 2/3$, see below.) We also prove $$\sum\limits_{\substack{(a,b,c,d), 1\leq a\leq b, 1\leq c\leq d}} \frac{1}{(a+b)^2(c+d)^2(a+b+c+d)^2} = 1/24,$$ and show a general method to obtain such formulae. The method comes from the consideration of the tropical analogue of the caustic curves, whose moduli give a complete set of continuous invariants on the space of convex domains.</description>

      <title>Feynman symmetries of the Martin and $c_2$ invariants of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every regular graph, we define a sequence of integers, using the recursion of the Martin polynomial. This sequence counts spanning tree partitions and constitutes the diagonal coefficients of powers of the Kirchhoff polynomial. We prove that this sequence respects all known symmetries of Feynman period integrals in quantum field theory. We show that other quantities with this property, the $c_2$ invariant and the extended graph permanent, are essentially determined by our new sequence. This proves the completion conjecture for the $c_2$ invariant at all primes, and also that it is fixed under twists. We conjecture that our invariant is perfect: Two Feynman periods are equal, if and only if, their Martin sequences are equal.</description>

      <title>The quantum connection, Fourier-Laplace transform, and families of A-infinity-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Take a closed monotone symplectic manifold containing a smooth anticanonical divisor. The quantum connection on its cohomology has singularities at zero and infinity (in the quantum parameter). At zero it has a regular singular point, by definition. We show that the singularity at infinity is of unramified exponential type. The argument involves: realizing cohomology as a deformation of the symplectic cohomology of the divisor complement; the corresponding deformation of the wrapped Fukaya category; a new categorical interpretation of the Fourier-Laplace transform of D-modules; and the regularity theorem of Petrov-Vaintrob-Vologodsky in noncommutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Free resolution of the logarithmic derivation modules of close to free arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the algebraic structure of a new class of hyperplane arrangement $A$ obtained by deleting two hyperplanes from a free arrangement. We provide information on the minimal free resolutions of the logarithmic derivation module of $A$, which can be used to compute a lower bound for the graded Betti numbers of the resolution.
  Specifically, for the three-dimensional case, we determine the minimal free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module of $A$. We present illustrative examples of our main theorems to provide insights into the relationship between algebraic and combinatorial properties for close-to-free arrangements.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of the commutative graph complex and the top weight cohomology of $\mathcal M_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <title>$K$-Positivity Preservers and their Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $K$-positivity preservers with given closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., linear maps $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ such that $T\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\mathrm{Pos}(K)$ holds, and their generators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, i.e., $e^{tA}\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\mathrm{Pos}(K)$ holds for all $t\geq 0$. We characterize these maps $T$ for any closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ in Theorem 4.5. We characterize the maps $A$ in Theorem 5.12 for $K=\mathrm{R}^n$ and give partial results for general $K$. In Proposition 6.1 and 6.3 we give maps $A$ such that $e^{tA}$ is a positivity preserver for all $t\geq \tau$ for some $\tau&gt;0$ but not for $t\in (0,\tau)$, i.e., we have an eventually positive semi-group.</description>
