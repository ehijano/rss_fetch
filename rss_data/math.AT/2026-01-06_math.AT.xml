      <title>The Shadow of Vietoris--Rips Complexes in Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vietoris-Rips complex, denoted $R_\beta(X)$, of a metric space $(X,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex where each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $X$ within diameter $\beta$. For any abstract simplicial complex $K$ with the vertex set $K^{(0)}$ a Euclidean subset, its shadow, denoted $S(K)$, is the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. This article centers on the homotopy properties of the shadow of Vietoris-Rips complexes $K=R_\beta(X)$ with vertices from $\mathbb{R}^N$, along with the canonical projection map $ p\colon R_\beta (X) \to S(R_\beta(X))$. The study of the geometric/topological behavior of $p$ is a natural yet non-trivial problem. The map $p$ may have many ``singularities'', which have been partially resolved only in low dimensions $N\leq 3$. The obstacle naturally leads us to study systems of these complexes $\{S(R_{\beta}(S)) \mid \beta &gt; 0, S\subset X\}$. We address the challenge posed by singularities in the shadow projection map by studying systems of the shadow complex using inverse system techniques from shape theory, showing that the limit map exhibits favorable homotopy-theoretic properties. More specifically, leveraging ideas and frameworks from Shape Theory, we show that in the limit ``$\beta \to 0$ and $S \to X$'', the limit map ``$\lim p$'' behaves well with respect to homotopy/homology groups when $X$ is an ANR (Absolute Neighborhood Retract) and admits a metric that satisfies some regularity conditions. This results in limit theorems concerning the homotopy properties of systems of these complexes as the proximity scale parameter approaches zero and the sample set approaches the underlying space (e.g., a submanifold or Euclidean graph). The paper concludes by discussing the potential of these results for finite reconstruction problems in one-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

      <title>On the real homotopy type of compact complex surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on a compact complex surface all Massey products of cohomology classes in degree one vanish beyond length three. Dually, the real Malcev completion of the fundamental group is homogeneously presented by quadratic and cubic relations. In the non-K\"ahler case, we give an explicit presentation, which is determined by the first Betti number of the surface.</description>

      <title>Homotopy of Simply Connected Complexes with a Spherical Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a loop space decomposition for certain $CW$-complexes with a single top cell in the presence of a spherical pair, thereby generalizing several known decompositions of Poincar\'{e} duality complexes in which a loop of a product of spheres appears as a direct summand.
  This decomposition is further applied to derive results on local hyperbolicity, on inertness and non-inertness, on the gaps between rational inertness and local or integral inertness, and on the homotopy theory of smooth manifolds with transversally embedded spheres.
  In particular, in every dimension greater than three, there exist infinitely many finite $CW$-complexes, pairwise non-homotopy-equivalent, whose loop spaces retract off the loops of their lower skeletons rationally but not locally, and whose top cell attachments produce infinitely many new torsion homotopy groups with exponentially growing ranks.</description>

      <title>Averages of Arithmetic Functions over Conductors of Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and a sufficiently large (but fixed) prime power $q$ coprime to $G$ we obtain asymptotics for the number of regular Galois extensions $L/ \mathbb{F}_q(t)$, with $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{F}_q(t)) \cong G$, ramified at a single place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, thus making progress on a positive characteristic analog of the Boston--Markin conjecture. We also obtain similar results for other arithmetic functions of the product of places of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ ramified in $L$, and for more general one-variable function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$.
  Some of our proofs make crucial use of a series of recent breakthroughs by Landesman--Levy, as well as a new `vanishing of stable homology in a given direction' result for representations of braid groups arising from braided vector spaces. Other inputs include a study of (rings of coinvariants of) braided vector spaces associated to racks with $2$-cocycles, a connection between convolution of arithmetic functions and direct sums of braided vector spaces, and a Goursat lemma for racks.</description>

      <title>An enumerative min-max theorem for minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an enumerative min-max theorem that relates the number of genus g minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds of positive Ricci curvature to topological properties of the set of embedded surfaces of genus $\leq g$, possibly with finitely many singularities. This completes a central component of our program of using topological methods to enumerating minimal surfaces with prescribed genus.
  As an application, we show that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains at least 4 embedded minimal surfaces of genus 2.</description>

      <title>Commutative classifying space for simplicial groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.04052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simplicial analog of classifying spaces for commutativity which classify principal bundles with commutativity structure on their transition functions. Our construction $\overline W(\tau,K)$, which takes as input a simplicial group $K$ and a cosimplicial group $\tau$ that encodes the additional structure such as commutativity, is a variation of the $\overline W$-construction for simplicial groups. Our main result shows that the geometric realization of our $\overline W(\tau,K)$ is homotopy equivalent to the topological classifying space $B(\tau,|K|)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the base space of a homotopy cofibration is locally hyperbolic under various conditions. In particular, if these manifolds admit a rationally elliptic closure, then almost all punctured manifolds and almost all manifolds with rationally spherical boundary are $\mathbb{Z}/p^r$-hyperbolic for almost all primes $p$ and all integers $r \geq 1$, and satisfy Moore's conjecture at sufficiently large primes.</description>

      <title>On Fico's Lemmata and the Homotopy Type of Certain Gyrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake to determine the homotopy type of gyrations of sphere products and of connected sums, thereby generalising results known in earlier literature as ''Fico's Lemmata'' which underpin gyrations in their original formulation from geometric topology. We provide applications arising from recasting these results into the modern homotopy theoretic setting.</description>

      <title>Multiplicativity of Reidemister-Franz Torsion for Even Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Reidemeister-Franz torsion for non-acyclic cellular chain complexes arising from closed, oriented, highly connected even dimensional manifolds. The monoid of such manifolds under connected sum admits a unique factorisation into indecomposable elements. Using this factorisation, we prove that the Reidemeister-Franz torsion of an even-dimensional manifold decomposes multiplicatively as the product of the torsions of its prime factors without any corrective term.</description>

      <title>Extremal simplicial distributions on cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cycle scenarios are a significant class of contextuality scenarios, with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario being a notable example. While binary outcome measurements in these scenarios are well understood, the generalization to arbitrary outcomes remains less explored, except in specific cases. In this work, we employ homotopical methods in the framework of simplicial distributions to characterize all contextual vertices of the non-signaling polytope corresponding to cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes. Additionally, our techniques utilize the bundle perspective on contextuality and the decomposition of measurement spaces. This enables us to extend beyond scenarios formed by gluing cycle scenarios and describe contextual extremal simplicial distributions in these generalized contexts.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of "virtual morphisms" in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.
  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</description>
