      <title>Determination of certain mod $p$ Galois representations using local constancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime. Let $k = b + c(p-1)$ be an integer in $[2p+2, p^2 - p +3]$, where $b \in [2,p]$ and $c \in [2, p-1]$. We prove local constancy in the weight space of the mod $p$ reduction of certain two-dimensional crystalline representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$, where the slope $\nu(a_p)$ is constrained to be in $(1, c)$ and non-integral. We use the mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence for $\text{GL}_{2} (\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ to compute the mod $p$ reductions explicitly, thereby also giving a lower bound on the radius of constancy around the weights $k$ in the above range and under additional conditions on the slope. As an application of local constancy, we obtain explicit mod $p$ reductions at many new values of $k$ and $a_p$.</description>

      <title>Torsion of Rational Elliptic Curves over the Cyclotomic Extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime such that $p-1$ is not divisible by $3,4,5,7,11$. In this article we classify the groups that can arise as $E(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p))_{\text{tors}}$ up to isomorphism. The method illustrates techniques for eliminating possible structures that can appear as a subgroup of $E(\mathbb{Q}^{ab})_{\text{tors}}.$</description>

      <title>Some ergodic theorems over $k$-full numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem. Later, Loyd showed a disjoint form with the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem. Recently, the author and his coauthors proved some ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers related to these results. In this paper, building on the previous work, we will derive the analogues of Bergelson-Richter's theorem, Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem and Loyd's theorem over $k$-full numbers for any integer $k\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Hecke operators on rational functions II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the action of the Hecke operators $U_n$ on the space $\mathcal R$ of rational functions of one variable, over $\mathbb C$. The main goal is to give a complete classification of the eigenfunctions of $U_n$, answering many questions that were raised in \cite{GilRobins}. We accomplish this by introducing certain number-theoretic directed graphs, called Zolotarev Graphs, which extend the well-known permutations due to Zolotarev.
  We develop the theory of the Zolotarev graphs, and discover certain strong relations between these graphs and the kernel of $U_n$ acting on a subspace of $\mathcal R$. We decompose the eigenfunctions of $U_n$ into certain natural finite-dimensional vector spaces of rational functions, which we call the eigenspaces. In this context, we prove that the dimension of each eigenspace is equal to the number of nodes of its corresponding Zolotarev graph, belonging to a cycle. We prove that the number of leaves of this Zolotarev graph equals the dimension of the kernel of $U_n$. We then give a novel number-theoretic formula for the number of cycles of fixed length, in each Zolotarev graph. We also study the simultaneous eigenfunctions for all of the $U_n$, and give explicit bases for all of them. Finally, we prove that the classical Artin Conjecture on primitive roots is equivalent to the conjecture that infinitely many of these eigenspaces have dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>Classification of the types for which every Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be any finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. It is known by Chase and Sweedler that the Hopf--Galois correspondence is injective for every Hopf--Galois structure on $L/K$, but it need not be bijective in general. Hopf--Galois structures are known to be related to skew braces, and recently, the first-named author and Trappeniers proposed a new version of this connection with the property that the intermediate fields of $L/K$ in the image of the Hopf--Galois correspondence are in bijection with the left ideals of the associated skew brace. As an application, they classified the groups $G$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure on any $G$-Galois extension. In this paper, using a similar approach, we shall classify the groups $N$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$ on any Galois extension.</description>

      <title>Some Representations of the Deformed Euler Numbers ${\rm e}_{s,t,u}$ and Proof for Irrationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, representations of the Euler $(s,t)$-numbers ${\rm e}_{s,t,u}$ are given: as series compression, as Engel series expansion, as a series of partial Theta functions, as a continued fraction and as the limit of a sequence. Furthermore, it is proved that ${\rm e}_{as,a^2t,u^{-1}}$ and ${\rm e}_{as,a^2t,u^{-1}}^{-1}$ are irrational numbers when $a,u\in\mathbb{Q}$ and $\vert au\vert&gt;1$. This is the first step in a program to study the irrationality of $(s,t)$-analog of known numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the group of points of the $3$-sphere modulo a prime, point out connections to other known groups and the Chebyshev polynomials, and show that there is an infinite series which converges if and only if there are finitely many pairs of twin primes. Hence to prove that that the series diverges is to prove the twin prime conjecture.</description>

      <title>Euler constants from primes in arithmetic progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Dirichlet series of number theoretic interest can be written as a product of generating series $\zeta_{\,d,a}(s)=\prod\limits_{p\equiv a\pmod{d}}(1-p^{-s})^{-1}$, with $p$ ranging over all the primes in the primitive residue class modulo $a\pmod{d}$, and a function $H(s)$ well-behaved around $s=1$. In such a case the corresponding Euler constant can be expressed in terms of the Euler constants $\gamma(d,a)$ of the series $\zeta_{\,d,a}(s)$ involved and the (numerically more harmless) term $H'(1)/H(1)$. Here we systematically study $\gamma(d,a)$, their numerical evaluation and discuss some examples.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for $s=\sigma+it$ with $\sigma\ge0$ and $0&lt;t\le x$, we have \[\zeta(s)=\sum_{n\le x}n^{-s}+\frac{x^{1-s}}{(s-1)}+\Theta\frac{29}{14} x^{-\sigma},\qquad \frac{29}{14}=2.07142\dots\] where $\Theta$ is a complex number with $|\Theta|\le1$.

      <title>Wildly ramified unitary local models for special parahorics. The odd dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct local models for wildly ramified unitary similitude groups of odd dimension $n\geq 3$ with special parahoric level structure and signature $(n-1,1)$. We first give a lattice-theoretic description for parahoric subgroups using Bruhat-Tits theory in residue characteristic two, and apply them to define local models following the lead of Rapoport-Zink and Pappas-Rapoport. In our case, there are two conjugacy classes of special parahoric subgroups. We show that the local models are smooth for the one class and normal, Cohen-Macaulay for the other class. We also prove that they represent the v-sheaf local models of Scholze-Weinstein. Under some additional assumptions, we obtain an explicit moduli interpretation of the local models.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform cyclotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclotomy, the study of cyclotomic classes and cyclotomic numbers, is an area of number theory first studied by Gauss. It has natural applications in discrete mathematics and information theory. Despite this long history, there are significant limitations to what is known explicitly about cyclotomic numbers, which limits the use of cyclotomy in applications. The main explicit tool available is that of uniform cyclotomy, introduced by Baumert, Mills and Ward in 1982. In this paper, we present an extension of uniform cyclotomy which gives a direct method for evaluating all cyclotomic numbers over $GF(q^n)$ of order dividing $(q^n-1)/(q-1)$, for any prime power $q$ and $n \geq 2$, which does not use character theory nor direct calculation in the field. This allows the straightforward evaluation of many cyclotomic numbers for which other methods are unknown or impractical. Our methods exploit connections between cyclotomy, Singer difference sets and finite geometry.</description>

      <title>It is not "B\'ezout's identity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ there exist integers $m$ and $n$ for which $am-bn =(a,b)$. An increasing number of mathematicians have been calling this `B\'ezout's identity', some encouraged by finding "identit\'e de B\'ezout" in Bourbaki's \emph{'El\'ements de math\'ematique}. Moreover the observation that if $\gcd(a,b)=1$ then this is an `if and only if' condition, is sometimes called the "Bachet-B\'ezout theorem".
  However this is all in Euclid's work from around 300 B.C., when his writings are interpreted in context. So why does he not get credit? Some authors learned the name "B\'ezout's identity" and have perhaps not consulted Euclid, so copied the misattribution. Others, like some Nicolas Bourbaki collaborators, have perhaps browsed Euclid's results, but in a form written for the modern mathematician, and missed out on what he really did (though certainly others, such as Weil, did not). In this article we will carefully explain what Euclid's arguments are and what his approach was. We will also share Kowalski's guess as to the reasons behind Bourbaki's misnomer.
  To appreciate Euclid, you need to read his work in context: Lengths are the central object of study to the geometer Euclid, though he brilliantly developed the theory of the numbers that measured those lengths. Today's mathematicians read his number theory results as being about abstract numbers not measurements. However the correct interpretation changes how these results are perceived; Euclid's proofs make clear Euclid's intentions.
  These misperceptions reflect recent discussions about difficulties faced by indigenous people when learning mathematics. We discuss how some indigenous groups may learn numbers in certain practical contexts, not as abstract entities, and struggle when curricula assume that we all share abstract numbers as a basic, primary fully-absorbed working tool.</description>

      <title>Reducibility points and characteristic $p$ local fields I- Simple supercuspidal representations of symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field with odd characteristic $p$. Let $N$ be a positive integer and $G=Sp_{2N}(F)$. By work of Lomel\'i on $\gamma$-factors of pairs and converse theorems, a generic supercuspidal representation $\pi$ of $G$ has a transfer to a smooth irreducible representation $\Pi_\pi$ of $GL_{2N+1}(F)$. In turn the Weil-Deligne representation $\Sigma_\pi$ associated to $\Pi_\pi$ by the Langlands correspondence determines a Langlands parameter $\phi_\pi$ for $\pi$. That process produces a Langlands correspondence for generic cuspidal representations of $G$.
  In this paper we take $\pi$ to be simple in the sense of Gross and Reeder, and from the explicit construction of $\pi$ we describe $\Pi_\pi$ explicitly. The method we use is the same as in our previous paper arXiv:2310.20455, where we treated the case where $F$ is a $p$-adic field, and $\pi$ a simple supercuspidal representation of $G=Sp_{2N}(F)$. It relies on a criterion due to Moeglin on the reducibility of representations parabolically induced from $GL_M(F)\times G$ for varying positive integers $M$. We extend this criterion to the case when $F$ has any positive characteristic. The main new feature consists in relating reducibility to $\gamma$-factors for pairs.</description>

      <title>Effective atypical intersections and applications to orbit closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying setting for dealing with monodromically atypical intersections that goes beyond the usual Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular we obtain a new proof of finiteness of the maximal atypical orbit closures in each stratum of translation surfaces $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g (\kappa)$, as given by Eskin, Filip, and Wright. We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture variations of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.14154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a prime number different from the residue characteristic of a non-archimedean local field $F$. We give formulations of $\ell$-adic local Langlands correspondences for connected reductive algebraic groups over $F$, which we conjecture to be independent of a choice of an isomorphism between the $\ell$-adic coefficient field and the complex number field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $\ell\geq 5$ be a prime number. Mazur and Rubin introduced the notion of \emph{diophantine stability} for a variety $X_{/K}$ at a prime $\ell$. We show that there is a positive density set of elliptic curves $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of rank $1$, such that $E_{/K}$ is diophantine stable at $\ell$. This result has implications to Hilbert's tenth problem for number rings.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polynomial $u(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $r\in\mathbb{Z}$, we consider the orbit of $u$ at $r$ denoted and defined by $\mathcal{O}_u(r):=\{u^{(n)}(r)~|~n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. Here we study polynomials for which $0$ is in the orbit, and we call such polynomials \textit{nilpotent at }$r$ of index $m$ where $m$ is the minimum element of the set $\{n\in\mathbb N~|~u^{(n)}(r)=0\}$. We provide here a complete classification of these polynomials when $|r|\le 4$, with $|r|\le 1$ already covered in the author's previous paper, titled \textit{Locally nilpotent polynomials over $\mathbb Z$}. The central goal of this paper is to study the following questions: (i) relation between the integers $r$ and $m$ when the set of nilpotent polynomials at $r$ of index $m$ is non-empty, (ii) classification of the integer polynomials with nilpotency index $|r|$ for large enough $|r|$, and (iii) bounded integer polynomial sequences $\{r_n\}_{n\ge 0}$.</description>

      <title>On the Frobenius fields of abelian varieties over number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a non-CM simple abelian variety over a number field $K$. For a place $v$ of $K$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $v$, let $F(A,v)$ denote the Frobenius field generated by the corresponding Frobenius eigenvalues. Assuming $A$ has connected monodromy groups, we show that the set of places $v$ such that $F(A,v)$ is isomorphic to a fixed number field has upper Dirichlet density zero. Assuming the GRH, we give a power saving upper bound for the number of such places.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by a ring $R$, where $R$ is an order in an imaginary quadratic field or quaternion algebra. We define sesquilinear pairings ($R$-linear in one variable and $R$-conjugate linear in the other), taking values in an $R$-module, generalizing the Weil and Tate-Lichtenbaum pairings.</description>

Abstract: In this article we trace the genesis of a theorem that gives for the first time examples of Galois group $G_S$ of the maximal $p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, unramified outside a finite set of primes not containing $p$, that are of cohomological dimension $2$. The pro-$p$-group $G_S$ is a fab pro-$p$-group which means that all its derived factors are finite.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;1}$. The Steinitz realization problem asks: does every element of the ideal class group of $K$ occur as the Steinitz class of a degree $n$ extension of $K$? In this article, we give an affirmative answer to the Steinitz realization problem for all $n$ and $K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an abelian variety $A$ over a finitely generated field $K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$, we prove that the algebraic rank of $A$ is at most a suitably defined analytic rank. Moreover, we prove that equality, i.e., the BSD rank conjecture, holds for $A/K$ if and only if a suitably defined Tate--Shafarevich group of $A/K$ (1) has finite $\ell$-primary component for some/all $\ell \neq p$, or (2) finite prime-to-$p$ part, or (3) has $p$-primary part of finite exponent, or (4) is of finite exponent. There is an algorithm to verify those conditions for concretely given $A/K$.</description>

      <title>Henselian schemes in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair: a ring A and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of polynomials over A/I to factorizations over A. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry.
  In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</description>

      <title>On blended extensions in filtered tannakian categories and motives with maximal unipotent radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck's theory of blended extensions (extensions panach\'ees) gives a natural framework to study 3-step filtrations in abelian categories. We give a generalization of this theory that is suitable for filtrations with an arbitrary finite number of steps. We use this generalization to study two natural classification problems for objects with a fixed associated graded in a filtered tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. We then give an application to the study of mixed motives with a given associated graded and maximal unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups. We prove a homological classification result for such motives when the given associated graded is "graded-independent", a condition defined in the paper. The special case of this result for motives with 3 weights was proved earlier with K. Murty under some extra hypotheses. The paper also includes some discussions on periods.</description>
