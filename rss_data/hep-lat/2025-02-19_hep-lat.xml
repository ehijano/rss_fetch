      <title>Discrete symmetry and 't Hooft anomalies for 3450 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report our study of the discrete symmetry for lattice 3450 model proposed by Wang and Wen. Lattice 3450 model is expected to describe the anomaly free chiral U(1) gauge theory in 1+1 dimension using 2+1 dimensional domain-wall fermion with gapping interactions for the mirror sector. We find that the lattice model has exact discrete symmetry in addition to U(1) x U(1) symmetry. Assuming the Zumino-Stora procedure works also for discrete symmetry, we compute the full 't Hooft anomaly for the target continuum U(1) chiral gauge theory with the same discrete symmetry. We show that the mixed and self anomalies involving the discrete symmetry are absent, which is consistent with the expectation that the lattice 3450 produces chiral U(1) gauge theory in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Test of a two-level algorithm for the glueball spectrum in $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present preliminary results obtained using a new code for $SU (N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory which performs a 2-level sampling of glueball correlators obtained from a suitably chosen basis of (APE) smeared and unsmeared operators. The code builds loop operators of any shape and length and classifies them according to the irreducible representations of the cubic group. We report on the performances of the algorithm and on the computation of the first low-lying glueball states choosing $N_c = 3$ as a reference to compare our results with the literature.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the semileptonic and nonleptonic $B_c \to J/\psi, \eta_c$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the decay of the $B_c$ meson to S-wave charmonia. Starting with lattice inputs on $B_c\to J/\psi$ form factors, we have obtained the $B_c\to\eta_c$ form factors using heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) relations between the associated form factors after parametrizing and extracting the possible symmetry breaking corrections. Using the $q^2$ shapes of these form factors, we have computed the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(B_c^-\to \eta_c\ell^-\bar{\nu})$ (with $\ell =\tau, \mu (e)$) and the decay rate distributions and have predicted the Standard model estimate for the observable $R(\eta_c)=\Gamma(B_c^-\to \eta_c\tau^-\bar{\nu})/\Gamma(B_c^-\to \eta_c\mu^-\bar{\nu}) =0.310 \pm 0.042$. In addition, we have estimated the radial wave functions $\psi_{B_c}^R(0)$, $\psi_{J/\psi}^R(0)$ and $\psi_{\eta_c}^R(0)$ at small quark-antiquark distances from the available information on the form factors from lattice, the lattice inputs on the decay constants $f_{J/\psi}$, $f_{\eta_c}$, $f_{B_c}$ and experimental data on radiative and rare decays of the $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ mesons. To do so, we choose the theory framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective theory. Using our results, we have predicted the branching fractions of a few non-leptonic decays of $B_c \to J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ and other light mesons. We have also updated the numerical estimates of the cross sections $\sigma(e^+e^- \to J/\psi \eta_c, \eta_c\gamma)$ and predicted the branching fractions of $Z$ boson decays to either $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ final states or both.</description>

      <title>$\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) provides numerically exact solutions for strongly correlated fermionic systems but faces significant computational challenges with increasing system size. While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Effective Strings in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in theories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same order as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of confining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov, for which $M_{gap}^2\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies of order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we analyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at energies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\sqrt{T}$). We argue that the width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$ independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long. We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy of a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the string worldsheet.</description>
