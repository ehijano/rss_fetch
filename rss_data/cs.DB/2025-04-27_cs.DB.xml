      <title>My Precious Crash Data: Barriers and Opportunities in Encouraging Autonomous Driving Companies to Share Safety-Critical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical data, such as crash and near-crash records, are crucial to improving autonomous vehicle (AV) design and development. Sharing such data across AV companies, academic researchers, regulators, and the public can help make all AVs safer. However, AV companies rarely share safety-critical data externally. This paper aims to pinpoint why AV companies are reluctant to share safety-critical data, with an eye on how these barriers can inform new approaches to promote sharing. We interviewed twelve AV company employees who actively work with such data in their day-to-day work. Findings suggest two key, previously unknown barriers to data sharing: (1) Datasets inherently embed salient knowledge that is key to improving AV safety and are resource-intensive. Therefore, data sharing, even within a company, is fraught with politics. (2) Interviewees believed AV safety knowledge is private knowledge that brings competitive edges to their companies, rather than public knowledge for social good. We discuss the implications of these findings for incentivizing and enabling safety-critical AV data sharing, specifically, implications for new approaches to (1) debating and stratifying public and private AV safety knowledge, (2) innovating data tools and data sharing pipelines that enable easier sharing of public AV safety data and knowledge; (3) offsetting costs of curating safety-critical data and incentivizing data sharing.</description>

      <title>PHast -- Perfect Hashing with fast evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perfect hash functions give unique "names" to arbitrary keys requiring only a few bits per key. This is an essential building block in applications like static hash tables, databases, or bioinformatics. This paper introduces the PHast approach that has the currently fastest query time with competitive construction time and space consumption. PHast improves bucket-placement which first hashes each key k to a bucket, and then looks for the bucket seed s such that a secondary hash function maps pairs (s,k) in a collision-free way. PHast can use small-range primary hash functions with linear mapping, fixed-width encoding of seeds, and parallel construction. This is achieved using small overlapping slices of allowed values and bumping to handle unsuccessful seed assignment.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Queries with Many-to-Many Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As database query processing techniques are being used to handle diverse workloads, a key emerging challenge is how to efficiently handle multi-way join queries containing multiple many-to-many joins. While uncommon in traditional enterprise settings that have been the focus of much of the query optimization work to date, such queries are seen frequently in other contexts such as graph workloads. This has led to much work on developing join algorithms for handling cyclic queries, on compressed (factorized) representations for more efficient storage of intermediate results, and on use of semi-joins or predicate transfer to avoid generating large redundant intermediate results. In this paper, we address a core query optimization problem in this context. Specifically, we introduce an improved cost model that more accurately captures the cost of a query plan in such scenarios, and we present several optimization algorithms for query optimization that incorporate these new cost functions. We present an extensive experimental evaluation, that compares the factorized representation approach with a full semi-join reduction approach as well as to an approach that uses bitvectors to eliminate tuples early through sideways information passing. We also present new analyses of robustness of these techniques to the choice of the join order, potentially eliminating the need for more complex query optimization and selectivity estimation techniques.</description>

      <title>Attribution Score Alignment in Explainable Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different attribution-scores have been proposed to quantify the relevance of database tuples for a query answer from a database. Among them, we find Causal Responsibility, the Shapley Value, the Banzhaf Power-Index, and the Causal Effect. They have been analyzed in isolation, mainly in terms of computational properties. In this work, we start an investigation into the alignment of these scores on the basis of the queries at hand; that is, on whether they induce compatible rankings of tuples. We are able to identify vast classes of queries for which some pairs of scores are always aligned, and others for which they are not. It turns out that the presence of exogenous tuples makes a crucial difference in this regard.</description>

      <title>Identifying Chemicals Through Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Civilizations have tried to make drinking water safe to consume for thousands of years. The process of determining water contaminants has evolved with the complexity of the contaminants due to pesticides and heavy metals. The routine procedure to determine water safety is to use targeted analysis which searches for specific substances from some known list; however, we do not explicitly know which substances should be on this list. Before experimentally determining which substances are contaminants, how do we answer the sampling problem of identifying all the substances in the water? Here, we present an approach that builds on the work of Jaanus Liigand et al., which used non-targeted analysis that conducts a broader search on the sample to develop a random-forest regression model, to predict the names of all the substances in a sample, as well as their respective concentrations[1]. This work utilizes techniques from dimensionality reduction and linear decompositions to present a more accurate model using data from the European Massbank Metabolome Library to produce a global list of chemicals that researchers can then identify and test for when purifying water.</description>
