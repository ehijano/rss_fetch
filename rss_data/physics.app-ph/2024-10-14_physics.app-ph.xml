      <title>Unraveling Complex Relationships in Thermoreflectance Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Linear Nonreciprocal Dynamics of Coupled Modulated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguides subject to spatiotemporal modulations are known to exhibit nonreciprocal vibration transmission, whereby interchanging the locations of the source and receiver change the end-to-end transmission characteristics. The scenario of typical interest is unidirectional transmission in long, weakly modulated systems: when transmission is possible in one direction only. Here, with a view toward expanding their potential application as devices, we explore the vibration characteristics of spatiotemporally modulated systems that are short and strongly modulated. Focusing on two coupled systems, we develop a methodology to investigate the nonreciprocal vibration characteristics of both weakly and strongly modulated systems. In particular, we highlight the contribution of phase to nonreciprocity, a feature that is often overlooked. We show that the difference between the transmitted phases is the main contributor to breaking reciprocity in short systems. We clarify the roles of primary and side-band resonances, and their overlaps, in breaking reciprocity. We discuss the influence of modulation amplitude and wavenumber on the resonances of the modulated system.</description>

      <title>Realizing Linear Synaptic Plasticity in Electric Double Layer-Gated Transistors for Improved Predictive Accuracy and Efficiency in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers a low-power, parallel alternative to traditional von Neumann architectures by addressing the sequential data processing bottlenecks. Electric double layer-gated transistors (EDLTs) resemble biological synapses with their ionic response and offer low power operations, making them suitable for neuromorphic applications. A critical consideration for artificial neural networks (ANNs) is achieving linear and symmetric plasticity (weight updates) during training, as this directly affects accuracy and efficiency. This study uses finite element modeling to explore EDLTs as artificial synapses in ANNs and investigates the underlying mechanisms behind the nonlinear plasticity observed experimentally in previous studies. By solving modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (mPNP) equations, we examined ion dynamics within an EDL capacitor &amp; their effects on plasticity, revealing that the rates of EDL formation and dissipation are concentration-dependent. Fixed-magnitude pulse inputs result in decreased formation &amp; increased dissipation rates, leading to nonlinear weight updates and limits the number of accessible states and operating range of devices. To address this, we developed a predictive linear ionic weight update solver (LIWUS) in Python to predict voltage pulse inputs that achieve linear plasticity. We then evaluated an ANN with linear and nonlinear weight updates on the MNIST classification task. The LIWUS-provided linear weight updates required 19% fewer epochs in training and validation than the network with nonlinear weight updates to reach optimal performance. It achieved a 97.6% recognition accuracy, 1.5-4.2% higher than with nonlinear updates and a low standard deviation of 0.02%. The network model is amenable to future spiking neural network applications and the performance improvements with linear weight update is expected to increase for complex networks.</description>

      <title>Dual-band Photonic Filters with Wide Tunable Range Using Chirped Sampled Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a photonic filter featuring dual independently tunable passbands. Employing the reconstruction equivalent-chirp technique, we designed linearly chirped sampled Bragg gratings with two equivalent phase shifts positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the cavity, thus introducing two passbands in the +1st channel. Leveraging the significant thermo-optic effect of silicon, dual-band tuning is achieved via micro-heaters integrated on the chip surface. By tuning the injection currents ranging from 0 to 35 mA into the micro-heaters, the filter exhibits a wide range of dual-wavelength filtering performance, with the frequency interval between the two passbands adjustable from 37.2 GHz to 186.1 GHz.</description>

      <title>Formation of Micrometer-Sized Textured Hexagonal Silicon Crystals via Nanoindentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the formation of micrometer-sized, textured hexagonal diamond silicon (hd-Si) crystals via nanoindentation followed by annealing. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques such as polarized Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we demonstrate the successful transformation of silicon into high-quality hd-Si. The experimental results are further supported by first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, the hd-Si phase consists of nanometer-sized grains with slight misorientations, organized into large micrometer-scale textured domains. These findings underscore the potential of nanoindentation as a precise and versatile tool for inducing pressure-driven phase transformations, particularly for the stabilization of hexagonal silicon. The textured nature of hd-Si also presents a unique opportunity to tailor its optical properties, opening new avenues for its application in semiconductor and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer enhancement of N-Ga-Al semiconductors heterogeneous interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer enhancement of N-Ga-Al semiconductor heterostructure interfaces is critical for the heat dissipation in GaN-based electronic devices, while the effect of the AlxGa(1-x)N transition layer component concentration and thickness on the heat transfer mechanism at the GaN-AlN interface is unclear. In this paper, using molecular dynamics simulations based on machine learning potentials, the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between GaN-AlxGa(1-x)N, AlN-AlxGa(1-x)N and GaN-AlxGa(1-x)N-AlN heterostructure interfaces are calculated for different transition layer thicknesses with different concentrations of Al fractions, and the reasons for the change of ITC and its heat transfer mechanism were explained by the phonon density of states and the spectral heat current. GaN-AlN heterostructure ITC at 300 K is calculated to be 557 MW/(m2K), and the ITCs of GaN-Al0.5Ga0.5N and AlN-Al0.5Ga0.5N are improved by 128% and 229% compared to GaN-AlN, whereas the ITCs of GaN-Al0.7Ga0.3N-AlN containing a 0.5 nm transition layer improved by 27.6%. This is because elemental doping enhances phonon scattering near the interface thereby promoting phonon energy redistribution, but the bulk thermal resistance of the AlxGa(1-x)N layer also increases rapidly with increasing doping ratio, and ITC is affected by a combination of these two factors. This work aims to understand the mechanism of transition layer component concentration and thickness on the heat transfer at the GaN-AlN contact interface, which provides a useful guide for better thermal design of the GaN-AlN heterostructure interface.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of 2D Transducers Based on Suspended Graphene-Based Heterostructures in Nanoelectromechanical Pressure Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based 2D heterostructures exhibit excellent mechanical and electrical properties, which are expected to exhibit better performances than graphene for nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors. Here, we built the pressure sensor models based on suspended heterostructures of graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 by using COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software. We found that suspended circular 2D membranes show the best sensitivity to pressures compared to rectangular and square ones. We simulated the deflections, strains, resonant frequencies, and Young's moduli of suspended graphene-based heterostructures under the conditions of different applied pressures and geometrical sizes, built-in tensions, and the number of atomic layers of 2D membranes. The Young's moduli of 2D heterostructures of graphene, graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 were estimated to be 1.001TPa, 921.08 GPa, 551.11 GPa, and 475.68 GPa, respectively. We also discuss the effect of highly asymmetric cavities on device performance. These results would contribute to the understanding of the mechanical properties of graphene-based heterostructures and would be helpful for the design and manufacture of high-performance NEMS pressure sensors.</description>

      <title>Noise Constraints for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the parameter space of a non-Hermitian system where eigenenergies and eigenstates coincide. They hold promise for enhancing sensing applications, but this is limited by the divergence of shot noise near EPs. According to recent studies, EP sensors operating in the nonlinear regime may avoid these limitations. By analyzing an exemplary nonlinear system, we show that the interplay of noise and nonlinearity introduces previously-unidentified obstacles to enhanced sensing. The noise effectively displaces the EP in parameter space and reduces its order, thereby eliminating the sought-for divergence in the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise near the nonlinear EP experiences a stronger divergence than predicted by standard calculations of the Petermann noise factor, due to the properties of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian governing the fluctuations. Our semi-analytical estimates for the noise level agree quantitatively with the results of stochastic numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Integrated adaptive coherent LiDAR for 4D bionic vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a ubiquitous tool to provide precise spatial awareness in various perception environments. A bionic LiDAR that can mimic human-like vision by adaptively gazing at selected regions of interest within a broad field of view is crucial to achieve high-resolution imaging in an energy-saving and cost-effective manner. However, current LiDARs based on stacking fixed-wavelength laser arrays and inertial scanning have not been able to achieve the desired dynamic focusing patterns and agile scalability simultaneously. Moreover, the ability to synchronously acquire multi-dimensional physical parameters, including distance, direction, Doppler, and color, through seamless fusion between multiple sensors, still remains elusive in LiDAR. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a bio-inspired frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR system with dynamic and scalable gazing capability. Our chip-scale LiDAR system is built using hybrid integrated photonic solutions, where a frequency-chirped external cavity laser provides broad spectral tunability, while on-chip electro-optic combs with elastic channel spacing allow customizable imaging granularity. Using the dynamic zoom-in capability and the coherent FMCW scheme, we achieve a state-of-the-art resolution of 0.012 degrees, providing up to 15 times the resolution of conventional 3D LiDAR sensors, with 115 equivalent scanning lines and 4D parallel imaging. We further demonstrate cooperative sensing between our adaptive coherent LiDAR and a camera to enable high-resolution color-enhanced machine vision.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting squirmer and a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting microswimmer and a solid wall have ubiquitous biological and technological applications. A plethora of gravity-induced swimming dynamics near a planar no-slip wall provides a platform for designing artificial microswimmers that can generate directed propulsion through their translation-rotation coupling near a wall. In this work we provide exact solutions for a squirmer (a model swimmer of spherical shape with a prescribed slip velocity) facing either towards or away from a planar wall perpendicular to gravity. These exact solutions are used to validate a numerical code based on the boundary integral method with an adaptive mesh for distances from the wall down to 0.1% of the squirmer radius. This boundary integral code is then used to investigate the rich gravity-induced dynamics near a wall, mapping out the detailed bifurcation structures of the swimming dynamics in terms of orientation and distance to the wall. Simulation results show that a squirmer may transverse along the wall, move to a fixed point at a given height with a fixed orientation in a monotonic way or in an oscillatory fashion, or oscillate in a limit cycle in the presence of wall repulsion.</description>

      <title>Towards virtual painting recolouring using Vision Transformer on X-Ray Fluorescence datacubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we define (and test) a pipeline to perform virtual painting recolouring using raw data of X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis on pictorial artworks. To circumvent the small dataset size, we generate a synthetic dataset, starting from a database of XRF spectra; furthermore, to ensure a better generalisation capacity (and to tackle the issue of in-memory size and inference time), we define a Deep Variational Embedding network to embed the XRF spectra into a lower dimensional, K-Means friendly, metric space.
  We thus train a set of models to assign coloured images to embedded XRF images. We report here the devised pipeline performances in terms of visual quality metrics, and we close on a discussion on the results.</description>

      <title>Operating conditions and thermodynamic bounds of dual radiative heat engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified description of dual radiative heat engines (RHEs), consisting of two facing optoelectronic components (diodes) and capable of generating electrical power from heat. They can operate in three regimes depending on the applied biases, namely in thermoradiative-negative elec-troluminescent (TRNEL), thermoradiative-photovoltaic (TRPV) or thermophotonic regimes (TPX, consisting of a light-emitting diode and a PV cell). They have access to operating conditions that are unachievable by single RHEs such as thermophotovoltaic systems: at the radiative limit, TRNEL devices can reach the Carnot efficiency for any bandgap, while TPX devices achieve large power outputs by means of electroluminescent enhancement. Expressions of the maximum power output and related efficiency achieved by dual engines are derived analytically, and reveal that the power output of TPX engines is not bounded. A comparison to usual efficiency bounds also highlights the impact of thermalisation losses, and the subsequent interest of spectral filtering to extend the operating region. The influence of nonradiative recombinations is also investigated. This work provides common framework and guidelines for the study of RHEs, which represent a promising solution for reliable and scalable energy conversion.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials hold immense potential for high-power RF electronics and deep ultraviolet photonics. Among these, AlGaN emerges as a promising candidate, offering a tunable bandgap from 3.4 eV (GaN) to 6.1 eV (AlN) and remarkable material characteristics. However, achieving efficient p-type doping in high aluminum composition AlGaN remains a formidable challenge. This study presents an alternative approach to address this issue by fabricating a p+ Si/n-AlN/n+ AlGaN heterojunction structure by following the semiconductor grafting technique. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the AlN and the nanomembrane surface exhibited a smooth topography with a roughness of 1.96 nm and 0.545 nm, respectively. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) confirmed a sharp and well-defined Si/AlN interface, with minimal defects and strong chemical bonding, crucial for efficient carrier transport. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements demonstrated a type-I heterojunction with a valence band offset of 2.73 eV-2.84 eV and a conduction band offset of 2.22 eV -2.11 eV. The pn diode devices exhibited a linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, an ideality factor of 1.92, and a rectification ratio of 3.3E4, with a turn-on voltage of indicating effective p-n heterojunction. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements showed stable operation up to 90 C. The heterojunction's high-quality interface and electrical performance showcase its potential for advanced AlGaN-based optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying multifractal anisotropy in two dimensional objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03541</link>

Abstract: An efficient method of exploring the effects of anisotropy in the fractal properties of 2D surfaces and images is proposed. It can be viewed as a direction-sensitive generalization of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) into 2D. It is tested on synthetic structures to ensure its effectiveness, with results indicating consistency. The interdisciplinary potential of this method in describing real surfaces and images is demonstrated, revealing previously unknown directional multifractality in data sets from the Martian surface and the Crab Nebula. The multifractal characteristics of Jackson Pollock's paintings are also analyzed. The results point to their evolution over the time of creation of these works.</description>

      <title>Extending the spectral operation of multimode and polarization-independent power splitters through subwavelength nanotechnology</title>

Abstract: Power splitters play a crucial role in virtually all photonic circuits, enabling precise control of on-chip signal distribution. However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by subwavelength grating metamaterials. The inclusion of the metamaterial structure circumvents the practical limitations of conventional Y-junction tips and realizes smooth modal transitions. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (&lt; 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultra-broad 700 nm bandwidth (1300-2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300-1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430-1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses &lt; 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to \pm 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic systems requiring high-performance distribution of optical signals.</description>
