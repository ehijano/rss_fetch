      <title>Intermittent fluctuations determine the nature of chaos in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt recent ideas for many-body chaos in nonlinear, Hamiltonian fluids [Murugan \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 124501 (2021)] to revisit the question of the Reynolds number Re dependence of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\propto{\rm Re}^\alpha$ in fully developed turbulence. The use of such decorrelators allow us to investigate the interplay of the competing effects of viscous dissipation and nonlinearity. We obtain a precise value of $\alpha = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ and show that departure from the Kolmogorov mean field result $\lambda \propto \sqrt{{\rm Re}}$ is a consequence of the intermittent fluctuations in the velocity-gradient tensor. The robustness of our results are further confirmed in a local, dynamical systems model for turbulence.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets &amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Inertial Focusing of Spherical Particles: The Effects of Rotational Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of cells and particles based on their transport properties in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications in biology and medicine. Neutrally buoyant particles transported in microfluidic channels, migrate laterally towards stable locations due to inertial effects. However, the effect of the particle and flow properties on these focusing positions remain largely unknown. We conduct large scale simulations with dissipative particle dynamics, demonstrating that freely moving particles exhibit significant differences in their focusing patterns from particles that are prevented from rotation. In circular pipes, we observe drastic changes in rotating versus non-rotating focusing positions. We demonstrate that rotation-induced lateral lift force is significant, unlike previously believed, and is linearly dependent on the rotation magnitude. A simple phenomenological explanation extending existing theories is presented, that agrees well with our numerical findings. In square ducts, we report four face-centered stable positions for rotating particles, in accordance with experimental studies on a range of Reynolds numbers 50 &lt; Re &lt; 200. However, non-rotating particles stay scattered on a concentric one-dimensional annulus, revealing qualitatively different behavior with respect to the free ones. Our findings suggest new designs for micro-particle and cell sorting in inertia-based microfluidics devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Our solution reveals a dual formulation in terms of two interacting Euler ensembles--one for hydrodynamic and another for magnetic circulation. This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = \nu/\eta$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}&lt;1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}&gt;1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature by a multi-dimensional Mellin-Barnes integral representation. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation. Full comparison with physical and real experiments is postponed till the future detailed computation of the spectrum in our solution.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Flow Dynamics in Rotating Detonation Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) are a critical technology for advancing combustion engines, particularly in applications requiring high efficiency and performance. Understanding the supersonic detonation structure and how various parameters influence these phenomena is essential for optimizing RDE design. In this study, we perform detailed simulations of detonations in an RDE and analyze how the flow patterns are affected by key parameters associated with the droplet arrangement within the engine. To further explore the system's sensitivity, we apply polynomial chaos expansion to investigate the propagation of uncertainties from input parameters to quantities of interest (QOIs). Additionally, we develop a framework to accurately characterize the joint distributions of QOIs with a limited number of simulations. Our findings indicate that the strategic release of droplets may be crucial for sustaining continuous detonation waves in the engine, and accurate representations of the solution (e..g via high-order chaos expansions) are essential to accurately capture the dependence between QOIs and input uncertainties. These insights provide a quantitative foundation for further optimization of RDE designs.</description>

      <title>Scaling of wall pressure and the peak of streamwise turbulence intensity in compressible wall flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops scaling laws for wall-pressure root-mean-square (r.m.s.) and the peak of streamwise turbulence intensity, accounting for both variable-property and intrinsic compressibility effects -- those associated with changes in fluid volume due to pressure variations. To develop such scaling laws, we express the target quantities as an expansion series in powers of an appropriately defined Mach number. The leading-order term is represented using the scaling relations developed for incompressible flows, but with an effective Reynolds number. Higher-order terms capture intrinsic compressibility effects and are modeled as constant coefficients, calibrated using flow cases specifically designed to isolate these effects. The resulting scaling relations are shown to be accurate for a wide range of turbulent channel flows and boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Exploring forms of the moist shallow water equations using a new compatible finite element discretisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moist shallow water equations offer a promising route for advancing understanding of the coupling of physical parametrisations and dynamics in numerical atmospheric models, an issue known as 'physics-dynamics coupling'. Without moist physics, the traditional shallow water equations are a simplified form of the atmospheric equations of motion and so are computationally cheap, but retain many relevant dynamical features of the atmosphere. Introducing physics into the shallow water model in the form of moisture provides a tool to experiment with numerical techniques for physics-dynamics coupling in a simple dynamical model. In this paper, we compare some of the different moist shallow water models by writing them in a general formulation. The general formulation encompasses three existing forms of the moist shallow water equations and also a fourth, previously unexplored formulation. The equations are coupled to a three-state moist physics scheme that interacts with the resolved flow through source terms and produces two-way physics-dynamics feedback. We present a new compatible finite element discretisation of the equations and apply it to the different formulations of the moist shallow water equations in three test cases. The results show that the models capture generation of cloud and rain and physics-dynamics interactions, and demonstrate some differences between moist shallow water formulations and the implications of these different modelling choices.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 100 trillion grid points via information geometric regularization and the MFC flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).</description>
