      <title>Platinum Ditelluride based Field Effect Transistors for highly sensitive H2S sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials, specifically transition metal dichalcogenides, for highly sensitive gas sensing are emerging as effective detection technology. Platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) is an intriguing material in the realm of field-effect transistors (FETs) due to its unique electronic properties. In this study, the CVDsynthesized PtTe2 was functionalized with Au-Pd thin film for analyte-specific (H2S) sensing for better toxic gas sensitivity and selectivity. It was concluded that PtTe2, in combination with appropriate metal or oxide decorations, had great potential for ultrasensitive and selective, real-time gas sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Characteristic transition of the dominant power loss from diffractive to ohmic in overmoded and periodically loaded waveguides at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of electromagnetic fields in cylindrical waveguiding structures that contain periodic ring loading, whether for applications in charged-particle accelerators or radiation transportation, has been traditionally conducted under simplifying limits, where the structure is either single-moded at the lower-frequency limit or overmoded at high-frequency limit. These limits have often allowed us to find spectral (modal) expansions for the fields under simpler analytical and computational conditions, with ohmic effects typically being the dominant power loss mechanism in the lower limit, while diffraction effects dominate the loss in the higher limit. In this Letter, we report the observation of a transition point in the character of the main loss mechanism, where ohmic loss becomes dominant in a structure typically presumed to be dominated by diffraction loss. The results follow a formal analysis for the scattered vector fields in a highly overmoded THz waveguide. The findings bridge between the traditional theoretical descriptions for the two limits and reveal key tradeoffs that inform experiments for the transportation of THz radiation over long distances.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Characterization of Living Mycelium through Dispersion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores the feasibility of using living mycelium as a sustainable biosensing material for structural health monitoring in buildings and infrastructure. Methods: An electrical impedance network model was developed to characterize the signal transmission properties of mycelium. The model was coupled with the inhomogeneous wave correlation (IWC) method, commonly used in elastic wave propagation, to assess the dispersion behavior of electrical signals through mycelial networks. Experimental validation was conducted using living, dehydrated, and rehydrated mycelium samples. Results: The results demonstrate clear frequency-dependent and spatial attenuation characteristics of electrical signals in mycelium. The analysis highlights the critical role of environmental humidity in enabling effective signal transmission. Furthermore, dispersion behavior was used to assess the homogeneity of the material, revealing differences in signal behavior across hydration states. Conclusion: The combination of impedance modeling and dispersion analysis confirms that living mycelium can serve as a viable medium for transmitting and sensing electrical signals in a structurally integrated form. Its performance is significantly influenced by hydration level, reinforcing the need to control or monitor environmental conditions in practical applications. Significance: This work introduces mycelium as a novel, biodegradable material for embedded biosensing, contributing to the advancement of sustainable technologies in biomedical and structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin waves in out-of-plane magnetized waveguides reconfigured by domain wall displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-based platforms for novel unconventional computing approaches like neuromorphic computing require a well-defined, but adjustable flow of wave information combined with non-volatile data storage elements to implement weights which allow for training and learning. Due to their inherent nonreciprocal properties and their direct physical interaction with magnetic data storage, spin waves are ideal candidates to realize such platforms. In the present study, we show how spin-wave nonreciprocity induced by dipolar interactions of nanowaveguides with antiparallel, out-of-plane magnetization orientations can be used to create a spin-wave circulator allowing for unidirectional information transport and complex signal routing. In addition, the device can be reconfigured by a magnetic domain wall with adjustable position, which allows for a non-volatile tuning of the nonreciprocity and signal propagation. These properties are demonstrated for a spin-wave directional coupler through a combination of micromagnetic simulations and analytical modeling also showing that it functions as a waveguide crossing element, tunable power splitter, isolator, and frequency multiplexer. As magnetic material, out-of-plane magnetized Bismuth-doped Yttrium Iron Garnet has been considered. For this material, the motion of domain walls by magnonic spin transfer torque has been recently experimentally demonstrated which enables to store results from spin-wave computation. In combination with the presented concept of domain wall based reconfiguration and nonlinear spin-wave dynamics, this enables for the creation of a nano-scaled nonlinear wave computing platform with the capability for self-learning.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Sb2S3 Optical Phase Shifter Enabled by Optimizing Sputtering Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By quantitatively evaluating the atomic concentrations of sputtered Sb2S3 films with different sputtering powers and Ar flows, we reveal that a sputtered Sb2S3 film becomes close to the stoichiometric composition as the sputtering power and Ar flow decrease. We characterize the optical properties of Sb2S3 and show that the lower sputtering power leads to a better figure of merit of Sb2S3 as an optical phase shifter in the near infrared (NIR) range. Based on these results, we achieve a loss per phase shift of 0.33 dB/{\pi} at a wavelength of 1.55 {\mu}m, one of the lowest losses among Sb2S3 phase shifters in the NIR range.</description>

      <title>Single Vanadium Dioxide Nanoparticle-Enabled Plasmonic switch with Thermal and Electronic Reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an integrated switch that combines plasmonic and neuromorphic technologies with a single sub-stoichiometric VO2-x nanoparticle. The presented device acts as a versatile plasmonic switch with dual thermal and electrical reconfigurability leveraging the near-room temperature phase transition of the VO2-x nanoparticles combined with the rapid phase recovery to drive the device. The change in both the optical and electrical properties of the VO2-x nanoparticle enables simultaneous optical and electrical readouts making the plasmonic device suitable as a phase change memory cell which is crucial in the convergence of computing and communication technologies. Our demonstration of reversible electrical switching, evidenced by a 6dB modulation depth and concurrent optical and electrical outputs, signifies a major stride in merging electronic and photonic functionalities within phase-change material devices. This novel strategy not only harmonizes optical communication with electronic computing but also advances the development of sophisticated integrated neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel electrically tunable varifocal metalens with compact multilayer polarization-dependent metasurfaces and liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an essential module of optical systems, varifocal lens usually consists of multiple mechanically moving lenses along the optical axis. The recent development of metasurfaces with tunable functionalities holds the promise of miniaturizing varifocal lens. However, existing varifocal metalenses are hard to combine electrical tunability with scalable number and range of focal lengths, thus limiting the practical applications. Our previous work shows that the electrically tunable channels could be increased to 2N by cascading N polarization-dependent metasurfaces with liquid crystals (LCs). Here, we demonstrated a compact eight-channel electrically tunable varifocal metalens with three single-layer polarization-multiplexed bi-focal metalens and three LC cells. The total thickness of the device is ~6 mm, while the focal lengths could be switched among eight values within the range of 3.6 to 9.6 mm. The scheme is scalable in number and range of focal lengths and readily for further miniaturization. We believe that our proposal would open new possibilities of miniaturized imaging systems, AR/VR displays, LiDAR, etc.</description>

      <title>An approach for thermal conductivity measurements in thin films: Combining localized surface topography, thermal analysis, and machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for determining the thermal conductivity (TC) of materials with high reliability. The methodology addresses issues such as surface topographical variations and substrate interference by combining Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) with machine learning (ML) models and normalization techniques. Micro- and nanostructural variations in thin films exacerbate measurement inconsistencies, reducing repeatability and reliability. These interconnected challenges highlight the need for a novel, flexible, and adaptive methodology that can comprehensively address the complexities of thin film characterization while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. In this approach, sample surface was divided into fine spatial grids for localized thermal and topographical measurements. A substrate-thickness factor (C factor) was introduced to account for thickness and substrate effects on thin film TC, and high-performance Random Forest regression was used to predict TC across a broad range of materials. The models were trained on a dataset of 2,352 measurements that covered a wide range of material properties and then validated with an additional 980 measurements. They achieved high predictive accuracy, with a $R^2$ of 0.97886 during training and 0.96630 during testing. This approach addresses instrumental limitations and integrates experimental techniques with computational modeling, providing a scalable framework for a wide range of material science applications.</description>

      <title>Exploration of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as cathode for magnesium batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of energy storage technologies that can exhibit higher energy densities, better safety, and lower supply-chain constraints than the current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for our transition into sustainable energy use. In this context, Mg batteries (MBs) offer a promising pathway to design energy storage systems with superior volumetric energy densities than LIBs but require the development of positive electrodes (cathodes) exhibiting high energy and power densities. Notably, amorphous materials that lack long range order can exhibit `flatter' potential energy surfaces than crystalline frameworks, possibly resulting in faster Mg$^{2+}$ motion. Here, we use a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) based calculations to explore amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a potential cathode for MBs. Using an AIMD-generated dataset, we train and validate moment tensor potentials that can accurately model amorphous (Mg)V$_2$O$_5$ Due to the amorphization of V$_2$O$_5$, we observe a 10-14% drop in the average Mg intercalation voltage $-$ but the voltage remains higher than sulfide Mg cathodes. Importantly, we find a $\sim$seven (five) orders of magnitude higher Mg$^{2+}$ diffusivity in amorphous MgV$_2$O$_5$ than its crystalline version (thiospinel-Mg$_x$Ti$_2$S$_4$), which is directly attributable to the amorphization of the structure. Also, we note the Mg$^{2+}$ motion in the amorphous structure is significantly cross-correlated at low temperatures, with the correlation decreasing with increase in temperature. Thus, our work highlights the potential of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a cathode that can exhibit both high energy and power densities, resulting in the practical deployment of MBs.</description>

Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and tested a lens with chromatic aberration coefficient (Cc) of 1.0 mm, a 4.0 mm pole-gap and 2.0 mm bore that is wide enough to accommodate an anti-contamination system and an objective aperture. This lens extends the temporal-coherence envelope of the electron microscope beyond 2 Angstrom, using a low-cost Schottky FEG. We hope that this lens design can be used to improve all 100 keV electron microscopes designed for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM).</description>

      <title>The Non-Local Dual Phase Lag Model of Heat Conduction in a Silicon Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

      <title>Superconducting microwave oscillators as detectors for ESR spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Microwave superconducting resonators are extensively studied in fields such as quantum computing and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. However, the integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to create ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the application of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application of microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR spectroscopy, illustrating an alternative way for the improvement of the performance of oscillator based ESR sensors. Specifically, ESR spectra are obtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR effect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are composed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) or high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) coupled with NbTi or YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) superconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies of 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K (for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9 mHz/Hz$^{1/2}$ (-139 dBc/Hz), the best spin sensitivity is about $1\times10^{10}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$, and the best concentration sensitivity is about $3\times10^{18}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$m$^3$. The approach proposed in this work should allow for significantly better spin and concentration sensitivities compared to those achievable with normal conductors, up to operating frequencies, magnetic fields, and temperatures where superconductors exhibit substantially lower effective microwave resistance than normal conductors.</description>
