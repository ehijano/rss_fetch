      <title>Two-sample comparison through additive tree models for density ratios</title>

Abstract: The ratio of two densities characterizes their differences. We consider learning the density ratio given i.i.d. observations from each of the two distributions. We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with efficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called the balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio can be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning. Specifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that parallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that parallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present two boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other based on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the density ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's resemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a pseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective generalized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers designed for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred density ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and complex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be substantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close connection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the variational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger distance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach while providing unique capabilities in uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the application of our method in a case study involving assessing the quality of generative models for microbiome compositional data.</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation with the full symphony of compact binary mergers using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast Bayesian inference framework to address the growing computational cost of gravitational-wave parameter estimation. The increased cost is driven by improved broadband detector sensitivity, particularly at low frequencies due to advances in detector commissioning, resulting in longer in-band signals and a higher detection rate. Waveform models now incorporate features like higher-order modes, further increasing the complexity of standard inference methods. Our framework employs meshfree likelihood interpolation with radial basis functions to accelerate Bayesian inference using the IMRPhenomXHM waveform model that incorporates higher modes of the gravitational-wave signal. In the initial start-up stage, interpolation nodes are placed within a constant-match metric ellipsoid in the intrinsic parameter space. During sampling, likelihood is evaluated directly using the precomputed interpolants, bypassing the costly steps of on-the-fly waveform generation and overlap-integral computation. We improve efficiency by sampling in a rotated parameter space aligned with the eigenbasis of the metric ellipsoid, where parameters are uncorrelated by construction. This speeds up sampler convergence. This method yields unbiased parameter recovery when applied to 100 simulated neutron-star-black-hole signals (NSBH) in LIGO-Virgo data, while reducing computational cost by up to an order of magnitude for the longest-duration signal. The meshfree framework equally applies to symmetric compact binary systems dominated by the quadrupole mode, supporting parameter estimation across a broad range of sources. Applied to a simulated NSBH signal in Einstein Telescope data, where the effects of Earth's rotation are neglected for simplicity, our method achieves an O(10^4) speed-up, demonstrating its potential use in the third-generation (3G) era.</description>
