      <title>Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024 Campaign -- Cruise Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of weather, sea-ice, ocean, and wave forecasting systems has been a long-standing research focus to improve Arctic forecasting system and their realism and is also a priority of international initiatives such as the WMO research project PCAPS. The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024 Campaign was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order to advance the predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV Svalbard from 4. April - 21.April 2024. In total 34 buoys were deployed in the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The first part of the report describes the instruments and their calibration (Section 2), and the second part briefly describes the weather, sea ice, and wave conditions during the campaign.</description>

      <title>Super Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data With Wind From Reanalysis Data (Sup3rWind) and Application to Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing share of the electricity grid relying on wind to provide generating capacity and energy, there is an expanding global need for historically accurate high-resolution wind data. Conventional downscaling methods for generating these data have a high computational burden and require extensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method, using generative adversarial networks (GANs), for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). We achieve results comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional downscaling by training a GAN model with ERA5 low-resolution input and high-resolution targets from the Wind Integration National Dataset, while reducing computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. Spatiotemporal cross-validation shows low error and high correlations with observations and excellent agreement with holdout data across distributions of physical metrics. We apply this approach to downscale 30-km hourly ERA5 data to 2-km 5-minute wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over Eastern Europe. Uncertainty is estimated over the period with observational data by additionally downscaling the members of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Ensemble of Data Assimilations. Comparisons against observational data from the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System and multiple wind farms show comparable performance to the CONUS validation. This 24-year data record is the first member of the super resolution for renewable energy resource data with wind from reanalysis data dataset (Sup3rWind).</description>

      <title>Substantial Risk of 21st Century AMOC Tipping even under Moderate Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the climate system and considered to be a tipping element. There is still a large uncertainty on the critical global warming level at which the AMOC will start to collapse. Here we analyse targeted climate model simulations, together with observations, reanalysis products and a suite of state-of-the-art climate model results to reassess this critical global warming level. We find a critical threshold of +3C global mean surface temperature increase compared to pre-industrial with a lower bound of +2.2C (10%-Cl). Such global mean surface temperature anomalies are expected to be reached after 2050. This means that the AMOC is more likely than not (&gt; 50%) to tip within the 21st century under a middle-of-the-road climate change scenario and very likely (&gt; 90%) to tip under a high emissions scenario. The AMOC collapse induced cooling is shown to be offset by the regional warming over Northwestern Europe during the 21st century, but will still induce severe impacts on society.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Global Daily CO2 Emissions via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temporal resolution CO2 emission data are crucial for understanding the drivers of emission changes, however, current emission dataset is only available on a yearly basis. Here, we extended a global daily CO2 emissions dataset backwards in time to 1970 using machine learning algorithm, which was trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the smoothed seasonal variations. For example, the range of daily CO2 emissions equivalent to 31% of the year average daily emissions in China and 46% of that in India in 2022, respectively. We identified the critical emission-climate temperature (Tc) is 16.5 degree celsius for global average (18.7 degree celsius for China, 14.9 degree celsius for U.S., and 18.4 degree celsius for Japan), in which negative correlation observed between daily CO2 emission and ambient temperature below Tc and a positive correlation above it, demonstrating increased emissions associated with higher ambient temperature. The long-term time series spanning over fifty years of global daily CO2 emissions reveals an increasing trend in emissions due to extreme temperature events, driven by the rising frequency of these occurrences. This work suggests that, due to climate change, greater efforts may be needed to reduce CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Efficiently improving key weather variables forecasting by performing the guided iterative prediction in latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting refers to learning evolutionary patterns of some key upper-air and surface variables which is of great significance. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been increasingly applied in the field of weather forecasting due to their powerful feature learning capabilities. However, prediction methods based on the original space iteration struggle to effectively and efficiently utilize large number of weather variables. Therefore, we propose an 'encoding-prediction-decoding' prediction network. This network can efficiently benefit to more related input variables with key variables, that is, it can adaptively extract key variable-related low-dimensional latent feature from much more input atmospheric variables for iterative prediction. And we construct a loss function to guide the iteration of latent feature by utilizing multiple atmospheric variables in corresponding lead times. The obtained latent features through iterative prediction are then decoded to obtain the predicted values of key variables in multiple lead times. In addition, we improve the HTA algorithm in \cite{bi2023accurate} by inputting more time steps to enhance the temporal correlation between the prediction results and input variables. Both qualitative and quantitative prediction results on ERA5 dataset validate the superiority of our method over other methods.

      <title>The flow field due to a sphere moving in a viscous, density stratified fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the flow field induced by a sphere translating in a viscous density-stratified ambient, specifically, in the limit of small Reynolds $(Re = \rho U a/\mu \ll 1)$, and viscous Richardson numbers $(Ri_v = \gamma a^3 g/\mu U\ll 1)$, and large Peclet number $(Pe = Ua/D\gg 1)$. Here, $a$ is the sphere radius, $U$ its translational velocity, $\rho$ an appropriate reference density within the Boussinesq framework, $\mu$ the ambient viscosity, $\gamma$ the absolute value of the background density gradient, and $D$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For the scenario where buoyancy forces first become comparable to viscous forces at large distances, corresponding to the Stokes-stratification regime defined by $Re \ll Ri_v^{1/3} \ll 1$ for $Pe \gg 1$, important flow features such as a vertical reverse jet and a horizontal wake, on scales larger than the primary screening length of $\mathcal{O}(aRi_v^{-1/3})$, have been identified by Varanasi and Subramanian (2022). Here, we show that the reverse jet is only the central portion of a columnar structure with multiple annular cells. In the absence of diffusion this columnar structure extends to downstream infinity with the number of annular cells diverging in this limit. We provide expressions for the boundary of the structure, and the number of cells within, as a function of the downstream distance. For small but finite diffusion, two additional length scales emerge - a secondary screening length of $O(aRi_v^{-1/2}Pe^{1/2})$, where diffusion starts to smear out density variations across cells, leading to exponentially decaying flow field; and a tertiary screening length, of $O(aRi_v^{-1/2}Pe^{1/2}\ln(Ri_v^{-1}Pe^3))$, beyond which the columnar structure ceases to exist and the downstream disturbance field reverts from an exponential to eventual algebraic decay, analogous to that prevalent at large distances upstream.</description>

      <title>Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</description>
