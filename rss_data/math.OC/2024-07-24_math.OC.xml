      <title>Benamou-Brenier Formulation of Optimal Transport for Nonlinear Control Systems on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a note on the extension of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport to nonlinear control affine systems on $\mathbb{R}^d$. They are the non-compact version of the author and collaborators' previous result on compact manifolds, stated here for the sake for completeness. Additionally, by using Bernard's Young measure based weak formulation of optimal transport, the results are established for cases not covered by previous works. Particularly, no assumptions are made on the non-existence of singular minimizing controls or the cost function being Lipschitz. Therefore, the existence of solutions to fluid formulation is established for general Sub-Riemmanian energy costs not covered by literature previously. The results also provide controllability of the continuity equation (using Borel measurable feedback laws) whenever the corresponding Kantorovich problem has a feasible solution, due to the established equivalence between the Kantorovich and Benamou-Brenier formulation.</description>

      <title>Restarted Halpern PDHG for Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a new matrix-free primal-dual algorithm, called restarted Halpern primal-dual hybrid gradient (rHPDHG), for solving linear programming (LP). We show that rHPDHG can achieve optimal accelerated linear convergence on feasible and bounded LP. Furthermore, we present a refined analysis that demonstrates an accelerated two-stage convergence of rHPDHG over the vanilla PDHG with an improved complexity for identification and an accelerated eventual linear convergence that does not depend on the conservative global Hoffman constant. Regarding infeasible LP, we show that rHPDHG can recover infeasibility certificates with an accelerated linear rate, improving the previous convergence rates. Lastly, we build up a GPU-based LP solver using rHPDHG, and the experiments on 383 MIPLIB instances showcase a comparable numerical performance as cuPDLP.jl, which demonstrates the strong numerical performance of rHPDHG for solving LPs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Resolvent Splitting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel semidefinite programming framework for designing custom frugal resolvent splitting algorithms which find a zero in the sum of $n$ monotone operators. This framework features a number of design choices which facilitate creating resolvent splitting algorithms with specific communication structure. We illustrate these design choices using a variety of constraint sets and objective functions, as well as the use of a mixed-integer SDP to minimize time per iteration or required number of communications between the resolvents which define the splitting. Using the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework, we provide parameter selections, such as step size, which for high dimensional problems provide optimal contraction factors in the algorithms. Among the algorithm design choices we introduce, we provide a characterization of algorithm designs which provide minimal convergence time given structural properties of the monotone operators, resolvent computation times, and communication latencies.</description>

      <title>Limit Value in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games with Vanishing Stage Duration and Public Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the behaviour of $\lambda$-discounted zero-sum games as the discount factor $\lambda$ approaches 0 (that is, the players are more and more patient), in the context of games with stage duration. In stochastic games with stage duration h, players act at times 0, h, 2h, and so on. The payoff and leaving probabilities are proportional to h. When h tends to 0, such discrete-time games approximate games played in continuous time. The asymptotic behavior of the values (when both $\lambda$ and h tend to 0) was already studied in the case of stochastic games with perfect observation of the state and in the state-blind case.We consider the same question for the case of stochastic games with imperfect observation of the state. More precisely, we consider a particular case of such games, stochastic games with public signals, in which  players are given at each stage a public signal that depends only on the current state. Our main result states that there exists a stochastic game with public signals, with no limit value (as the discount factor $\lambda$ goes to 0) if stage duration is 1, but with a limit value when stage duration h and discount factor $\lambda$ both tend to 0. Informally speaking, it means that the limit value in discrete time does not exist, but the limit value in continuous time (i.e. when h approaches 0) exists. Such a situation is impossible in the case of stochastic games with perfect observation of the state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integro-differential sweeping processes with prox-regular sets in Hilbert spaces have been the subject of various recent studies. Diverse applications of such differential inclusions to complementarity problems, electrical circuits, frictionless contact, can be found in the literature. Here we provide a general theorem of existence of solution for such processes perturbed by a Lipschitz multimapping with nonconvex values.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Multistage Distributionally Robust Linear Optimization with Nested Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multistage distributionally robust linear optimization, where the uncertainty set is defined as a ball of distribution centered at a scenario tree using the nested distance. The resulting minimax problem is notoriously difficult to solve due to its inherent non-convexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, the robust risk evaluation of a given policy can be expressed in an equivalent recursive form. Furthermore, assuming stagewise independence, we derive equivalent dynamic programming reformulations to find an optimal robust policy that is time-consistent and well-defined on unseen sample paths. Our reformulations reconcile two modeling frameworks: the multistage-static formulation (with nested distance) and the multistage-dynamic formulation (with one-period Wasserstein distance). Moreover, we identify tractable cases when the value functions can be computed efficiently using convex optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>EM++: A parameter learning framework for stochastic switching systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general switching dynamical system model, and a custom majorization-minimization-based algorithm EM++ for identifying its parameters. For certain families of distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, this algorithm reduces to the well-known expectation-maximization method. We prove global convergence of the algorithm under suitable assumptions, thus addressing an important open issue in the switching system identification literature. The effectiveness of both the proposed model and algorithm is validated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On Constrained Feedback Control of Spacecraft Orbital Transfer Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper revisits a Lyapunov-based feedback control to implement spacecraft orbital transfer maneuvers. The spacecraft equations of motion in the form of Gauss Variational Equations (GVEs) are used. By shaping the Lyapunov function using barrier functions, we demonstrate that state and control constraints during orbital maneuvers can be enforced. Simulation results from orbital maneuvering scenarios are reported. The synergistic use of the reference governor in conjunction with the barrier functions is proposed to ensure convergence to the target orbit (liveness) while satisfying the imposed constraints.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Optimal Feedback Laws via Kernel Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach for optimal control of nonlinear control-affine systems represented by a stochastic diffusion. The focus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost functions are unknown, while only control penalty function and constraints are provided. Leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce novel kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) to identify the Markov transition operators associated with controlled diffusion processes. The KME learning approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions. Thus, unlike traditional dynamic programming methods, our approach exploits the ``kernel trick'' to break the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical examples, highlighting its ability to solve a large class of nonlinear optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Regularized Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem in the situation where the vector to be recovered has an a priori structure that can encoded into a regularization term. This regularizer is intended to promote solutions conforming to some notion of simplicity or low complexity. We investigate both noiseless recovery and stability to noise and provide a very general and unified analysis framework that goes far beyond the sparse phase retrieval mostly considered in the literature. In the noiseless case we provide sufficient conditions under which exact recovery, up to global sign change, is possible. For Gaussian measurement maps, we also provide a sample complexity bound for exact recovery. This bound depends on the Gaussian width of the descent cone at the soughtafter vector which is a geometric measure of the complexity of the latter. In the noisy case, we consider both the constrained (Mozorov) and penalized (Tikhonov) formulations. We provide sufficient conditions for stable recovery and prove linear convergence for sufficiently small noise. For Gaussian measurements, we again give a sample complexity bound for linear convergence to hold with high probability. This bound scales linearly in the intrinsic dimension of the sought-after vector but only logarithmically in the ambient dimension.</description>

      <title>A new problem qualification based on approximate KKT conditions for Lipschitzian optimization with application to bilevel programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with general Lipschitzian optimization problems, there are many problem classes where standard constraint qualifications fail at local minimizers. In contrast to a constraint qualification, a problem qualification does not only rely on the constraints but also on the objective function to guarantee that a local minimizer is a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. For example, calmness in the sense of Clarke is a problem qualification. In this article, we introduce the Subset Mangasarian-Fromovitz Condition (subMFC). This new problem qualification is based on a nonsmooth version of the approximate KKT conditions, which hold at every local minimizer without further assumptions. A comparison with existing constraint qualifications and problem qualifications for the given problem class reveals that subMFC is strictly weaker than quasinormality and can hold even if the local error bound condition, the cone-continuity property, Guignard's constraint qualification and calmness in the sense of Clarke are violated. Further, we emphasize the power of the new problem qualification within the context of bilevel optimization. More precisely, under mild assumptions on the problem data, we suggest a version of subMFC that is tailored to the lower-level value function reformulation. It turns out that this new condition can be satisfied even if the widely used partial calmness condition does not hold.</description>

      <title>PAMSO: Parametric Autotuning Multi-time Scale Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization models with decision variables in multiple time scales are widely used across various fields such as integrated planning and scheduling. To address scalability challenges in these models, we present the Parametric Autotuning Multi-Time Scale Optimization (PAMSO) algorithm. PAMSO tunes parameters in a low-fidelity model to assist in solving a higher-fidelity multi-time scale optimization model. These parameters represent the mismatch between the two models. PAMSO defines a black-box function with tunable parameters as inputs and multi-scale cost as output, optimized using Derivative-Free Optimization methods. This scalable algorithm allows optimal parameters from one problem to be transferred to similar problems. Case studies demonstrate its effectiveness on an MINLP model for integrated design and scheduling in a resource task network with around 67,000 variables and an MILP model for integrated planning and scheduling of electrified chemical plants and renewable resources with around 26 million variables.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle and Ensemble Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer adversary's estimate of target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like inverse Kalman filter (I-KF), inverse extended KF (I-EKF), and inverse unscented KF (I-UKF). However, these inverse filters assume additive Gaussian noises and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. Contrarily, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and develops an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we explore MC techniques to approximate Gaussian posteriors and introduce inverse Gaussian PF (I-GPF) and inverse ensemble KF (I-EnKF). Our I-GPF and I-EnKF can efficiently handle non-Gaussian noises with suitable modifications. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF, differentiable I-EnKF, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EnKF (RKHS-EnKF) methods to address scenarios where system information is unknown to defender. Using recursive Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different applications demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filters.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GNNs Performance on Combinatorial Optimization by Recurrent Feature Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are crucial in various scientific and industrial applications. Recently, researchers have proposed using unsupervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, which can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. GNNs have demonstrated high performance with nearly linear scalability and significantly outperformed classic heuristic-based algorithms in terms of computational efficiency on large-scale problems. However, when utilizing standard node features, GNNs tend to get trapped to suboptimal local minima of the energy landscape, resulting in low quality solutions. We introduce a novel algorithm, denoted hereafter as QRF-GNN, leveraging the power of GNNs to efficiently solve CO problems with QUBO formulation. It relies on unsupervised learning by minimizing the loss function derived from QUBO relaxation. The proposed key components of the architecture include the recurrent use of intermediate GNN predictions, parallel convolutional layers and combination of static node features as input. Altogether, it helps to adapt the intermediate solution candidate to minimize QUBO-based loss function, taking into account not only static graph features, but also intermediate predictions treated as dynamic, i.e. iteratively changing recurrent features. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on the canonical benchmark datasets for maximum cut, graph coloring and maximum independent set problems. Results of experiments show that QRF-GNN drastically surpasses existing learning-based approaches and is comparable to the state-of-the-art conventional heuristics, improving their scalability on large instances.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium control theory for Kihlstrom-Mirman preferences in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In intertemporal settings, the multiattribute utility theory of Kihlstrom and Mirman suggests the application of a concave transform of the lifetime utility index. This construction, while allowing time and risk attitudes to be separated, leads to dynamically inconsistent preferences. We address this issue in a game-theoretic sense by formalizing an equilibrium control theory for continuous-time Markov processes. In these terms, we describe the equilibrium strategy and value function as the solution of an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of partial differential equations. We verify that (the solution of) this system is a sufficient condition for an equilibrium and examine some of its novel features. A consumption-investment problem for an agent with CRRA-CES utility showcases our approach.</description>

      <title>Subgradient sampling for nonsmooth nonconvex minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk minimization for nonsmooth nonconvex problems naturally leads to first-order sampling or, by an abuse of terminology, to stochastic subgradient descent. We establish the convergence of this method in the path-differentiable case and describe more precise results under additional geometric assumptions. We recover and improve results from Ermoliev and Norkin [Cybern. Syst. Anal., 34 (1998), pp. 196--215] by using a different approach: conservative calculus and the ODE method. In the definable case, we show that first-order subgradient sampling avoids artificial critical points with probability one and applies moreover to a large range of risk minimization problems in deep learning, based on the backpropagation oracle. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain several results on integration of independent interest, such as an interchange result for conservative derivatives and integrals or the definability of set-valued parameterized integrals.</description>

Abstract: Sharpness is an almost generic assumption in continuous optimization that bounds the distance from minima by objective function suboptimality. It facilitates the acceleration of first-order methods through restarts. However, sharpness involves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and restart schemes typically reduce convergence rates. Moreover, these schemes are challenging to apply in the presence of noise or with approximate model classes (e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and they generally assume that the first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the assumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that incorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error. This constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or relaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a new type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that applies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order method to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence rate as when the constants are known. The convergence rates we achieve for various first-order methods match the optimal rates or improve on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We showcase our restart scheme in several examples and highlight potential future applications and developments of our framework and theory.</description>

      <title>Multiple Lyapunov Functions and Memory: A Symbolic Dynamics Approach to Systems and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for the Lyapunov analysis of an important class of hybrid systems, inspired by the theory of symbolic dynamics and earlier results on the restricted class of switched systems. This new framework allows us to leverage language theory tools in order to provide a universal characterization of Lyapunov stability for this class of systems. We establish, in particular, a formal connection between multiple Lyapunov functions and techniques based on memorization and/or prediction of the discrete part of the state. This allows us to provide an equivalent (single) Lyapunov function, for any given multiple-Lyapunov criterion. By leveraging our language-theoretic formalism, a new class of stability conditions is then obtained when considering both memory and future values of the state in a joint fashion, providing new numerical schemes that outperform existing technique. Our techniques are then illustrated on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-driven MPC with stability guarantees using extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00296v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonlinear (control) systems, extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a popular method to obtain data-driven surrogate models. Its theoretical foundation is the Koopman framework, in which one propagates observable functions of the state to obtain a linear representation in an infinite-dimensional space. In this work, we prove practical asymptotic stability of a (controlled) equilibrium for EDMD-based model predictive control, in which the optimization step is conducted using the data-based surrogate model. To this end, we derive novel bounds on the estimation error that are proportional to the norm of state and control. This enables us to show that, if the underlying system is cost controllable, this stabilizablility property is preserved. We conduct numerical simulations illustrating the proven practical asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>A Rank-Dependent Theory for Decision under Risk and Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper axiomatizes, in a two-stage setup, a new theory for decision under risk and ambiguity. The axiomatized preference relation $\succeq$ on the space $\tilde{V}$ of random variables induces an ambiguity index $c$ on the space $\Delta$ of probabilities, a probability weighting function $\psi$, generating the measure $\nu_{\psi}$ by transforming an objective probability measure, and a utility function $\phi$, such that, for all $\tilde{v},\tilde{u}\in\tilde{V}$, \begin{align*} \tilde{v}\succeq\tilde{u} \Leftrightarrow \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{v}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\} \geq \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{u}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\}. \end{align*} Our theory extends the rank-dependent utility model of Quiggin (1982) for decision under risk to risk and ambiguity, reduces to the variational preferences model when $\psi$ is the identity, and is dual to variational preferences when $\phi$ is affine in the same way as the theory of Yaari (1987) is dual to expected utility. As a special case, we obtain a preference axiomatization of a decision theory that is a rank-dependent generalization of the popular maxmin expected utility theory. We characterize ambiguity aversion in our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new optimization framework to design steady equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system by means of external electric fields is presented. This optimization framework requires the minimization of an ensemble functional with Tikhonov regularization of the control field under the differential constraint of a nonlinear elliptic equation that models equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system. Existence of optimal control fields and their characterization as solutions to first-order optimality conditions are discussed. Numerical approximations and optimization schemes are developed to validate the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KKL (Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger) observers are based on the idea of immersing a given nonlinear system into a target system that is a linear stable filter of the measured output. In the present paper, we extend this theory by allowing this target system to be a nonlinear contracting filter of the output. We prove, under a differential observability condition, the existence of these new KKL observers. We motivate their introduction by showing numerically the possibility of combining convergence speed and robustness to noise, unlike what is known for linear filtering.</description>

      <title>The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem with multiple drops: A simple and effective heuristic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Drops (FSTSP-MD), a multi-modal last-mile delivery model where a single truck and a single drone cooperatively deliver customer packages. In the FSTSP-MD, the drone can be launched from the truck to deliver multiple packages before it returns to the truck for a new delivery operation. The objective is to find the synchronized truck and drone delivery routes that minimize the completion time of the delivery process. We develop a simple and effective heuristic to solve the FSTSP-MD based on an order-first, split-second scheme. This heuristic combines standard local search and diversification techniques with a novel shortest-path problem that finds FSTSP-MD solutions in polynomial time. We show that our heuristic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics developed for the FSTSP-MD and the FSTSP (i.e., the single-drop case) through extensive numerical experiments. Based on both stylized and real-world instances, we also show that the FSTSP-MD substantially reduces completion times compared to traditional truck-only delivery systems. We provide extensive management insights into the impacts of drone capabilities and customer distribution on delivery efficiency. Our discussion compares the benefits of drones with greater payload capacity and those with greater speed. We highlight which service area characteristics increase savings but also require enhanced drone capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a game between $N$ job applicants who incur a cost $c$ (relative to the job value) to reveal their type during interviews and an administrator who seeks to maximize the probability of hiring the best. We define a full learning equilibrium and prove its existence, uniqueness, and optimality. In equilibrium, the administrator accepts the current best applicant $n$ with probability $c$ if $n&lt;n^*$ and with probability 1 if $n\ge n^*$ for a threshold $n^*$ independent of $c$. In contrast to the case without cost, where the success probability converges to $1/\mathrm{e}\approx 0.37$ as $N$ tends to infinity, with cost the success probability decays like $N^{-c}$.</description>

      <title>Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Integer Programming Using A Single Atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer programming (IP), as the name suggests is an integer-variable-based approach commonly used to formulate real-world optimization problems with constraints. Currently, quantum algorithms reformulate the IP into an unconstrained form through the use of binary variables, which is an indirect and resource-consuming way of solving it. We develop an algorithm that maps and solves an IP problem in its original form to any quantum system possessing a large number of accessible internal degrees of freedom that are controlled with sufficient accuracy. This work leverages the principle of superposition to solve the optimization problem. Using a single Rydberg atom as an example, we associate the integer values to electronic states belonging to different manifolds and implement a selective superposition of different states to solve the full IP problem. The optimal solution is found within a few microseconds for prototypical IP problems with up to eight variables and four constraints. This also includes non-linear IP problems, which are usually harder to solve with classical algorithms when compared to their linear counterparts. Our algorithm for solving IP is benchmarked by a well-known classical algorithm (branch and bound) in terms of the number of steps needed for convergence to the solution. This approach carries the potential to improve the solutions obtained for larger-size problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Smooth Tchebycheff Scalarization for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications, where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto solutions that represent optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem. However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique, we propose a lightweight and efficient smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Co-dimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k, n \geq 0$, and $c \in Z^n$, we consider ILP problems \begin{gather*}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x = b,\, x \in Z^n_{\geq 0} \bigr\}\text{ with $A \in Z^{k \times n}$, $rank(A) = k$, $b \in Z^{k}$ and}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n \bigr\} \text{ with $A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}$, $rank(A) = n$, $b \in Z^{n+k}$.} \end{gather*} The first problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the standard form of the codimension $k$}, and the second problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the canonical form with $n+k$ constraints.} We show that, for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot (f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)^2 / 2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)}\bigr)} $$ operations, where $
  f_{k,d} = \min \Bigl\{ k^{k/2},
  \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (d + k)\bigr)^{k/2}
  \Bigr\} $, $d$ is the dimension of a corresponding polyhedron and $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $rank(A) \times rank(A)$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  As our second main result, we show that the feasibility variants of both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta \cdot \log^3(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta) $$ operations. The constant $f_{k,d}$ can be replaced by other constant $g_{k,\Delta} = \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (k \Delta)\bigr)^{k/2}$ that depends only on $k$ and $\Delta$. Additionally, we consider different partial cases with $k=0$ and $k=1$, which have interesting applications.
  As a result of independent interest, we propose an $n^2/2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log n}\bigr)}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences, indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of the order $n$. Additionally, we give a complete, self-contained error analysis of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform for Abelian groups with respect to the Word-RAM computational model.</description>
