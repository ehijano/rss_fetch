      <title>Dual-domain Microwave Photonic Radar for Non-contact High-resolution Monitoring of Vital Signs in Multiple Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dual-domain microwave photonic radar system for multi-parameter vital sign monitoring, utilizing ultra-wideband radiofrequency signals to achieve high-precision chest displacement measurements, while high-frequency optical signals enable accurate Doppler detection of pulse-induced micro-motions. We experimentally validated the system by simultaneously monitoring respiratory and pulse rate of two male volunteers, demonstrating high performance with average accuracies of 98.1% for pulse detection and 99.85% for respiratory detection. Additionally, the system facilitates rapid, indirect blood pressure estimation, achieving a coefficient of determination of 0.905. With the help of low-loss distribution capability of optical fibers, the system can be scaled into a distributed, non-contact multiple vital signs monitoring platform, highlighting its potential for clinical and healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Dinosaur Photonic Crystal Cavity Interfaces for Color Center Coupling to Triangular Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide-coupled photonic crystal cavities with a triangular cross section fabricated by angled etching are suitable to interface embedded color centers with flying photonic qubits in quantum information applications. Moreover, their fabrication requires fewer processing steps compared to nanostructures produced by quasi-isotropic undercutting. As an alternative to established hole-based photonic crystal cavities, we introduce corrugated triangular 'Dinosaur' photonic crystal cavities, and develop a tapered, quasi loss-free cavity-waveguide interface to adiabatically interconvert Bloch and waveguide modes. We optimize the cavity-waveguide interface to minimize photon losses and demonstrate that its adjustment allows precise tuning of the light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Incoherent dielectric tensor tomography for quantitative 3D measurement of biaxial anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biaxial anisotropy, arising from distinct optical responses along three principal directions, underlies the complex structure of many crystalline, polymeric, and biological materials. However, existing techniques such as X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy require specialized facilities or destructive preparation and cannot provide full three-dimensional (3D) information. Here we introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT), a non-interferometric optical imaging method that quantitatively reconstructs the 3D dielectric tensor under incoherent, polarization-diverse illumination. By combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation, iDTT achieves speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence with submicron resolution. Simulations and experiments on uniaxial and biaxial samples validate its quantitative accuracy. Applied to mixed and polycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguishes crystal types by their birefringent properties and reveals 3D grain orientations and boundaries. This approach establishes iDTT as a practical and accessible tool for quantitative, label-free characterization of biaxial anisotropy in diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index-Correlated Pseudocoloring for Adaptive Color Fusion in Holotomographic Cytology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional bright-field (BF) cytology of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) suffers from staining variability and limited subcellular contrast. Here, we present a refractive index-correlated pseudocoloring (RICP) framework that integrates quantitative refractive index (RI) maps obtained by holotomography (HT) with color BF images to enhance diagnostic interpretability. The imaging platform combines a digital micromirror device (DMD)-based HT system with an RGB LED illumination module, enabling simultaneous acquisition of RI tomograms and BF images from PAP-stained thyroid samples. The RICP algorithm adaptively embeds RI-derived structural information into the least-occupied hue channel, preserving color fidelity while enhancing nuclear and cytoplasmic contrast. Applied to benign and malignant thyroid clusters, RICP revealed diagnostically relevant features such as nucleoli, lipid droplets, and nuclear irregularities, and hue-saturation analysis quantitatively differentiated cytological categories. This perceptually grounded, label-free framework bridges conventional color cytology and quantitative optical imaging for improved diagnostic precision.</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal study of the post-compressed high-power laser pulses for coherent extreme ultraviolet source development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compared the performance of two post-compression techniques, a gas-filled hollow-core fiber (HCF) and a multi-pass cell (MPC), using a high-power ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The HCF produced 27 fs pulses from 230 fs inputs at &gt;50% efficiency, whereas the MPC achieved 34 fs pulses with significantly higher efficiency (&gt;88%). Both results aligned well with numerical simulations. Crucially, spatial wavefront analysis revealed that the HCF acts as a modal filter, improving beam quality, whereas the MPC introduces aberrations through cumulative mirror errors. Furthermore, we characterize the photon flux of high harmonic generation driven by the post-compressed pulses from the HCF and MPC. These finding highlights that post-compression technique based on self-phase modulation is efficient for the intensity boosting of femtosecond laser system, providing opportunities for generating high quality extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources. In addition, further improvement of spatial wavefront quality is suggested using the HCF as a single compressor or output component of the cascade compressor.</description>

      <title>Protected Ion Beam Fabrication of Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides based Photonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are pivotal for next-generation photonic devices due to their exceptional optical properties and strong light-matter interactions. However, their atomic thinness renders them susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam technology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring optoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the target region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the critical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric encapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage, leading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned microstructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer that absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the underlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct patterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion implantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding ultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This combined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers a robust, cost-effective, and scalable single- step fabrication route for integrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby maintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing quantum technologies and compact optical circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Resolution in Pink Beam Dark Field X-ray Microscopy: Experiments and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pink-beam Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (pDFXM) is a powerful emerging technique for time-resolved studies of microstructure and strain evolution in bulk crystalline materials. In this work, we systematically assess the performance of pDFXM relative to monochromatic DFXM when using a compound refractive lens (CRL) as the objective. Analytical expressions for the spatial and angular resolution are derived and compared with numerical simulations based on geometrical optics and experimental data. The pink-beam configuration provides an increased diffraction intensity depending on the deformation state of the sample, accompanied by a general tenfold degradation in angular resolution along the rocking and longitudinal directions. This trade-off is disadvantageous for axial strain mapping, but can be advantageous in cases where integrated intensities are needed. For a perfect crystal under parallel illumination with a pink beam, our results show that chromatic aberration is absent, whereas under condensed illumination it becomes significant. The aberration is shown to depend strongly on the local distortion of the crystal. Weak-beam imaging conditions, such as those required for resolving dislocations, are shown to remain feasible under pink-beam operation and may even provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The higher incident flux, enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude, is quantified in terms of beam heating effects, and implications for optimized scanning protocols are discussed.</description>

      <title>High-order Mie resonance and transient field enhancement in laser-driven plasma nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate substantial field enhancement in plasma nanoshells through high-order Mie resonances using combined Mie theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Optimal shell geometries yield approximately threefold electric field enhancement for 800 nm irradiation, with transient buildup times of tens of femtoseconds before plasma expansion disrupts resonance. Few-cycle pulses produce reduced enhancement due to insufficient resonance establishment. These findings enable optimized laser-plasma interactions for applications including diagnostics of laser-cluster interaction and energetic ion production from engineered core-shell targets, highlighting the critical role of temporal dynamics in nanoplasma resonances.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics in equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</description>

      <title>Generation and detection of squeezed states via a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating at 93 MHz is used to generate squeezed states at 1035 nm. The system features a counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup. Measured squeezing levels up to -3.3 dB are achieved, corresponding to -5.7 dB at SPOPO output, evidencing the robustness and versatility of this platform for stable pulsed squeezed-light generation and advanced quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Bi-isotropic effects on hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $\alpha$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Field enhancement of intense laser pulses in a subwavelength plasma aperture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of intense, ultra-short laser pulses with nanostructures offers promising avenues for spatiotemporal light control. While enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength apertures has been extensively studied in the linear regime, its extension to ultrashort, high-intensity pulses remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate, through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, significant field enhancement of intense laser pulses in subwavelength plasma apertures. The enhancement exhibits a non-resonant character, remaining robust across a wide range of plasma densities and saturating above approximately $20n_c$, while showing minimal dependence on wall thickness. Analysis of the Poynting vector reveals that energy concentration arises from interference between the incident field and back-scattered longitudinal field components. This size-dependent enhanced transmission in plasma apertures enables potential applications such as plasma-based dichroic filters operating at extreme intensities.</description>

      <title>Giant and Rapidly Switching Intrinsic Chirality Enabled by Toroidal Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD), arising from spin-selective light-matter interactions controlled by chirality, is critical for advanced applications such as chiral imaging and ultrasensitive biosensing. However, CD of chiral natural materials is inherently constrained owing to molecular symmetry and thermodynamic stability. Recently, artificially engineered metasurfaces incorporating chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) have emerged as a promising solution, which enables near-unity CD responses. However, their current designs heavily rely on complex three-dimensional geometries, posing significant challenges for integration with planar on-chip platforms. To address the stringent challenges, we demonstrate a truly planar metasurface that achieves giant intrinsic chiral responses by utilizing a chiral Q-BIC dominated by out-of-plane toroidal dipoles (Tz). With deep-subwavelength ({\lambda}/20) thickness, our metasurface exhibits outstanding intrinsic CD values in both simulations (&gt;0.90) and experiments (~0.80). Moreover, in contrast to previous electric or magnetic chiral Q-BICs, the toroidal Q-BIC produces a rapidly switching CD response - transitioning sharply between positive and negative giant CD values within ~0.2 GHz, and the switching is highly sensitive to small oblique incidence of opposite angles. Therefore, our scheme provides a planar platform for studying chiral light-matter interactions involving toroidal dipoles, important for future development of polarization- and angle-sensitive photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Advancing temporal resolution in computation, signal modulation, and measurement is crucial for pushing the frontiers of modern science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing conventional electronics, yet remain constrained by an inherent trade-off between temporal resolution and operation time -- limiting performance to the picosecond scale. Here we show that atoms and molecules can overcome this limitation, enabling attosecond-level temporal resolution with over 100,000-fold higher precision than state-of-the-art optical resonators while sustaining long operation times. When resonantly driven, these systems naturally perform temporal integration of the incident field envelope -- a process verified by solving the Bloch equations using four independent formulations in excellent agreement with analytic predictions. We identify feasible atomic transitions and excitation schemes realizable with current technology. Furthermore, we suggest techniques to differentiate and generate waveforms at such resolution. These results establish a new paradigm for attosecond-resolution optical computation, signal modulation, and ultrafast control in atomic and quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>

      <title>Dual-Bus Resonator for Multi-Port Spectral Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24267</link>

Abstract: Microresonators are essential in integrated photonics, enabling optical filters, modulators, sensors, and frequency converters. Their spectral response is governed by bus-to-resonator coupling, typically classified as under-, critical-, or over-coupling. Conventional single-bus designs inevitably link the conditions for critical coupling, a transmission zero, and maximum intra-cavity power, preventing independent control of these phenomena and restricting the ability to engineer coupling regimes and resonance lineshapes. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a dual-bus racetrack resonator that breaks this constraint. Our design demonstrates complementary channel-specific coupling regimes and enables wavelength-dependent Lorentzian-to-Fano lineshaping. We model the device using three-waveguide coupled-mode theory and pole-zero analysis, which reveals that transmission zeros are decoupled from cavity-defined critical coupling and maximum intra-cavity power. Furthermore, the dual-bus scheme operates broadband, spanning visible to mid-infrared across all four transmission channels, highlighting its spectral richness and platform independence. These results establish a general framework for multi-port spectral engineering in integrated photonics, with broad implications for tunable filters, modulators, sensors, and nonlinear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the lantern: coherent, spectro-polarimetric characterisation of a multimode converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25330</link>

Abstract: While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections. Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>
