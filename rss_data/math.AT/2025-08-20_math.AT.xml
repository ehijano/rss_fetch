      <title>Homotopy types of S^{2k-1}-bundles over S^{2k}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the new necessary and sufficient conditions on the attaching map $f$ of the top cell of a CW-complex having the homotopy type of the total space of $S^{2k-1}$-fibration over $S^{2k}$ for any $k\geq 2$. As an application, we give the homotopy classification of the $S^{2k-1}$-bundles over $S^{2k}$ for some specific numbers $k\geq 2$ in our subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Chow-Witt Rings of Classifying Spaces of Products of Multiplicative and Cyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the total Chow-Witt rings of the classifying space B\mu_n of the roots of unity, as well as the products BG_m x B\mu_n and B\mu_m x B\mu_n for all m,n greater than or equal to 1 based on the strategy by di Lorenzo and Mantovani (2023) for B\mu_n with n even. Moreover we compute the total I^j-cohomology and Chow-Witt rings of P^q x P^r for all q,r greater than or equal to 1 and of BG_m x BG_m.</description>

      <title>On Topology of the Infinite-Dimensional Space of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work serves as an opening and basis of an ongoing program investigating topological and geometric aspects of the moduli space of smooth fiberings on a manifold. The present paper focuses on the algebraic and differential topology of this space, and particularly addresses the following three quests in a top-down manner: the classification, for each class the path components, and for each component the homotopy type (as loosely analogous to the those three for studying the moduli of smooth structures: exotic manifolds, mapping class groups, and Smale-type conjectures). The last of the three is infinite-dimensional in nature, as the corresponding moduli space is shown to inherit the structure of a smooth Fr\'echet manifold from the diffeomorphism group through a (infinite-dimensional) principal bundle, with which we establish further connections with the Lie theory of gauge symmetries from one perspective, and with the geometric analysis of extrinsic flows from another. Concretely, we tackle the problem of finding the "homotopy core": a minimal deformation retract that encodes the topological structure of such a moduli space of fibrations; as our first examples, we gave explicit homotopy calculations for various low-dimensional cases which, combined with earlier known cases from others' work, complete the solution to this problem for dimensions up to three.</description>

      <title>Replacing functors with enriched ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe simple criteria under which a given functor is naturally equivalent to an enriched one. We do this for several bases of enrichment, namely (pointed) simplicial sets, (pointed) topological spaces and orthogonal spectra. We also describe a few corollaries, such as a new proof of a result of Lurie on Dwyer-Kan localizations.</description>

      <title>Anick's conjecture for polyhedral products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that localised away from a finite set of primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a product of loops on spheres. This verifies a conjecture of Anick for such spaces. We also develop a method to reduce the study of the loops of more general polyhedral products to that of the loops on a moment-angle complex. As a consequence, we give $p$-local loop space decompositions of quasitoric manifolds, certain toric orbifolds and a wide family of polyhedral products. We also describe the additive structure of loop homology of simply connected polyhedral products in terms of polynomials studied by Backelin and Berglund.</description>

      <title>Flagifying the Dowker Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dowker complex $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ is a simplicial complex capturing the topological interplay between two finite sets $X$ and $Y$ under some relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$. While its definition is asymmetric, the famous Dowker duality states that $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{D}_{R}(Y,X)$ have homotopy equivalent geometric realizations. We introduce the Dowker-Rips complex $\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y)$, defined as the flagification of the Dowker complex or, equivalently, as the maximal simplicial complex whose $1$-skeleton coincides with that of $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$. This is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, since as a flag complex, the Dowker-Rips complex is less expensive to compute than the Dowker complex. While the Dowker duality does not hold for Dowker-Rips complexes in general, we show that one still has that $\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y))\cong\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(Y,X))$ for $i=0,1$. We further show that this weakened duality extends to the setting of persistent homology, and quantify the ``failure" of the Dowker duality in homological dimensions higher than $1$ by means of interleavings. This makes the Dowker-Rips complex a less expensive, approximate version of the Dowker complex that is usable in topological data analysis. Indeed, we provide a Python implementation of the Dowker-Rips complex and, as an application, we show that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Dowker complex in a tumor microenvironment classification pipeline. In that pipeline, using the Dowker-Rips complex leads to increase in speed while retaining classification performance.</description>

      <title>On the homology description of equivariant unoriented bordism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a chain complex $\mathfrak{B}$ based on a double complex derived from the universal complex $X(\mathbb{Z}_2^n)$. It is shown that $\mathfrak{B}$ has a nontrivial homology only in degree $n-2$, which is isomorphic to the equivariant unoriented bordism group $\mathcal{Z}_{n+1}(\mathbb{Z}_2^n)$ of all $(n+1)$-dimensional smooth closed $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds with isolated fixed points. By analyzing the spectral sequence of $\mathfrak{B}$, we derive a dimension formula for $\mathcal{Z}_{n+1}(\mathbb{Z}_2^n)$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector space, which agrees with a recent result for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Approximate Circle Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce discrete approximate circle bundles, a class of objects designed to serve as the data science analog of circle bundles from algebraic topology. We show that, under appropriate conditions, one can meaningfully and stably identify a discrete approximate circle bundle with an isomorphism class of true circle bundles. We also describe two cohomology invariants which uniquely determine the isomorphism class of a circle bundle, and provide algorithms to compute them given a discrete approximate representative. Finally, we propose a novel methodology for coordinatization and dimensionality reduction of circle bundle data. To illustrate the practical utility and viability of our algorithms, we present applications to both real and synthetic datasets from computer vision (e.g., modeling optical flow).</description>

      <title>Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on To\"en's work on affine stacks, we develop a certain homotopy theory for schemes, which we call "unipotent homotopy theory." Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we prove that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ introduced in our paper recover the unipotent Nori fundamental group scheme, the $p$-adic \'etale homotopy groups, as well as certain formal groups introduced by Artin and Mazur. We prove a version of the classical Freudenthal suspension theorem as well as a profiniteness theorem for unipotent homotopy group schemes. We also introduce the notion of a formal sphere and use it to show that for Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension $n$, the group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ are derived invariants for all $i \ge 0$; the case $i=n$ is related to recent work of Antieau and Bragg involving topological Hochschild homology. Using the unipotent homotopy group schemes, we establish a correspondence between formal Lie groups and certain higher algebraic structures.</description>
