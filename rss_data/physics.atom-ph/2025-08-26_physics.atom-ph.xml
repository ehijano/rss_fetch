      <title>Ionization of atoms by dense and compact beams of extreme relativistic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization is one of the basic physical processes, occurring when charged particles penetrate atomic matter. When atoms are bombarded by very dense and compact beams of extreme relativistic electrons, two qualitatively new -- and very efficient -- ionization mechanisms arise: the tunnel or over-barrier ionization and the coherent impact ionization, which are driven by the low- and high-frequency parts, respectively, of the beam field. In these mechanisms significant fractions of the beam electrons act coherently, strongly enhancing the ionization process. They are also very sensitive to the spatiotemporal structure of the beam that can be used for analysing the beam properties.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Thermal Fields on Rydberg Atom Radio Frequency Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors are unique in a number of ways, including possessing extraordinary carrier bandwidth, self-calibration and accuracy. In this paper, we examine the impact of thermal radiation on Rydberg atom sensors. Antennas are limited by their thermal background, while Rydberg atom sensors are coherent sensors. Incoherent thermal radiation does not limit Rydberg atom sensors in the same way as an antenna. The primary consequence of a thermal radiation field on Rydberg atom sensors is to decrease their coherence, as the decay rates of the Rydberg states used for sensing the radio frequency field are increased due to the thermal field, i.e. blackbody, modification of the atomic decay rates. Thermal and coherent field excitation are fundamentally different in that thermal fields produce statistically independent excitations with well-defined frequency, polarization, and propagation direction, while coherent states are coherent superpositions of photon number states. Consequently, thermal fields do not contribute to the coherences of the density matrix that are used for Rydberg atom sensing, except for damping them.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Under-Sampling Effect for AI-based Dynamic Gravimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometer (AI)-based dynamic gravimeter enable high-precision absolute gravity measurements, crucial for applications in geophysics, navigation, resource exploration, and metrology. Understanding their underlying mechanisms and minimizing measurement noise are essential for enhancing performance. This work investigates the gravity measurement noise in AI-based systems induced by the under-sampling time of the classical accelerometer. Using actual dynamic gravity measurement data, we demonstrate that an under-sampling time of 0.12 s introduces significant gravity measurement noise of 8 mGal. To elucidate the mechanism of this noise, we derive a formula for this noise in frequency domain, identifying high-frequency aliasing as its source. Analysis of the derived expressions indicates that reducing the under-sampling time duration and suppressing the high-frequency noise of the acceleration are effective strategies for mitigating this noise. This work provides significant insights for noise analysis and future scheme design of AI-based dynamic gravimeters.</description>

      <title>Dual-Frequency Absorption Spectroscopy in Laser-Cooled Rubidium Atoms: Theoretical Modeling and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate dual-frequency absorption spectroscopy (DFAS) using laser-cooled 87Rb and 85Rb atoms. Doppler-free resonances with high-contrast are produced, which suggest the suitability of using dual-frequency absorption spectroscopy (DFAS) for laser stabilization in a cold-atom-based coherent population trapping (CPT) clock, and for developing a compact, high-performance optical frequency standard using an integrated magneto-optical trap (MOT). We developed a model using density-matrix equations to accurately simulate DFAS in the atomic medium without applying any simplifying approximations. Comprehensive simulations are performed using our multi-level system model to analyze dual-frequency spectra produced in cold atom ensembles under different experimental conditions, including the effect of magnetic field, and two-photon detuning. The simulations accurately yield amplitudes, linewidths, frequency shifts, and lineshapes of DFAS resonances under these experimental conditions. We also demonstrate a simple mechanism for performing CPT spectroscopy by implementing a DFAS laser lock using trapped atoms in the MOT. Additionally, we have extended our model to accurately model the dual-frequency spectrum produced in rubidium cell, which is a medium of practical interest for vapor-cell-based quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Rydberg Atomic Electrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal electrometer should measure electric fields accurately while causing minimal disturbance to the field itself. Rydberg atomic electrometers are promising candidates for ideal electrometry due to their SI traceability and non-invasive nature. However, in practice, the atomic vapor cell shell can distort the electric field, limiting the device's performance. In this work, we overcome this challenge by fabricating a chip-scale vapor cell using a novel combination of femtosecond laser writing and optical contact. This method enables the development of a non-invasive atomic electrometer with a radar cross-section (RCS) 20 dB lower than that of commercial atomic cell-based electrometers. Furthermore, we observe a new sub-Doppler spectral narrowing phenomenon in these chip-scale cells. The effect originates from an incoherent, collision-driven mechanism--hereafter referred to as incoherent Dicke narrowing (ICDN). This advancement supports future revisions to the international system of units and broadens applications in metrology and quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>Molecular Tools for Non-Planar Surface Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigations of on-surface chemistry on passivated silicon have only shown in-plane chemical reactions, and studies on bare silicon are limited in facilitating additional reactions post-molecular-attachment. Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100) through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific "molecular tools". Following an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework, a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled on silicon.</description>

      <title>Optical formation of ultracold NaK$_2$ ground state molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rovibronic transitions in NaK$_2$ between its electronic ground state $1^2A'$ and its second excited state $3^2A'$, to identify possible pathways for the creation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules. Our methodology relies on the computation of potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moment surfaces for the relevant electronic states using ab initio methods. Rovibrational energy levels and wave functions are determined using the discrete variable representation approach. A double-well structure of the potential energy surface is identified for both states, and the related transition strengths between the rovibrational levels are derived. Our calculations show that the formation of ultracold ground-state NaK$_2$ molecules is expected when starting from an excited electronic state of NaK$_2$, which can be created by photoassociation of NaK and K observed by optical means by Cao et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2024, 132, 093403).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ab initio calculations of one-electron quantum electrodynamical corrections to the second-order Zeeman splitting for the $1s_{1/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$, and $2p_{1/2}$ states in highly charged hydrogen-like ions. The self-energy correction is evaluated using the rigorous QED approach. The vacuum polarization correction is evaluated within the electric-loop approximation. Calculations are performed for the wide range of nuclear charge number: $Z = 14 - 92$.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Parallel assembly of neutral atom arrays with an SLM using linear phase interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every few ms, limited by technology. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.996(2) per rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>
