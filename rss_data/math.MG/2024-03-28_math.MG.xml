      <title>Connections between metric differentiability and rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine Kirchheim's metric differentials with Cheeger charts in order to establish a non-embeddability principle for any collection $\mathcal C$ of Banach (or metric) spaces: if a metric measure space $X$ bi-Lipschitz embeds in some element in $\mathcal C$, and if every Lipschitz map $X\to Y\in \mathcal C$ is differentiable, then $X$ is rectifiable. This gives a simple proof of the rectifiability of Lipschitz differentiability spaces that are bi-Lipschitz embeddable in Euclidean space, due to Kell--Mondino. Our principle also implies a converse to Kirchheim's theorem: if all Lipschitz maps from a domain space to arbitrary targets are metrically differentiable, the domain is rectifiable. We moreover establish the compatibility of metric and w$^*$-differentials of maps from metric spaces in the spirit of Ambrosio--Kirchheim.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert metric for bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded symmetric domains carry several natural invariant metrics, for example the Carath\'eodory, Kobayashi or the Bergman metric. We define another natural metric, from generalized Hilbert metric defined in [FGW20], by considering the Borel embedding of the domain as an open subset of its dual compact Hermitian symmetric space and then its Harish-Chandra realization in projective spaces. We describe this construction on the four classical families of bounded symmetric domains and compute both this metric and its associated Finsler metric. We compare it to Carath\'eodory and Bergman metrics and show that, except for the complex hyperbolic space, those metrics differ.</description>

      <title>Submanifolds with boundary and Stokes' Theorem in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of $C^1_\mathbb{H}$-regular submanifold with boundary in sub-Riemannian Heisenberg groups. As an application, we prove a version of Stokes' Theorem for $C^1_\mathbb{H}$-regular submanifolds with boundary that takes into account Rumin's complex of differential forms in Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. This problem, which has a long history, has found applications in science and technology. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. To the best of our knowledge these fundamental issues have not received much attention. In particular, we present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP relative to these subsets. These conditions are related to the structure of the boundaries of the subsets, their relative orientation, and the structure of the unit sphere of the space. In addition, we present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP, possibly without convexity . Our results allow us to significantly extend the horizon of the recent alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke (A-S-HLWB) algorithm [Censor, Mansour and Reem, The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets, arXiv:2304.09600 (2023)] for solving the BAP problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Steinitz theorem and polarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Steinitz theorem asserts that if the origin lies within the interior of the convex hull of a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, then there are at most $2d$ points in $S$ whose convex hull contains the origin within its interior. B\'ar\'any, Katchalski, and Pach established a quantitative version of Steinitz's theorem, showing that for a convex polytope $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ containing the standard Euclidean unit ball $\mathbf{B}^d$, there exist at most $2d$ vertices of $Q$ whose convex hull $Q'$ satisfies $r\mathbf{B}^d \subset Q' $ with $r \geq d^{-2d}$. Recently, M\'arton Nasz\'odi and the author derived a polynomial bound on $r$.
  This paper aims to establish a bound on $r$ based on the number of vertices of $Q.$ In other words, we demonstrate an effective method to remove several points from the original set $Q$ without significantly altering the bound on $r$. Specifically, if the number of vertices of $Q$ scales linearly with the dimension, i.e., $cd$, then one can select $2d$ vertices such that $r \geq \frac{1}{5cd}$. The proof relies on a polarity trick, which may be of independent interest: we demonstrate the existence of a point $p$ in the interior of a convex polytope $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that the vertices of the polar polytope $(P-p)^\circ$ sum up to zero.</description>
