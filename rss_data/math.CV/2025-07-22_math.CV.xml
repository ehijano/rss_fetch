      <title>The Ahlfors-Weill reflection on convex domains and Nehari quasidisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimate $$\RR\{a_2f\}&gt;-\frac12$$ derived for convex mappings in \cite{FMR}, is interpreted here in terms of the Ahlfors-Weill reflection to show that for such domains $\Om$, the mediatrix of the segment $[w, \mR_w]$ joining a point $w\in\Om$ and its reflection $\mR_w$ lies always outside $\Om$. In particular, the midpoint of the segment is also outside $\Om$. We determine the extremal cases when such a midpoint can lie of the boundary $\partial\Om$. The normalization $\fd=\frac{f}{1+a_2f}$ to a M\"obius equivalent mapping with vanishing second coefficient leads to important distinctions between bounded an unbounded domains. We finally derive a geometric characterization of Nehari quasidisks in terms of the distance to the boundary of the Ahlfors-Weill reflection.</description>

      <title>The distance function and Lipschitz classes of mappings between metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate when the local Lipschitz property of the real-valued function $g(z) = d_Y (f(z),A)$ implies the global Lipschitz property of the mapping $f:X\to Y$ between the metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$. Here, $d_Y(y,A)$ denotes the distance of $y\in Y$ from the non-empty set $\subseteq Y$. As a consequence, we find that an analytic function on a uniform domain of a normed space belongs to the Lipschitz class if and only if its modulus satisfies the same condition; in the case of the unit disk this result is proved by K. Dyakonov. We use the recently established version of a classical theorem by Hardy and Littlewood for mappings between metric spaces. This paper is a continuation of the recent article by the author [14].</description>

      <title>A condition equivalent to the H\"{o}lder continuity of harmonic functions on unbounded Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result concerns the behavior of bounded harmonic functions on a domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ which may be represented as a strict epigraph of a Lipschitz function on $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$. Generally speaking, the result says that the H\"{o}lder continuity of a harmonic function on such a domain is equivalent to the uniform H\"{o}lder continuity along the straight lines determined by the vector $\mathbf{e}_N$, where $\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\dots,\mathbf {e}_N$ is the base of standard vectors in $\mathbb{R}^N$.
  More precisely, let $\Psi$ be a Lipschitz function on $\mathbb {R}^{N-1}$, and $U$ be a real-valued bounded harmonic function on $E_\Psi=\{(x',x_N): x'\in\mathbb{R}^{N-1}, x_N&gt;\Psi(x')\}$. We show that for $\alpha\in(0,1)$ the following two conditions on $U$ are equivalent:
  (a) There exists a constant $C$ such that \begin{equation*} | U(x',x_N) - U(x',y_N)|\le C |x_N - y_N|^\alpha,\quad x'\in \mathbb {R}^{N-1}, x_N, y_N &gt; \Psi (x'); \end{equation*}
  (b) There exists a constant $\tilde {C}$ such that \begin{equation*} |U(x) - U (y)|\le \tilde{C} |x-y|^\alpha,\quad x, y\in E_\Psi. \end{equation*} Moreover, the constant $\tilde {C}$ depends linearly on $C$.
  The result holds as well for vector-valued harmonic functions and, therefore, for analytic mappings.</description>

      <title>On a dense set of functions determined by sampled Gabor magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a function from the magnitude of its Gabor transform sampled on a discrete set. While it is known that uniqueness fails for general square integrable functions, we show that phase retrieval is possible for a dense class of signals: specifically, those whose Bargmann transforms are entire functions of exponential type. Our main result characterises when such functions can be uniquely recovered (up to a global phase) from magnitude only data sampled on uniformly discrete sets of sufficient lower Beurling density. In particular, we prove that every entire function of exponential type is uniquely determined (up to a global phase) among all second order entire functions by its modulus on a sufficiently dense shifted lattice.</description>

      <title>Numerical conformal mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal mapping may be the best-known topic in complex analysis. Any simply connected nonempty domain $\Omega$ in the complex plane ${{\mathbb{C}}}$ (assuming $\Omega\ne {{\mathbb{C}}}$) can be mapped bijectively to the unit disk by an analytic function with nonvanishing derivative, as in Figure 1. If $\Omega$ is doubly-connected, it can be mapped to a circular annulus $1&lt;|z|&lt;R$ for some $R$, called the conformal modulus, which is uniquely determined by $\Omega$, as in Figure 2. If $\Omega$ has connectivity higher than $2$, it can be mapped onto various canonical domains such as a disk with exclusions in the form of slits or smaller disks, as in Figure 3.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study analytic self-maps of the unit disk for which the hyperbolic diameters of the images of hyperbolic balls of radius 1 are uniformly bounded below. We give several characterizations of such maps involving the behaviour along geodesic rays, Aleksandrov-Clark measures, zero sets and critical sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Tauberian theorem concerning power series admitting square root singularities. More precisely we give an asymptotic expansion to any order of the coefficients of a power series admitting square-root type singularities. This article is one of a triptych with [Che25b] and [Che25c] that aims at proving an asympototic expansion to any order of the passage probability of an irreducible finite range random walk on free groups.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

      <title>Spectral bundles on Abelian varieties, complex projective spaces and Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the spectral analysis of Bochner-Kodaira Laplacians on an Abelian variety, complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ and a Grassmannian with a holomorphic line bundle. By imitating the method of creation and annihilation operators in physics, we convert those eigensections (of the \textquotedblleft higher energy" level) into holomorphic sections (of the \textquotedblleft lowest energy" level). This enables us to endow these spectral bundles, which are defined over the dual Abelian variety, with natural holomorphic structure. Using this conversion expressed in a concrete way, all the higher eigensections are explicitly expressible using holomorphic sections formed by theta functions. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the dimension of the space of higher-level eigensections on $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ through vanishing theorems and the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. These give a theoretical study related to some problems newly discussed by string theorists using numerical analysis. Some partial results on Grassmannians are proved and some directions for future research are indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hexablock is a domain arising from a special case of the $\mu$-synthesis problem. We study the commuting operator tuples having the hexablock as a spectral set. Such a tuple is called a hexablock-contraction or simply $\mathbb H$-contraction. We characterize the unitaries and isometries associated with $\mathbb H$-contractions. Two different types of dilation results for $\mathbb H$-contractions are obtained. We find connection of this theory with the operators associated with the symmetrized bidisc and tetrablock, two other domains related to the $\mu$-synthesis problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal polynomial approximants and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. An electrostatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between two seemingly distant fields: the set of cyclic functions $f$ in a Hilbert space of analytic functions over the unit disc $\D$, on the one hand, and the families of orthogonal polynomials for a weight on the unit circle $\T$ (OPUC), on the other. This link is established by so-called Optimal Polynomial Approximants (OPA) to $1/f$, that is, polynomials $p_n$ minimizing the norm of $1-p_nf$, among all polynomials $p_n$ of degree up to a given $n$.
  Here, we focus on the particular case of the Hardy space, and an electrostatic interpretation of the zeros of those OPA (and thus, of the corresponding OPUC) is studied. We find the electrostatic laws explaining the position of such zeros for a reduced but significant class of examples. This represents the first step towards a research plan proposed over a decade ago to understand zeros of OPA through their potential theoretic properties.</description>

Abstract: For trigonometric series and series of Chebyshev polynomials, we defined trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e and Hermite-Jacobi approximations, linear and nonlinear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations. We established criterion of the existence and uniqueness of trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials, associated with an arbitrary set of $k$ trigonometric series, and we found explicit form of these polynomials. Similar results were obtained for linear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations. We made examples of systems of functions for which trigonometrical Hermite-Jacobi approximations are existed but aren't the same as trigonometric Hermite-Pad\'e approximations. Similar examples were made for linear and nonlinear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a conjugate $(1/q, q)$-harmonic homogeneous polynomial $V_k$ of degree $k$ to a given $(1/q, q)$-harmonic homogeneous polynomial $U_k$ of degree $k.$ The conjugated harmonic polynomials $V_k$ and $U_k$ are associated to the $(1/q, q)$-mono\-genic polynomial $F = U_k + \overline{e}_0V. $ We investigate conjugate $(1/q, q)$-harmonic homogeneous polynomials in the setting of $q$-Clifford analysis. Starting from a given $(1/q, q)$-harmonic polynomial $U_k$ of degree $k$, we construct its conjugate counterpart $V_k$, such that the Clifford-valued polynomial $F = U_k + e_0 V_k$ is $(1/q, q)$-monogenic, i.e., a null solution of a generalized $q$-Dirac operator. Our construction relies on a combination of Jackson-type integration, Fischer decomposition, and the resolution of a $q$-Poisson equation. We further establish existence and uniqueness results, and provide explicit representations for conjugate pairs, particularly when $U_k$ is real-valued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic polynomials vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic polynomial in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some presumably new constructions of nontrivial harmonic functions whose zero sets are unions of affine subspaces.</description>

Abstract: We define multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ as the conditional law of the remainder of a partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. The strands of a multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ have a random link pattern, and their law conditionally on the linking pattern is a (global) multichordal SLE$_\kappa$. The multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ are the conjectural scaling limits of FK and loop $O(n)$ models with some wiring patterns of the boundary arcs.
  We also explain how CLE$_\kappa$ configurations can be locally resampled, and show that the partially explored strands can be relinked in any possible way with positive probability. We will also establish several other estimates for partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. Altogether, these relationships and results serve to provide a toolbox for studying CLE$_\kappa$ and global multiple SLE$_\kappa$.</description>
