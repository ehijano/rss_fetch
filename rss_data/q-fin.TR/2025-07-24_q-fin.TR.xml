      <title>Modeling for the Growth of Unorganized Retailing in the Presence of Organized and E-Retailing in Indian Pharmaceutical Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study considers the rural pharmaceutical retail sector in India, where the arrival of organized retailers and e-retailers is testing the survival strategies of unorganized retailers. Grounded in a field investigation of the Indian pharmaceutical retail sector, this study integrates primary data collection, consumer conjoint analysis and design of experiments to develop an empirically grounded agent-based simulation of multi-channel competition among unorganized, organized and e-pharmaceutical retailers. The results of the conjoint analysis reveal that store attributes of price discount, quality of products offered, variety of assortment, and degree of personalized service, and customer attributes of distance, degree of mobility, and degree of emergency are key determinants of optimal store choice strategies. The primary insight obtained from the agent-based modeling is that the attribute levels of each individual retailer have some effect on other retailers performance. The field-calibrated simulation also evidenced counterintuitive behavior that an increase in unorganized price discounts initially leads to an increase in average footprint at unorganized retailers, but eventually leads to these retailers moving out of the market. Hence, the unorganized retailers should not increase the price discount offered beyond a tipping point or it will be detrimental to them. Another counterintuitive behavior found was that high emergency customers give less importance to variety of assortment than low emergency customers. This study aids in understanding the levers for policy design towards improving the competition dynamics among retail channels in the pharmaceutical retail sector in India.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trading under Instantaneous and Persistent Price Impact, Predictable Returns and Multiscale Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic portfolio optimization problem that incorporates predictable returns, instantaneous transaction costs, price impact, and stochastic volatility, extending the classical results of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), which assume constant volatility. Constructing the optimal portfolio strategy in this general setting is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. To address this, we propose a multi-scale volatility expansion that captures stochastic volatility dynamics across different time scales. Specifically, the analysis involves a singular perturbation for the fast mean-reverting volatility factor and a regular perturbation for the slow-moving factor. We also introduce an approximation for small price impact and demonstrate its numerical accuracy. We formally derive asymptotic approximations up to second order and use Monte Carlo simulations to show how incorporating these corrections improves the Profit and Loss (PnL) of the resulting portfolio strategy.</description>

      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility: A Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory observations in market microstructure: is the famous "square-root law" of metaorder impact, which decays with time, compatible with the random-walk nature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely explain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders that mechanically impact them? We introduce a new theoretical framework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes q of individual trades, we further introduce two q-dependent exponents, which allow us to describe how the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scale with T. We predict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion on a parameter a, which allows one to put the same weight on all child orders or to overweight large ones, a behaviour that is clearly borne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price changes and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of a, which again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and data suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the heart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue that our results support the "Order-Driven" theory of excess volatility, and are at odds with the idea that a "Fundamental" component accounts for a large share of the volatility of financial markets.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making and Arbitrage Profits in the Presence of Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of trading fees on the profits of arbitrageurs trading against an automated market maker (AMM) or, equivalently, on the adverse selection incurred by liquidity providers (LPs) due to arbitrage. We extend the model of Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class of two asset AMMs to introduce both fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our setting, we are able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in closed form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the impact of fees takes a particularly simple form: fees simply scale down arbitrage profits by the fraction of blocks which present profitable trading opportunities to arbitrageurs. This fraction decreases with an increasing block rate, hence our model yields an important practical insight: faster blockchains will result in reduced LP losses. Further introducing gas fees (fixed costs) in our model, we show that, in the fast block asymptotic regime, lower gas fees lead to smaller losses for LPs.</description>
