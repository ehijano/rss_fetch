      <title>PDMS elastic properties: influence of fabrication protocol and test method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicone rubbers have been integral to the rapid development of microfluidic devices and flexible electronics in recent decades. Polydimethylsiloxane, commonly abbreviated as PDMS and produced using the brand name Dow SYLGARD 184, is a ubiquitous such rubber that is renowned for its ease of manufacturing and biocompatibility. SYLGARD 184 is a soft polymer frequently used in the field of mechanics, microfluidics, and electronics given the straightforward ability to manipulate its material properties via tuning base to curing agent mix ratios and curing schedules. However, this tuning process largely occurs on a case by case basis via trial and error, without a comprehensive understanding of how composition, temperature, or mechanical test method my alter the measured elasticity. Here we compare the reported elastic response of PDMS SYLGARD 184 obtained using a range of mechanical testing methods and compositions to investigate the variability. We also include previously unreported experimental results obtained in our lab using Volume Controlled Cavitation Expansion (VCCE). Both testing method and cure schedule (time and temperature of curing) are found to strongly influence the measured elastic response resulting in shear moduli that range over 3 orders of magnitude for chemical compositions that are reported to be the same. While tension testing is a common test method in mechanical analysis, the wide ranging moduli for stiff PDMS and complete inability to measure softer PDMS compositions reveal the limits of this standard method. As researchers in the field of mechanics strive to quantify the properties of increasingly complex biological and composite materials, converging on a standardized measurement of PDMS is necessary, and is a necessary first step for the community.</description>

      <title>Strategy of a separation technique for different particles with the same size and zeta potential: Application of non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we use knowledge gained from our recent study to present a technique for separation of nanoparticles such as exosomes, anticancer drugs, and vaccines. The technique involves adding non-adsorptive polymers to a system in which two types of nanoparticles with the same size and zeta potential are dispersed. The different types of nanoparticles can be separated based on differences in their hydrophobicities and softness of the polymer. Using the non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory and assuming a realistic model system, we were able to separate the two types of the particles with the same size and zeta potential in the model system.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the power spectral density of a fluctuating colloidal current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of molecules through biological and synthetic nanopores is governed by multiple stochastic processes that lead to noisy, fluctuating currents. Disentangling the characteristics of different noise-generating mechanisms is thus central to better understanding molecular transport at a fundamental level. Here, we study current noise experimentally at the single particle level by imaging colloidal particles driven through microfluidic channels by a difference in fluid pressure. In this scenario, currents fluctuate due to the random arrival times of particles into the channel and the distribution of particle speeds within the channel. We find that this results in a characteristic form of the power spectral density of the current, scaling as ~f^0, at low frequencies and ~1/f^2 at high frequencies. To rationalise these scalings, we extend a model for shot noise with a finite transit time, borrowed from electronic circuit theory, to include the experimental distribution of transit times and compare this model to the experimental spectra. We find excellent agreement between the data and model across a range of driving pressures within an advection-dominated regime, thereby establishing concrete links between the power spectra scalings and underlying mechanisms for this experimental system. This paves the way for establishing a more systematic understanding of the links between features of power spectra and underlying molecular mechanisms in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal pair interactions and emergent activity mediated by scattered waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles that scatter waves interact through the waves they scatter. Using acoustically levitated spheres as a model system, we show that wave-mediated pair interactions are nonreciprocal except under a limited set of circumstances. This apparent violation of Newton's third law is allowed because the pair of particles does not constitute a closed system; the sound wave carries away the balance of the system's momentum and angular momentum. The nonreciprocity of wave-mediated interactions is significant because it enables collections of scatterers to transduce energy out of the wave and use it to power their own motion. Such wave-matter composite systems display a form of activity that is an emergent property of their state of organization. We demonstrate emergent activity arising from nonreciprocal wave-mediated interactions through experiments and simulations on trios of acoustically levitated beads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy production in run-and-tumble models. After presenting the general formalism in the framework of the Fokker-Planck equations in one space dimension, we derive some known exact results in simple physical situations (free run-and-tumble particles and harmonic confinement). We then extend the calculation to the case of anisotropic motion (different speeds and tumbling rates for right and left oriented particles), obtaining exact expressions of the entropy production rate. We conclude by discussing the general case of heterogeneous run-and-tumble motion described by space-dependent parameters and extending the analysis to the case of d-dimensional motions.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Measuring vesicle loading with holographic microscopy and bulk light scattering</title>

Abstract: We report efforts to quantify the loading of cell-sized lipid vesicles using in-line digital holographic microscopy. This method does not require fluorescent reporters, fluorescent tracers, or radioactive tracers. A single-color LED light source takes the place of conventional illumination to generate holograms rather than bright field images. By modelling the vesicle's scattering in a microscope with a Lorenz-Mie light scattering model, and comparing the results to data holograms, we are able to measure the vesicle's refractive index and thus loading. Performing the same comparison for bulk light scattering measurements enables retrieval of vesicle loading for nanoscale vesicles.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bubble transport in porous electrodes and catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and transport of gas bubbles across a model porous catalyst/electrode using lattice Boltzmann simulations. This approach enables us to systematically examine the influence of a wide range of morphologies, flow velocities, and reaction rates on the efficiency of gas production. By exploring these parameters, we identify critical parameter combinations that significantly contribute to an enhanced yield of gas output. Our simulations reveal the existence of an optimal pore geometry for which the product output is maximized. Intriguingly, we also observe that lower flow velocities improve gas production by leveraging on coalescence-induced bubble detachment from the catalyst.</description>

      <title>Active string fluids and gels formed by dipolar active Brownian particles in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles possessing permanent magnetic dipole moments occur naturally in magnetotactic bacteria and in man-made systems like active colloids or micro-robots. Yet, the interplay between self-propulsion and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on dynamic self-assembly in three dimensions (3D) remains poorly understood. We conduct Brownian dynamics simulations of active dipolar particles in 3D, focusing on the low-density regime, where dipolar hard spheres tend to form chain-like aggregates and percolated networks with increasing dipolar coupling strength. We find that strong active forces override dipolar attractions, effectively inhibiting chain-like aggregation and network formation. Conversely, activating particles with low to moderate forces results in a fluid composed of active chains and rings. At strong dipolar coupling strengths, this active fluid transitions into an active gel, consisting of a percolated network of active chains. Although the overall structure of the active gel remains interconnected, the network experiences more frequent configurational rearrangements due to the reduced bond lifetime of active dipolar particles. Consequently, particles exhibit enhanced translational and rotational diffusion within the active fluid of strings and active gels compared to their passive counterparts. We quantify the influence of activity on aggregates topology, as they transition from branched structures to unconnected chains and rings. Our findings are summarized in a state diagram, delineating the impact of dipolar coupling strength and active force magnitude on the system.</description>

      <title>Effective Action for Dissipative and Nonholonomic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the action of a dynamical system can be supplemented by an effective action for its environment to reproduce arbitrary coordinate dependent ohmic dissipation and gyroscopic forces. The action is a generalization of the harmonic bath model and describes a set of massless interacting scalar fields in an auxiliary space coupled to the original system at the boundary. A certain limit of the model implements nonholonomic constraints. In the case of dynamics with nonlinearly realized symmetries the effective action takes the form of a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-model. It provides a basis for application of path integral methods to general dissipative and nonholonomic systems.</description>

      <title>Flow rate-pressure drop relations for shear-thinning fluids in deformable configurations: theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an experimental framework to measure the flow rate--pressure drop relation for Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids in two common deformable configurations: (\textit{i}) a rectangular channel and (\textit{ii}) an axisymmetric tube. Using the Carreau model to describe the shear-dependent viscosity, we identify the key dimensionless rheological number, $Cu$, which characterizes shear thinning, and we show that our experiments lie within the power-law regime of shear rates. To rationalize the experimental data, we derive the flow rate-pressure drop relation taking into account the two-way-coupled fluid-structure interaction between the flow and its compliant confining boundaries. We thus identify the second key dimensionless number, $\alpha$, which characterizes the compliance of the conduit. We then compare the theoretical flow rate-pressure drop relation to our experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement between the two. We further contrast our results for shear-thinning and Newtonian fluids to highlight the influence of $Cu$ on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. Finally, we delineate four distinct physical regimes of flow and deformation by mapping our experimental flow rate-pressure drop data for Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids into a $Cu-\alpha$ plane.</description>
