      <title>On the Relation of Exact Hydrodynamics to the Chapman--Enskog Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Chapman--Enskog series is locally equivalent to the exact spectral closure defined on slow kinetic eigenmodes in the limit of vanishing Knudsen number. We further show that the Chapman--Enskog series diverges everywhere expect at the global equilibrium for an explicit example, while the exact spectrally closed hydrodynamics are defined globally for any Knudsen number.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional classical superintegrable systems: polynomial algebra of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate generic classical two-dimensional (2D) superintegrable Hamiltonian systems H, characterized by the existence of three functionally independent integrals of motion (I_0=H,I_1,I_2). Our main result, formulated and proved as a theorem, establishes that the set (I_0,I_1,I_2,I_12={I_1,I_2}) generates a four-dimensional polynomial algebra under the Poisson bracket. Unlike previous studies, this study describes a construction that neither depends on the additive separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation nor presupposes polynomial integrals of motion in the canonical momenta. Specifically, we prove an instrumental observation presented in [D. Bonatsos et al., PRA 50, 3700 (1994)] concerning deformed oscillator algebras in superintegrable systems. We apply the method to a variety of physically relevant examples, including the Kepler system, Holt potential, Smorodinsky-Winternitz potential, Fokas-Lagerstrom potential, the Higgs oscillator, and the non-separable Post-Winternitz system. In several cases, we explicitly derive the form of the classical trajectories y=y(x;I_0,I_1,I_2) using purely algebraic means. Moreover, by examining the conditions under which I_1=I_2=0, we identify and characterize special classes of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Changing the discrete spectrum of the half-line matrix Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operator on the half line with the general selfadjoint boundary condition. When the discrete spectrum is changed without changing the continuous spectrum, we present a review of the transformations of the relevant quantities including the regular solution, the Jost solution, the Jost matrix, the scattering matrix, and the boundary matrices used to describe the selfadjoint boundary condition. The changes in the discrete spectrum are considered when an existing bound state is removed, a new bound state is added, and the multiplicity of a bound state is decreased or increased without removing the bound state. We provide various explicit examples to illustrate the theoretical resultspresented.</description>

      <title>The noncommutative residue, divergence theorems and the spectral geometry functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a simple proof of the divergence theorem is given by using the Dirac operator and noncommutative residues. Then we extend the divergence theorem to compact manifolds with boundary by the noncommutative residue of the B-algebra. Furthermore, we present some spectral geometric functionals which we call spectral divergence functionals, and we calculate the spectral divergence functionals of manifolds with (or without) boundary.</description>

      <title>Improved geometric and recollision estimates for the invariance principle of the random Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By improving geometric recollision estimates for a random Lorentz gas, we extend the timescale $T(r)$ of the invariance principle for a Lorentz gas with particle size $r$ obtained by Lutsko and Toth (2020) from $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)|^2 =0$ to $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)| =0$. We show that this is the maximal reachable timescale with the coupling of stochastic processes introduced in the original result. In our improved geometric estimates we make use of the convexity of scatterers to obtain better dispersive estimates for the associated billiard map. We provide additional estimates which potentially open the possibility to reach, with a more elaborate coupling argument, up to timescales just below of $T(r)\sim r^{-2}$ when recollision patterns of arbitrary length occur.</description>

      <title>General theory of perturbation of infinite resistor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice.
  We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance.
  Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously.
  To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented.
  In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations.
  We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to advanced linear algebra, with emphasis on geometric aspects, and with some applications included too. We first review basic linear algebra, notably with the spectral theorem in its general form, and with the theory of the resultant and discriminant. Then we discuss the Jordan form and its basic applications to physics, and other advanced decomposition results for the matrices. We then go into positivity topics, involving matrices and bilinear forms, and with a look into curved space-time, and discrete Laplacians. Finally, we discuss the various groups of matrices, with a look at reflection groups, Lie groups, spin matrices, and random matrices.</description>

      <title>ECLEIRS: Exact conservation law embedded identification of reduced states for parameterized partial differential equations from sparse and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-query applications such as parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification and design optimization for parameterized PDE systems are expensive due to the high computational cost of high-fidelity simulations. Reduced/Latent state dynamics approaches for parameterized PDEs offer a viable method where high-fidelity data and machine learning techniques are used to reduce the system's dimensionality and estimate the dynamics of low-dimensional reduced states. These reduced state dynamics approaches rely on high-quality data and struggle with highly sparse spatiotemporal noisy measurements typically obtained from experiments. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that these models satisfy governing physical conservation laws, especially for parameters that are not a part of the model learning process. In this article, we propose a reduced state dynamics approach, which we refer to as ECLEIRS, that satisfies conservation laws exactly even for parameters unseen in the model training process. ECLEIRS is demonstrated for two applications: 1) obtaining clean solution signals from sparse and noisy measurements of parametric systems, and 2) predicting dynamics for unseen system parameters. We compare ECLEIRS with other reduced state dynamics approaches, those that do not enforce any physical constraints and those with physics-informed loss functions, for three shock-propagation problems: 1-D advection, 1-D Burgers and 2-D Euler equations. The numerical experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that ECLEIRS provides the most accurate prediction of dynamics for unseen parameters even in the presence of highly sparse and noisy data. We also demonstrate that ECLEIRS yields solutions and fluxes that satisfy the governing conservation law up to machine precision for unseen parameters, while the other methods yield much higher errors and do not satisfy conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Laplacian in waveguide shaped surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $-\Delta_{\cal S}$ be the Laplace operator in ${\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ on a waveguide shaped surfaces, i.e., ${\cal S}$ is built by translating a closed curve in a constant direction along an unbounded spatial curve. Under the condition that the tangent vector of the reference curve admits a finite limit at infinity, we find the essential spectrum of $-\Delta_{\cal S}$ and discuss conditions under which discrete eigenvalues emerge. Furthermore, we analyze the Laplacian in the case of a broken sheared waveguide shaped surface.</description>

      <title>CFD Modelling and Sensitivity-Guided Design of Silicon Filament CVD Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament-based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for silicon (Si) coatings is often treated as a straightforward adaptation of planar deposition, just with a cylindrical substrate. But this overlooks a fundamental shift in how transport phenomena and reaction kinetics interact. In filament CVD, the filament is not just a substrate; it is the dominant heat source and flow disruptor all in one. In this work, we ask: What really governs Si film growth on filaments? Using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, we show that filament geometry, thermal gradients, and flow-induced buoyancy do not merely affect uniformity -- they define the very regimes (reaction-limited, transition, diffusion-limited) in which deposition occurs. Our model, validated against three independent experimental studies (R-squared = 0.969), reveals how temperature, flow rate, and reactor layout fundamentally shift the growth dynamics. We show that reducing filament diameter from 2 mm to 500 microns does not just increase local surface area -- it can triple growth rates (up to approximately 39 microns per minute), but only in carefully tuned high-temperature regimes. Similarly, multi-filament setups do not simply scale deposition, they reshape flow fields and compound thermal asymmetries, sometimes improving uniformity, other times worsening it. These effects are not evident without modeling the interplay between transport and kinetics, something experiments alone cannot resolve. To bridge physical understanding with design actionability, we apply global sensitivity analysis via Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Sobol indices. These reveal how in reaction-limited regimes, temperature dominates; in diffusion-limited regimes, reactant transport takes over.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and possibly others with Im (p) &lt; 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially short time scale, our previous results (Kui\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10, 384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymptotics of pseudodifferential operators with discontinuous symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete spectrum of self-adjoint Weyl pseudodifferential operators with discontinuous symbols of the form $1_\Omega \phi$ where $1_\Omega$ is the indicator of a domain in $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$, and $\phi\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb R^2)$ is a real-valued function. It was known that in general, the singular values $s_k$ of such an operator satisfy the bound $s_k = O(k^{-3/4})$, $k = 1, 2, \dots$. We show that if $\Omega$ is a polygon, the singular values decrease as $O(k^{-1}\log k)$. In the case where $\Omega$ is a sector, we obtain an asymptotic formula which confirms the sharpness of the above bound.
  Our main technical tool is the reduction to another symbol that we call \textit{dual}, which is automatically smooth. To analyse the dual symbol we find new bounds for singular values of pseudodifferential operators with smooth symbols in $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$ for arbitrary dimension $d\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures within Schr\"odinger-Dunkl framework in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have presented analytical solution of Schr\"odinger-Dunkl equation with Deng-Fan molecular potential in spherical coordinates. The ro-vibrational energy of some selected diatomic molecules ScH, TiH, VH and CrH are obtained under a simple, new approximation to the centrifugal term in presence of three reflection operators and Dunkl parameters. The angular wave functions are obtained in terms of Jacobi polynomial, whereas radial wave functions in terms of hypergeometric function. The analytical results of Shannon entropy, expectation, Heisenberg uncertainty, entropic moment, disequilibrium, R\'enyi entropy and Tsallis entropy of marginal density (radial r, and angular {\theta}, {\phi}) and total density functions are obtained in Schr\"odinger-Dunkl system with respect to the weighted Lebesgue measure. This has been possible by making use of factorization method for Shannon entropy. The absolute per cent deviation between the analytical and numerical results for all the information theoretic measures remain well within 0.0001%. The effect of reflection operators on angular wave solutions and on information theoretic measures are shown. In essence, a number of statistical measures have been reported for Deng-Fan potential in the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger framework.</description>

      <title>The Dirac--Bergmann approach to optimal control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for optimal control in both classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution dynamically. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: the classical and quantum brachistochrone problems, the latter relevant for quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Finite energy foliations in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about using pseudo-holomorphic curves to study the circular planar restricted three-body problem. The main result states that for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and energies slightly above the first Lagrange value, the flow on the regularized component $\mathbb R P^3 \# \mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface admits a finite energy foliation with three binding orbits, namely two retrograde orbits around the primaries and the Lyapunov orbit in the neck region about the first Lagrange point. This foliation explains the numerically observed homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov orbits. The critical energy surface is proved to satisfy the strict convexity condition in regularizing elliptic coordinates. This allows for the application of a general abstract result for Reeb vector fields on holed lens spaces, concerning the existence of finite energy foliations with prescribed binding orbits. As a by-product of the convex analysis, Birkhoff's retrograde orbit conjecture is proved for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and all energies below the first Lagrange value. This conjecture states that the retrograde orbit bounds a disk-like global surface of section on each regularized component $\mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal Uhlmann-Chern Number: Bridging Pure and Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, Borel-Laplace multitransforms, and quantum differential equations of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration problem for the isomonodromic system of quantum differential equations associated with smooth projective Fano varieties. We begin by introducing a class of multivariable, multivalued analytic functions of Mittag-Leffler type. We study their analytic properties and provide explicit Mellin-Barnes integral representations. For any smooth Fano toric variety, we prove that suitable integral linear combinations of these generalized Mittag-Leffler functions and their derivatives form bases of solutions for the corresponding quantum differential equation. In the second part of the paper, we introduce two families of integral transforms -- referred to as Borel-Laplace multitransforms -- acting on tuples of functions. We show that the Laplace multitransform enables the reconstruction of the full solution space of the quantum differential equations for Fano complete intersections, starting from a basis of solutions associated with the ambient Fano variety. Dually, the Borel multitransform reconstructs the solution space for the quantum differential equations of Fano projective bundles of arbitrary rank from that of the base variety. These results both systematize and generalize the research directions initiated in arXiv:2005.08262 and arXiv:2210.05445. Applications include explicit examples involving Fano toric complete intersections, Fano bundles on toric varieties, and low-dimensional Fano varieties such as strict del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Reducible Iterated Graph Systems: multiscale-freeness and multifractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterated Graph Systems (IGS) aims to transplant ideas from fractal geometry into graph theory. Building on this framework, we extend Edge IGS from the primitive to the reducible setting. Within this broader context, we formulate rigorous definitions of multifractality and multiscale-freeness for graph fractals, and we establish conditions that are equivalent to the occurrence of these two phenomena. We further determine the corresponding fractal and degree spectra, proving that both are finite and discrete. These results complete the foundational theory of Edge IGS by filling the gap left by the primitive case studied in [1,2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-linear electrodynamics (NED) minimally coupled to general relativity. We derive novel electrically charged, spherically symmetric, black-hole solutions having, for some set of parameters, all their NED fields (the electric field and the square of the electromagnetic field) regular for all values of the radial coordinate. For another set of parameters, the NED fields and the Kretschmann scalar are regular as the radial coordinate runs from one spatial infinity to another spatial infinity without the metric being a wormhole. We obtain solutions that have two distinct or the same asymptotic behaviors (two spatial infinities) with equal or unequal ADM masses and solutions with always one horizon whatever the ratio of the electric charge to mass. We comment on some regularity theorems and generalize them to multi-valued NED Lagrangians. The derived regular solutions do not violate the Weak Energy Condition.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of contraction map proof method for holographic entropy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that, generically, the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of trajectories of systems of harmonic oscillators equipped with a point, absolutely continuous or singular measure are considered in this paper. Linear flow of an infinite system of oscillators on an infinite dimensional tori in the phase space are studied. It was shown in [28] that for infinite-dimensional linear flows of a countable system of oscillators there is a new type of trajectories that is not periodic and has no transitive projection on any 4-dimensional symplectic subspace. A trajectory with this property is absent in the finite-dimensional case, it is not typical for a countably system of oscillators and it is typical for a continual one. We show that any point of a non-degenerated invariant torus is non-wandering point of the flow of a countable system of harmonic oscillators. But a point of a non-degenerated invariant torus of a flow of continual system of harmonic oscillator with absolutely continuous measure is wandering point. For the continual system of oscillators with a singular measure we obtain sufficient conditions on measure and torus for absence of transitive trajectory and non-wandering points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend a fractional-dimensional space model for anisotropic solids by incorporating a q-deformed derivative operator, inspired by Tsallis' nonadditive entropy framework. This generalization provides an analytical framework for exploring anisotropic thermal properties, within a unified and flexible mathematical formalism. We derive modified expressions for the phonon density of states and specific heat capacity, highlighting the impact of the deformation parameters on thermodynamic behavior. We apply the model to various solid-state materials, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data, across a wide temperature range and demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing anisotropic and subextensive effects in real systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</description>

Abstract: Quantum measurements are important tools in quantum information, represented by positive, operator-valued measures. A wide class of symmetric measurements is given via generalized equiangular measurements that form conical 2-designs. We show that only two positive constants are needed to fully characterize a variety of important quantum measures constructed from such operators. Examples are given for entropic uncertainty relations, the Brukner-Zeilinger invariants, quantum coherence, quantum concurrence, and the Schmidt-number criterion for entanglement detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theory on tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes based on Kelvin-Helmholtz Theorems. When the pressure difference between the lowest pressure line from the wall cloud down to the ground and its surroundings is large enough, the increase of vorticity inside the squeezed vortex tube can reach the tornado level, and thus a tornado is born. When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases. When the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The decay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our theory of the entire tornado lifespan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genus 2 Macdonald polynomials $\Psi^{(q,t)}_{j_1,j_2,j_3}$ generalize ordinary Macdonald polynomials in several aspects. First, they provide common eigenfunctions for commuting difference operators that generalize the Macdonald difference operators of type $A_1$. Second, the algebra generated by these difference operators together with multiplication operators admits an action of genus 2 mapping class group (MCG) that generalizes the well-known action of $SL(2,{\mathbb Z})$ for ordinary Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, one more important aspect of Macdonald theory is considered: the Cauchy identities. We construct a genus 2 generalization of Cauchy identities in the particular case when $t=q=1$, i.e. for genus 2 Schur polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem for a linearly elastic magnetic material that incorporates elastically rigid magnetic inclusions firmly bonded to the matrix. By considering a periodic arrangement of this material, we identify an effective magnetoelastic energy, obtained by homogenization when the period approaches zero. For comparison, we also briefly discuss alternative, essentially equivalent magnetic models naturally linked by a Legendre-Fenchel transform of magnetic energy density where the elastic deformation enters as a parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the second half of the 19th century Darboux obtained determinant formulae that provide the general solution for a linear hyperbolic second order PDE with finite Laplace series. These formulae played an important role in his study of the theory of surfaces and, in particular, in the theory of conjugate nets. During the last three decades discrete analogs of conjugate nets (Q-nets) were actively studied. Laplace series can be defined also for hyperbolic difference operators. We prove discrete analogs of Darboux formulae for discrete and semi-discrete hyperbolic operators with finite Laplace series.</description>

Abstract: We consider a convective bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions and singular potentials. For this model, well-posedness results concerning weak and strong solutions have already been established in the literature. However, they require the prescribed velocity fields to belong to function spaces with high time regularity. In this paper, we prove that the well-posedness of weak solutions holds true under more general regularity assumptions on the velocity fields. Next, via an alternative proof for higher regularity, we show the well-posedness of strong solutions for velocity fields of Leray type, which is a more relevant assumption for physical applications. Our approach hinges upon a new well-posedness and regularity theory for a bulk-surface elliptic system with singular nonlinearities, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A direct method in noncommutative integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a constructive framework for deriving noncommutative (NC) integrable equations directly from quasi-determinant solutions. Building upon the quasi-Wronskian structure, we extend the classical direct method to the NC setting, where standard determinant identities are replaced by algebraic relations intrinsic to quasi-determinants. By analyzing derivative identities satisfied by quasi-determinants, we recover the NC Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (ncKP) and Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa (ncDJKM) equations by cancellations of nonlinear terms. Furthermore, by imposing flow constraints on the seed functions, we derive NC reductions such as the ncKdV and ncBoussinesq equations and obtain explicit matrix-valued soliton solutions. Our results highlight the quasi-determinant as a fundamental algebraic structure underpinning NC $\tau$-function structure.</description>

      <title>Spin Chain Integrability as a Supersymmetric Gauge Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel correspondence between 4D $\mathcal N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $D^2\times T^2$ and open XYZ spin chains with generalized boundary conditions, extending beyond previous 3D Bethe/gauge duality frameworks. Our primary contribution is the rigorous construction of the first exact duality between 4D BCD-type gauge theories and general-boundary XYZ spin chains governed by elliptic $R$-matrices. This framework provides a universal mechanism for resolving supersymmetric gauge theory/spin-chain duality across dimensional hierarchies: 2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XXX spin chain, 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XXZ spin chain, 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ $\longleftrightarrow$ XYZ spin chain, mediated through the $\Omega$-deformation parameter $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of Gaussian and Laguerre Ensembles at the Soft Edge III: Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conclude our work [arXiv:2403.07628, arXiv:2503.12644] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles, now studying the gap-probability generating functions. We show that the correction terms in the asymptotic expansion are multilinear forms of the higher-order derivatives of the leading-order term, with certain rational polynomial coefficients that are independent of the dummy variable. In this way, the same multilinear structure, with the same polynomial coefficients, is inherited by the asymptotic expansion of any linearly induced quantity such as the distribution of the $k$-th largest level. Whereas the results for the unitary ensembles are presented with proof, the discussion of the orthogonal and symplectic ones is based on some hypotheses. To substantiate the hypotheses, we check the result for the $k$-th largest level in the orthogonal ensembles against simulation data for choices of $n$ and $k$ that require as many as four correction terms to achieve satisfactory accuracy.</description>

      <title>Disordered harmonic chain with random masses and springs: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study harmonic chains with i.i.d. random spring constants $K_n$ and i.i.d. random masses $m_n$. We introduce a new combinatorial approach which allows to derive a compact approximate expression for the complex Lyapunov exponent, in terms of the solutions of two transcendental equations involving the distributions of the spring constants and the masses. Our result makes easy the asymptotic analysis of the low frequency properties of the eigenmodes (spectral density and localization) for arbitrary disorder distribution, as well as their high frequency properties. We apply the method to the case of power-law distributions $p(K)=\mu\,K^{-1+\mu}$ with $0&lt;K&lt;1$ and $q(m)=\nu\,m^{-1-\nu}$ with $m&gt;1$ (with $\mu,\:\nu&gt;0$). At low frequency, the spectral density presents the power law $\varrho(\omega\to0)\sim\omega^{2\eta-1}$, where the exponent $\eta$ exhibits first order phase transitions on the line $\mu=1$ and on the line $\nu=1$. The exponent of the non disordered chain ($\eta=1/2$) is recovered when $\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n\rangle$ are both finite, i.e. $\mu&gt;1$ and $\nu&gt;1$. The Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length) shows also a power-law behaviour $\gamma(\omega^2\to0)\sim\omega^{2\zeta}$, where the exponent $\zeta$ exhibits several phase transitions~: the exponent is $\zeta=\eta$ for $\mu&lt;1$ or $\nu&lt;1$ ($\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ or $\langle m_n\rangle$ infinite) and $\zeta=1$ when $\mu&gt;2$ and $\nu&gt;2$ ($\langle K_n^{-2}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n^2\rangle$ both finite). In the intermediate region it is given by $\zeta=\mathrm{min}(\mu,\nu)/2$. On the transition lines, $\varrho(\omega)$ and $\gamma(\omega^2)$ receive logarithmic corrections. Finally, we also consider the Anderson model with random couplings (random spring chain for ``Dyson type I'' disorder).</description>

      <title>Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.</description>

      <title>First Exit Times of Harmonically Trapped Particles: A Didactic Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:1411.3598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revise the classical problem of characterizing first exit times of a harmonically trapped particle whose motion is described by one- or multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion. Some extensions are described, including diffusion under quadratic double-well potential and anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <title>Colored Interacting Particle Systems on the Ring: Stationary Measures from Yang-Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting particle systems, motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials).
  In this paper, we present a unified approach to constructing stationary measures for most of the known colored particle systems on the ring and the line, including (1) the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (multispecies ASEP, or mASEP); (2) the q-deformed Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) also known as the q-Boson particle system; (3) the q-deformed Pushing Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (q-PushTASEP). Our method is based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang-Baxter equation. We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new "queue vertex models" on the cylinder. The stationarity property is a direct consequence of the Yang-Baxter equation.
  For the mASEP on the ring, a particular case of our vertex model is equivalent to the multiline queues of Martin (arXiv:1810.10650). For the colored q-Boson process and the q-PushTASEP on the ring, we recover and generalize known stationary measures constructed using multiline queues or other methods by Ayyer-Mandelshtam-Martin (arXiv:2011.06117, arXiv:2209.09859), and Bukh-Cox (arXiv:1912.03510). Our proofs of stationarity use the Yang-Baxter equation and bypass the Matrix Product Ansatz used for the mASEP by Prolhac-Evans-Mallick (arXiv:0812.3293).
  On the line and in a quadrant, we use the Yang-Baxter equation to establish a general colored Burke's theorem, which implies that suitable specializations of our queue vertex models produce stationary measures for particle systems on the line. We also compute the colored particle currents in stationarity.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <title>Examples of small-time controllable Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain control in small times.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetry of Odd Leech Lattice CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Mathieu groups $M_{24}$ and $M_{23}$ in the isometry group of the odd Leech lattice do not lift to subgroups of the automorphism group of its lattice vertex operator (super)algebra. In other words, the subgroups $2^{24}.M_{24}$ and $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra are non-split extensions. Our method can also confirm a similar result for the Conway group $\mathrm{Co}_0$ and the Leech lattice, which was already shown in [Griess 1973]. This study is motivated by the moonshine-type observation on the $\mathcal{N}=2$ extremal elliptic genus of central charge 24 by [Benjamin, Dyer, Fitzpatrick, Kachru arXiv:1507.00004]. We also investigate weight-1 and weight-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents invariant under the subgroup $2^{24}.M_{24}$ or $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra, and revisit an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra in it.</description>

      <title>Fisher Information in Kinetic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00925v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is presented for linear, local, short-wavelength instabilities in swirling flows, in which axial shear, differential rotation, radial thermal stratification, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are all taken into account. A geometrical optics approach is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation, leading to a set of amplitude transport equations. From these, a dispersion relation is derived, capturing two distinct types of instability: a stationary centrifugal instability and an oscillatory, visco-diffusive McIntyre instability. Instability regions corresponding to different axial or azimuthal wavenumbers are found to possess envelopes in the plane of physical parameters, which are explicitly determined using the discriminants of polynomials. As these envelopes are shown to bound the union of instability regions associated with particular wavenumbers, it is concluded that the envelopes correspond to curves of critical values of physical parameters, thereby providing compact, closed-form criteria for the onset of instability. The derived analytical criteria are validated for swirling flows modelled by a cylindrical, differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria unify and extend, to viscous and thermodiffusive differentially heated swirling flows, the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling, differentially heated, visco-diffusive flows, thereby generalising the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every twist of pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group GL(N) can be realized as an open-string field theory in topological string theory. Our approach reinterprets twists of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as generalized Chern-Simons theories, and identifies topological string backgrounds that produce the corresponding Chern-Simons theories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$ of a finite dimensional C*-algebra $B$ and its Plancherel trace. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

Abstract: We show that ultra-massive spacetimes exist also in 2 + 1 dimensions with a positive cosmological constant {\Lambda} &gt; 0. They can be created through the collapse of a spherical null dust shell. The exterior of the shell is then a Mess spacetime, that is to say a locally de Sitter spacetime that cannot be obtained as a quotient of de Sitter space.</description>

Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x;\tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 +\tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R},$$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. It is known that the recurrence coefficients $\beta_n$ satisfy a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation, which is a special case of the second member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy, often known as the ''string equation''. The recurrence coefficients have been studied in the context of Hermitian one-matrix models and random symmetric matrix ensembles with researchers in the 1990s observing ''chaotic, pseudo-oscillatory'' behaviour. More recently, this ''chaotic phase'' was described as a dispersive shockwave in a hydrodynamic chain. Our emphasis is a comprehensive study of the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as the parameters $\tau$ and $t$ vary. Extensive computational analysis is carried out, using Maple, for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions and modified Bessel functions. The results highlight the rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Due to their high sensitivity, Fourier-type wavefront sensors (WFSs) are the sensors of choice for many current and upcoming AO systems in ophthalmic imaging, free-space optical communications (FSOC) and astronomical ground-based telescopes such as the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fourier-type WFSs. However, their non-linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed. They are expected to occur during strong atmospheric turbulence conditions, which are commonplace for non-rural sites and daytime observations.
  This study presents a novel type of iterative reconstructor to overcome non-linear wavefront sensing regimes. The underlying method is the non-linear Landweber iteration with Nesterov acceleration, well known in the field of inverse problems. A significant advantage of the new approach is its direct applicability to any Fourier-type WFS. This is implemented by adapting the filtering mask of the specific Fourier-type WFSs in the model-based algorithm.
  Several Fourier-type wavefront sensors are considered for ELT-scale instruments and their performance with the new algorithm is compared. The study goes on to concentrate on the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), one of the most well-known Fourier-type WFSs. We demonstrate in end-to-end simulations that this novel approach outperforms linear methods in non-linear sensing regimes.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of random band matrices at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: specifically, $S_{xy}=0$ whenever the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. We further establish quantum unique ergodicity for delocalized eigenvectors, as well as a rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, including the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <title>On braided Hopf structures on exterior algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the exterior algebra of a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than one admits a one-parameter family of braided Hopf algebra structures, arising from its identification with a Nichols algebra. We explicitly compute the structure constants with respect to a natural set-theoretic basis.
  A one-parameter family of diagonal automorphisms exists, which we use to construct solutions to the (constant) Yang--Baxter equation. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$. We support this conjecture through computations for small values of $N$.</description>

      <title>A geometric approximation of non-local interface and boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze an approximation of a Laplacian subject to non-local interface conditions of a $\delta'$-type by Neumann Laplacians on a family of Riemannian manifolds with a sieve-like structure. We establish a (kind of) resolvent convergence for such operators, which in turn implies the convergence of spectra and eigenspaces, and demonstrate convergence of the corresponding semigroups. Moreover, we provide an explicit example of a manifold allowing to realize any prescribed integral kernel appearing in that interface conditions. Finally, we extend the discussion to similar approximations for the Laplacian with non-local Robin-type boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</description>
