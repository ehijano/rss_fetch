      <title>Generalized Fractional Risk Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a compound generalized fractional counting process (CGFCP) which is a generalization of the compound versions of several well-known fractional counting processes. We obtain its mean, variance, and the fractional differential equation governing the probability law. Motivated by Kumar et al. (2020), we introduce a fractional risk process by considering CGFCP as the surplus process and call it generalized fractional risk process (GFRP). We study the martingale property of the GFRP and show that GFRP and the associated increment process exhibit the long-range dependence (LRD) and the short-range dependence (SRD) property, respectively. We also define an alternative to GFRP, namely AGFRP which is premium wise different from the GFRP. Finally, the asymptotic structure of the ruin probability for the AGFRP is established in case of light-tailed and heavy-tailed claim sizes.</description>

      <title>Darboux transformation of diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darboux transformation of a second order linear differential operator is a well-known technique with many applications in mathematics and physics. We study Darboux transformation from the point of view of Markov semigroups of diffusion processes. We construct a Darboux transform of a diffusion process through a combination of Doob's $h$-transform and a version of Siegmund duality. Our main result is a simple formula that connects transition probability densities of the two processes. We provide several examples of Darboux transformed diffusion processes related to Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For these examples we compute explicitly the transition probability density and derive its spectral representation.</description>

      <title>On the limit distribution of extremes of generalized Oppenheim random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the extremes of a sequence of generalized Oppenheim random variables. Particularly, we establish conditions under which some normalized extremes of sequences arising from Oppenheim expansions belong to the maximum domain of attraction of the Frechet distribution. Additionally, we identify conditions under which the maxima and minima of Oppenheim random variables demonstrate some kind of asymptotic independence. Finally, we prove an Extreme Types theorem for Oppenheim expansions with unknown dependent structure.</description>

      <title>Spatial asymptotic behaviors of fractional stochastic heat equations driven by additive L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish explicit integral tests for spatial asymptotic behaviors of fractional stochastic heat equations driven by additive L\'evy white noise. Our results indicate that fractional stochastic heat equations enjoy the so-called additive physical intermittent property in all dimensions when the driven L\'evy white noise is sufficiently light-tailed. The proofs are based on heat kernel estimates for the fractional Laplacian and exact tail behaviors for Poissonian functionals associated with the driven L\'evy white noise.</description>

      <title>Multi-indices coproducts from ODEs to singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>Time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups and cokernels of random integer block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups in the case where each random walk step need not be supported on a generating set of the group. When the supports of the random walk steps satisfy a natural condition involving normal subgroups of quotients of the group, we show that the random walk converges to the uniform distribution on the group and give bounds for the convergence rate using spectral properties of the random walk steps. As an application, we prove a universality theorem for cokernels of random integer matrices allowing some dependence between entries.</description>

      <title>Breuer-Major Theorems for Hilbert Space-Valued Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{X_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be a stationary Gaussian process with values in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$, and let $G:\mathcal{H}_1 \to \mathcal{H}_2$ be an operator acting on $X_k$. Under suitable conditions on the operator $G$ and the temporal and cross-sectional correlations of $\{X_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$, we derive a central limit theorem (CLT) for the normalized partial sums of $\{G[X_k]\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$. To prove a CLT for the Hilbert space-valued process $\{G[X_k]\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$, we employ techniques from the recently developed infinite dimensional Malliavin-Stein framework. In addition, we provide quantitative and continuous time versions of the derived CLT. In a series of examples, we recover and strengthen limit theorems for a wide array of statistics relevant in functional data analysis, and present a novel limit theorem in the framework of neural operators as an application of our result.</description>

      <title>On some open problems in reliability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic scheduling on an unreliable machine with general up-times and general set-up times which is described by a group of partial differential equations with Dirac-delta functions in the boundary and initial conditions. In special case that the random processing rate of job $i,$ the random up-time rate of job $i$ and the random repair rate of job $i$ are constants, we determine the explicit expression of its time-dependent solution and give the asymptotic behavior of its time-dependent solution. Our result implies that $C_0-$semigroup theory is not suitable for this model. In general case, we determine the Laplace transform of its time-dependent solution. Next, we convert the model into an abstract Cauchy problem whose underlying operator is an evolution family. Finally, we leave some open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a last progeny modified branching random walk, in which the position of each particle at the last generation $n$ is modified by an i.i.d. copy of a random variable $Y$. Depending on the asymptotic properties of the tail of $Y$, we describe the asymptotic behaviour of the extremal process of this model as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Random walk on sphere packings and Delaunay triangulations in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a transient random walk in Dirichlet environment, or equivalently a linearly edge reinforced random walk, on a Galton-Watson tree. We compute the stationary distribution of the environment seen from the particle of an edge reinforced random walk. We obtain a formula for the speed and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the walk to have a positive speed under some moment conditions on the offspring distribution of the tree.</description>

      <title>Lower classes and Chung's LILs of the fractional integrated generalized fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{X(t)\}_{t\geqslant0}$ be the generalized fractional Brownian motion introduced by Pang and Taqqu (2019):
  \begin{align*}
  \{X(t)\}_{t\ge0}\overset{d}{=}&amp;\left\{ \int_{\mathbb R} \left((t-u)_+^{\alpha}-(-u)_+^{\alpha} \right) |u|^{-\gamma/2}
  B(du) \right\}_{t\ge0},
  \end{align*} where $ \gamma\in [0,1), \ \ \alpha\in \left(-\frac12+\frac{\gamma}{2}, \ \frac12+\frac{\gamma}{2} \right)$ are constants. For any $\theta&gt;0$, let \begin{align*}
  Y(t)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\theta)}\int_0^t (t-u)^{\theta-1} X(u)du, \quad t\ge 0. \end{align*} Building upon the arguments of Talagrand (1996), we give integral criteria for the lower classes of $Y$ at $t=0$ and at infinity, respectively. As a consequence, we derive its Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm. In the proofs, the small ball probability estimates play important roles.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations (SRDAEs) with spatially homogeneous colored noises and variable-order nonlocal operators in mixed norm $L_q(L_p)$-spaces. We introduce a new condition (strongly reinforced Dalang's condition) on colored noise, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the complicated relation between nonlinearities and stochastic forces. Additionally, we establish the space-time H\"older type regularity of solutions.</description>

      <title>Pointwise well-posedness results for degenerate It\^{o}-SDEs with locally bounded drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on results developed in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14902, where It\^{o}-SDEs with possibly degenerate and discontinuous dispersion coefficient and measurable drift were analyzed with respect to a given (sub-)invariant measure, we develop here additional elliptic regularity results for PDEs and consider the same equations with some further regularity assumptions on the coefficients to provide a pointwise analysis for every starting point in Euclidean space, $d\ge 2$. Our main result is (weak) well-posedness, i.e. weak existence and uniqueness in law, which we obtain under our main assumption for any locally bounded drift and arbitrary starting point among all solutions that spend zero time at the points of degeneracy of the dispersion coefficient. The points of degeneracy form a $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero set, but may be hit by the weak solutions. Weak existence for arbitrary starting point is obtained under broader assumptions. In particular, in that case the drift does not need to be locally bounded.</description>

      <title>Optimal Eigenvalue Rigidity of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the normalized adjacency matrices of random $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices with fixed degree $d\geq 3$, and denote the eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We prove that the optimal (up to an extra $N^{{\rm o}_N(1)}$ factor, where ${\rm o}_N(1)$ can be arbitrarily small) eigenvalue rigidity holds. More precisely, denote $\gamma_i$ as the classical location of the $i$-th eigenvalue under the Kesten-Mckay law in decreasing order. Then with probability $1-N^{-1+{\rm o}_N(1)}$,
  \begin{align*}
  |\lambda_i-\gamma_i|\leq \frac{N^{{\rm o}_N(1)}}{N^{2/3} (\min\{i,N-i+1\})^{1/3}},\quad \text{ for all } i\in \{2,3,\cdots,N\}.
  \end{align*}
  In particular, the fluctuations of extreme eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}_N(1)}$. This gives the same order of fluctuation as for the eigenvalues of matrices from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble.</description>

      <title>Regularization by rough Kraichnan noise for the generalised SQG equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalised Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (gSQG) equations in $\mathbb R^2$ with parameter $\beta\in (0,1)$, an active scalar model interpolating between SQG ($\beta=1$) and the 2D Euler equations ($\beta=0$) in vorticity form. Existence of weak $(L^1\cap L^p)$-valued solutions in the deterministic setting is known, but their uniqueness is open. We show that the addition of a rough Stratonovich transport noise of Kraichnan type regularizes the PDE, providing strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for initial data $\theta_0\in L^1\cap L^p$, for suitable values $p\in[2,\infty]$ related to the regularity degree $\alpha$ of the noise and the singularity degree $\beta$ of the velocity field; in particular, we can cover any $\beta\in (0,1)$ for suitable $\alpha$ and $p$ and we can reach a suitable ("critical") threshold. The result also holds in the presence of external forcing $f\in L^1_t (L^1\cap L^p)$ and solutions are shown to depend continuously on the data of the problem; furthermore, they are well approximated by vanishing viscosity and regular approximations.</description>

      <title>Bond percolation games on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, and ergodicity of associated probabilistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation games on the $2$-dimensional square lattice in which each edge (that is either between the sites $(x,y)$ and $(x+1,y)$ or between the sites $(x,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$, for all $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$) has been assigned, independently, a label that reads "trap" with probability $p$, "target" with probability $q$, and "open" with probability $1-p-q$. Once a realization of this labeling is generated, it is revealed in its entirety to the players before the game starts. The game involves a single token, initially placed at the origin, and two players who take turns to make moves. A move involves relocating the token from where it is currently located, say the site $(x,y)$, to any one of $(x+1,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$. A player wins if she is able to move the token along an edge labeled a target, or if she is able to force her opponent to move the token along an edge labeled a trap. The game is said to result in a draw if it continues indefinitely (i.e.\ with the token always being moved along open edges). We ask the question: for what values of $p$ and $q$ is the probability of draw equal to $0$? By establishing a close connection between the event of draw and the ergodicity of a suitably defined probabilistic cellualar automaton, we are able to show that the probability of draw is $0$ when $p &gt; 0.157175$ and $q=0$, and when $p=q \geqslant 0.10883$.</description>

      <title>Optimal tail estimates in $\beta$-ensembles and applications to last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermite and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are important and well studied models in random matrix theory with special cases $\beta=1,2,4$ corresponding to eigenvalues of classical random matrix ensembles. It is well known that the largest eigenvalues in these, under appropriate scaling, converge weakly to the Tracy-Widom $\beta$ distribution whose distribution function $F_{\beta}$ has asymptotics given by $1-F_{\beta}(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{2\beta}{3}(1+o(1))x^{3/2}\right)$ as $x\to \infty$ and $F_{\beta}(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{24}(1+o(1))|x|^3\right)$ as $x\to -\infty$. Although tail estimates for the largest eigenvalues with correct exponents have been proved for the pre-limiting models, estimates with matching constants had not so far been established for general $\beta$; even in the exactly solvable cases, some of the bounds were missing. In this paper, we prove upper and lower moderate deviation estimates for both tails with matching constants.
  We illustrate the usefulness of these estimates by considering certain questions in planar exponential last passage percolation (LPP), a well-studied model in the KPZ universality class in which certain statistics have same distributions as largest eigenvalues in Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles (for $\beta=1,2,4$). Using our estimates in conjunction with a combination of old and new results on the LPP geometry, we obtain three laws of iterated logarithm including one which settles a conjecture of Ledoux (J. Theor. Probab., 2018). We expect that the sharp moderate deviation estimates will find many further applications in LPP problems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo Using Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an efficient approach for accelerating multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for large-scale problems using low-fidelity machine learning models. While conventional techniques for large-scale Bayesian inference often substitute computationally expensive high-fidelity models with machine learning models, thereby introducing approximation errors, our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative by augmenting high-fidelity models with low-fidelity ones within a hierarchical framework. The multilevel approach utilizes the low-fidelity machine learning model (MLM) for inexpensive evaluation of proposed samples thereby improving the acceptance of samples by the high-fidelity model. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is derived from geometric multigrid hierarchy. We utilize an MLM to acclerate the coarse level sampling. Training machine learning model for the coarsest level significantly reduces the computational cost associated with generating training data and training the model. We present an MCMC algorithm to accelerate the coarsest level sampling using MLM and account for the approximation error introduced. We provide theoretical proofs of detailed balance and demonstrate that our multilevel approach constitutes a consistent MCMC algorithm. Additionally, we derive conditions on the accuracy of the machine learning model to facilitate more efficient hierarchical sampling. Our technique is demonstrated on a standard benchmark inference problem in groundwater flow, where we estimate the probability density of a quantity of interest using a four-level MCMC algorithm. Our proposed algorithm accelerates multilevel sampling by a factor of two while achieving similar accuracy compared to sampling using the standard multilevel algorithm.</description>

      <title>Uniform Ergodicity of Parallel Tempering With Efficient Local Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reversible parallel tempering (NRPT) is an effective algorithm for sampling from target distributions with complex geometry, such as those arising from posterior distributions of weakly identifiable and high-dimensional Bayesian models. In this work we establish the uniform (geometric) ergodicity of NRPT under a model of efficient local exploration. The uniform ergodicity log rates are inversely proportional to an easily-estimable divergence, the global communication barrier (GCB), which was recently introduced in the literature. We obtain analogous ergodicity results for classical reversible parallel tempering, providing new evidence that NRPT dominates its reversible counterpart. Our results are based on an analysis of the hitting time of a continuous-time persistent random walk, which is also of independent interest. The rates that we obtain reflect real experiments well for distributions where global exploration is not possible without parallel tempering.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=\frac{|a\Delta b|}{|a\cup b|}$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$.</description>

      <title>Tighter Bounds on the Expected Absorbing Time of Ungarian Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Defant and Li defined the Ungarian Markov chain associated to a lattice $L$. This Markov chain has state space $L$, and from any state $x \in L$ transitions to the meet of $\{x\} \cup T$, where $T$ is a randomly selected subset of the elements of $L$ covered by $x$. They defined $\mathcal{E}(L)$ to be the expected number of steps until the maximal element $\hat{1}$ of $L$ transitions into the minimal element $\hat{0}$ in the Ungarian Markov chain, and investigated its asymptotics when $L$ is the weak order on $S_n$, or the $n$th Tamari lattice $\textrm{Tam}_n$. This paper resolves a conjecture of Defant and Li and makes partial progress towards another, by proving that $\mathcal{E}(S_n)$ is linear in $n$, and proving an $n^{1 - o(1)}$ lower bound on $\mathcal{E}(\textrm{Tam}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Response time in a pair of processor sharing queues with Join-the-Shortest-Queue scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) is the scheduling policy of choice for many network providers, cloud servers and traffic management systems, where individual queues are served under processor sharing (PS) queueing discipline. A numerical solution for the response time distribution in two parallel PS queues with JSQ scheduling is derived for the first time. Using the generating function method, two partial differential equations (PDEs) are obtained corresponding to conditional response times, where the conditioning is on a particular traced task joining the first or the second queue. These PDEs are functional equations that contain partial generating functions and their partial derivatives, and therefore cannot be solved by commonly used techniques. We are able to solve these PDEs numerically with good accuracy and perform the deconditioning with respect to the queue-length probabilities by evaluating a certain complex integral. Numerical results for the density and the first four moments compare well against regenerative simulation with 500,000 regeneration cycles.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Gaussian free field sign clusters and random interlacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.05970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a large class of amenable transient weighted graphs $G$, we prove that the sign clusters of the Gaussian free field on $G$ fall into a regime of strong supercriticality, in which two infinite sign clusters dominate (one for each sign), and finite sign clusters are necessarily tiny, with overwhelming probability. Examples of graphs belonging to this class include regular lattices like $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geqslant 3$, but also more intricate geometries, such as Cayley graphs of suitably growing (finitely generated) non-Abelian groups, and cases in which random walks exhibit anomalous diffusive behavior, for instance various fractal graphs. As a consequence, we also show that the vacant set of random interlacements on these objects, introduced by Sznitman in arXiv:0704.2560, and which is intimately linked to the free field, contains an infinite connected component at small intensities. In particular, this result settles an open problem from arXiv:1010.1490.</description>

Abstract: A version of the classical Buffon problem in the plane naturally extends to the setting of any Riemannian surface with constant Gaussian curvature. The Buffon probability determines a Buffon deficit. The relationship between Gaussian curvature and the Buffon deficit is similar to the relationship that the Bertrand-Diguet-Puiseux Theorem establishes between Gaussian curvature and both circumference and area deficits.</description>

Abstract: We study the numerical evaluation of several functions appearing in the small time expansion of the distribution of the time-integral of the geometric Brownian motion as well as its joint distribution with the terminal value of the underlying Brownian motion. A precise evaluation of these distributions is relevant for the simulation of stochastic volatility models with log-normally distributed volatility, and Asian option pricing in the Black-Scholes model. We derive series expansions for these distributions, which can be used for numerical evaluations. Using tools from complex analysis, we determine the convergence radius and large order asymptotics of the coefficients in these expansions. We construct an efficient numerical approximation of the joint distribution of the time-integral of the gBM and its terminal value, and illustrate its application to Asian option pricing in the Black-Scholes model.</description>

Abstract: For random systems of $K$ polynomials in $N + 1$ real variables which include the models of Kostlan (1987) and Shub and Smale (1993), we prove that the number of zeros on the unit sphere for $K = N$ or the Hausdorff measure of the zero set for $K &lt; N$ concentrates around its mean as $N\to\infty$. To prove concentration we show that the variance of the latter random variable normalized by its mean goes to zero. The polynomial systems we consider depend on a set of parameters which determine the variance of their Gaussian coefficients. We prove that the convergence is uniform in those parameters and $K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bialgebra is a module over a ring that is both an associative algebra and a co-associative coalgebra with the product and coproduct additionally satisfying an appropriate commutative relationship.
  One application of Bialgebras is in the study of Taylor expansions where the product describes how for any increment, two terms of the Taylor expansion can be combined together to obtain a higher order term, while the coproduct describes how a term can be decomposed into lower order terms over two adjacent increments.
  Our motivation is the study of higher order Lions-Taylor expansions and more generally to probabilistic rough paths. The application of iterative Lions derivatives generates a collection of free variables. When terms from a Lions-Taylor expansion are themselves Lions-Taylor expanded, each of these free variables are viewed as tagged and so need Taylor expanding on which greatly increases the number of variables that one needs to keep track of. This additional structure typically takes the form of couplings between terms that arise through the application of the coproduct.
  The purpose of this work is to document the combinatorial properties of Lions forests (which are central to many key interpretations of probabilistic rough paths) and more formally describe the coupled Bialgebra structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in semiconductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume a homogeneous distribution of the trapping centers in the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates, which are sampled from a uniform distribution. We show that the uniform detrapping rate distribution is a natural consequence of the vacant trap depths following the Boltzmann distribution, and the detrapping process obeying Arrhenius law. If the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter, $\alpha_{H}$, is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate. The proposed model implies that $1/f$ noise arises from the temporal charge carrier number fluctuations, not from the spatial mobility fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Improved error estimates for the order of convergence of the Euler method for random ordinary differential equations driven by semi-martingale noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15418v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Euler method for approximating the solutions of a random ordinary differential equation (RODE) $\mathrm{d}X_t/\mathrm{d}t = f(t, X_t, Y_t)$ driven by a stochastic process $\{Y_t\}_t$ with $\theta$-H\"older sample paths is estimated to be of strong order $\theta$ with respect to the time step, provided $f=f(t, x, y)$ is sufficiently regular and with suitable bounds. This order was known to increase to $1$ in some special cases, such as that of an It\^o diffusion noise, in which case the Euler for RODE can be seen as a particular case of the Milstein method for an associated augmented system of stochastic differential equations. Here, it is proved that, in many more typical cases, further structures on the noise can be exploited so that the strong convergence is of order 1. More precisely, we prove so for any semi-martingale noise. This includes It\^o diffusion processes, point-process noises, transport-type processes with sample paths of bounded variation, and time-changed Brownian motion. This also yields a direct proof of order 1 convergence for It\^o process noises. The result follows from estimating the global error as an iterated integral over both large and small mesh scales, and then by switching the order of integration to move the critical regularity to the large scale. The work is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the strong order 1 convergence in those cases, and with an example with fractional Brownian motion noise with Hurst parameter $0 &lt; H &lt; 1/2$ for which the order of convergence is $H + 1/2$, hence lower than the attained order 1 in the semi-martingale examples above, but still higher than the order $H$ of convergence expected from previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of Multiplicative Poisson Equation (MPE) bounded solution existence in the generic discrete-time setting. Assuming mixing and boundedness of the risk-reward function, we investigate what conditions should be imposed on the underlying non-controlled probability kernel or the reward function in order for the MPE bounded solution to always exists. In particular, we consolidate span-norm framework based results and derive an explicit sharp bound that needs to be imposed on the cost function to guarantee the bounded solution existence under mixing. Also, we study the properties which the probability kernel must satisfy to ensure existence of bounded MPE for any generic risk-reward function and characterise process behaviour in the complement of the invariant measure support. Finally, we present numerous examples and stochastic-dominance based arguments that help to better understand the intricacies that emerge when the ergodic risk-neutral mean operator is replaced with ergodic risk-sensitive entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the long time statistics of a one-dimensional stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation with cubic nonlinearity while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we find that the dynamics is attractive toward the unique invariant probability measure with a polynomial rate that is independent of the vanishing viscosity. This relies on a coupling technique exploiting a Foias-Prodi argument specifically tailored to the system. Then, in the inviscid regime, we show that the sequence of invariant measures converges toward the invariant measure of the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation in a suitable Wasserstein distance. Together with the uniform polynomial mixing, we obtain the validity of the inviscid limit for the solutions on the infinite time horizon with a log log rate.</description>

      <title>A $\Gamma$-convergence of level-two large deviation for metastable systems: The case of zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the precise asymptotics of the level-two large deviation rate function and the behavior of metastable stochastic systems. Initially identified for overdamped Langevin dynamics (Ges{\`u} et al., SIAM J Math Anal 49(4), 3048-3072, 2017), this connection has been validated across various models, including random walks in a potential field. We extend this connection to condensing zero-range processes, a complex interacting particle system.
  Specifically, we investigate a certain class of zero-range processes on a fixed graph $G$ with $N &gt; 0$ particles and interaction parameter $\alpha &gt; 1$. On the time scale $N^2$, this process behaves like an absorbing-type diffusion and converges to a condensed state where all particles occupy a single vertex of $G$ as $N$ approaches infinity. Once condensed, on the time scale $N^{1+\alpha}$, the condensed site moves according to a Markov chain on $G$, showing metastable behavior among condensed states. The time scales $N^2$ and $N^{1+\alpha}$ are called the pre-metastable and metastable time scales. It is conjectured that this behavior is encapsulated in the level-two large deviation rate function $\mathcal{I}_N$ of the zero-range process. Specifically, it is expected that the $\Gamma$-expansion of $\mathcal{I}_N$ can be expressed as:$$\mathcal{I}_N = \frac{1}{N^2} \mathcal{K} + \frac{1}{N^{1+\alpha}} \mathcal{J},$$ where $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are the level-two large deviation rate functions of the absorbing diffusion processes and the Markov chain on $G$. We rigorously prove this $\Gamma$-expansion by developing a methodology for $\Gamma$-convergence in the pre-metastable time scale and establishing a link between the resolvent approach to metastability (Landim et al., J Eur Math Soc, 2023. arXiv:2102.00998) and the $\Gamma$-expansion in the metastable time scale.</description>

      <title>Algebraic groups in non-commutative probability theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of coalgebras as well as algebraic groups in non-commutative probability has long been advocated by the school of von Waldenfels and Sch\"urmann. Another algebraic approach was introduced more recently, based on shuffle and pre-Lie calculus, and results in another construction of groups of characters encoding the behaviour of states. Comparing the two, the first approach, recast recently in a general categorical language by Manzel and Sch\"urmann, can be seen as largely driven by the theory of universal products, whereas the second construction builds on Hopf algebras and a suitable algebraization of the combinatorics of noncrossing set partitions. Although both address the same phenomena, moving between the two viewpoints is not obvious. We present here an attempt to unify the two approaches by making explicit the Hopf algebraic connections between them. Our presentation, although relying largely on classical ideas as well as results closely related to Manzel and Sch\"urmann's aforementioned work, is nevertheless original on several points and fills a gap in the non-commutative probability literature. In particular, we systematically use the language and techniques of algebraic groups together with shuffle group techniques to prove that two notions of algebraic groups naturally associated with free, respectively Boolean and monotone, probability theories identify. We also obtain explicit formulas for various Hopf algebraic structures and detail arguments that had been left implicit in the literature.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver for Learning PDEs via Probabilistic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines. The source code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/optray/MCNP.</description>

Abstract: We show that discrete stationary random subgroups of isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces have full limit sets as well as critical exponents bounded from below. This information is used to answer a question of Gelander and show that a rank one locally symmetric space for which the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the same as that of its universal cover has unbounded injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Stability and statistical inference for semidiscrete optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical inference for the optimal transport (OT) map (also known as the Brenier map) from a known absolutely continuous reference distribution onto an unknown finitely discrete target distribution. We derive limit distributions for the $L^p$-error with arbitrary $p \in [1,\infty)$ and for linear functionals of the empirical OT map, together with their moment convergence. The former has a non-Gaussian limit, whose explicit density is derived, while the latter attains asymptotic normality. For both cases, we also establish consistency of the nonparametric bootstrap. The derivation of our limit theorems relies on new stability estimates of functionals of the OT map with respect to the dual potential vector, which may be of independent interest. We also discuss applications of our limit theorems to the construction of confidence sets for the OT map and inference for a maximum tail correlation. Finally, we show that, while the empirical OT map does not possess nontrivial weak limits in the $L^2$ space, it satisfies a central limit theorem in a dual H\"{o}lder space, and the Gaussian limit law attains the asymptotic efficiency bound.</description>

      <title>Computation of random time-shift distributions for stochastic population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even in large systems, the effect of noise arising from when populations are initially small can persist to be measurable on the macroscale. A deterministic approximation to a stochastic model will fail to capture this effect, but it can be accurately approximated by including an additional random time-shift to the initial conditions. We present a efficient numerical method to compute this time-shift distribution for a large class of stochastic models. The method relies on differentiation of certain functional equations, which we show can be effectively automated by deriving rules for different types of model rates that arise commonly when mass-action mixing is assumed. Explicit computation of the time-shift distribution can be used to build a practical tool for the efficient generation of macroscopic trajectories of stochastic population models, without the need for costly stochastic simulations. Full code is provided to implement this and we demonstrate our method on an epidemic model and a model of within-host viral dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a faster direct sampling algorithm for random equilateral closed polygons in three-dimensional space. This method improves on the moment polytope sampling algorithm of Cantarella, Duplantier, Shonkwiler, and Uehara and has (expected) time per sample quadratic in the number of edges in the polygon.</description>

      <title>Rhombic staircase tableaux and Koornwinder polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming problems. Under some common regularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that the SAA's sample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric entropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a significantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing results. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that the SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, rectifying a long-standing theoretical discrepancy of the SAA from the SMD by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where the SAA maintains provable efficacy, whereas corresponding results for the SMD remain unexplored, indicating the potential of the SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Cost of excursions until first crossing of the origin for random walks and L\'evy flights: an exact general formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time random walk on a line starting at $x_0\geq 0$ where a cost is incurred at each jump. We obtain an exact analytical formula for the distribution of the total cost of a trajectory until the process crosses the origin for the first time. The formula is valid for arbitrary jump distribution and cost function (heavy- and light-tailed alike), provided they are symmetric and continuous. We analyze the formula in different scaling regimes, and find a high degree of universality with respect to the details of the jump distribution and the cost function. Applications are given to the motion of an active run-and-tumble particle in one dimension and extensions to multiple cost variables are considered. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with numerical simulations.</description>
