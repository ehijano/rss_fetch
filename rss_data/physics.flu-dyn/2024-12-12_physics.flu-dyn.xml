      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to reconstruct high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurement is critical for many science and engineering applications, but remains a huge challenge. This challenge is caused by the large difference between the dimensions of the state space and the observational space, making the operator that provides the mapping from the state space to the observational space ill-conditioned and non-invertible. As a result, deriving the forward map from the observational space to the state space as the inverse of the measurement operator is nearly impossible. While traditional methods, including sparse optimization, data assimilation, or machine learning based regressive reconstruction, are available, they often struggle with generalization and computational efficiency, particularly when non-uniform or varying discretization of the domain are considered. In this work, we propose FLRONet, a novel operator learning framework designed to reconstruct full-state flow fields from sparse sensor measurements in space and time. FLRONet utilizes a branch-trunk architecture, where the branch network integrates sensor observations from multiple time instances, and the trunk network encodes the entire temporal domain. This design allows FLRONet to achieve highly accurate, discretization-independent reconstructions at any time within the observation window. Although the popular three-dimensional Fourier Neural Operator offers similar functionalities, our results show that FLRONet surpasses it in both accuracy and efficiency. FLRONet not only achieves superior performance in approximating the true operator but also exhibits significantly faster inference at high-fidelity discretizations.</description>

      <title>Nascent water waves induced by the impulsive motion of a solid wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigated the generation phase of laboratory-scale water waves induced by the impulsive motion of a rigid piston, whose maximum velocity $U$ and total stroke $L$ are independently varied, as well as the initial liquid depth $h$. By doing so, the influence of two dimensionless numbers is studied: the Froude number $\mathrm{Fr}_p=U/(gh)^{1/2}$, with $g$ the gravitational acceleration, and the relative stroke $\Lambda_p =L/h$ of the piston. During the constant acceleration phase of the vertical wall, a transient water bump forms and remains localised in the vicinity of the piston, for all investigated parameters. Experiments with a small relative acceleration $\gamma/g$, where $\gamma=U^2/L$, are well captured by a first-order potential flow theory established by \citet{1990_joo}, which provides a fair estimate of the overall free surface elevation and the maximum wave amplitude reached at the contact with the piston. For large Froude numbers, an unsteady hydraulic jump theory is proposed, which accurately predicts the time evolution of the wave amplitude at the contact with the piston throughout the generation phase. At the end of the formation process, the dimensionless volume of the bump evolves linearly with $\Lambda_p$ and the wave aspect ratio is found to be governed by the relative acceleration $\gamma/g$. As the piston begins its constant deceleration, the water bump evolves into a propagating wave and several regimes are then reported and mapped in a phase diagram in the ($\mathrm{Fr}_p$, $\Lambda_p$) plane. While the transition from waves to water jets is observed if the typical acceleration of the piston is close enough to the gravitational acceleration $g$, the wave regimes are found to be mainly selected by the relative piston stroke $\Lambda_p$ while the Froude number determines whether the generated wave breaks or not.</description>

      <title>Pinning induced motion and internal flow in neighbouring evaporating multi-component drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of multi-component sessile droplets is key in many physicochemical applications such as inkjet printing, spray cooling, and micro-fabrication. Past fundamental research has primarily concentrated on single drops, though in applications they are rarely isolated. Here, we experimentally explore the effect of neighbouring drops on the evaporation process, employing direct imaging, confocal microscopy, and PTV. Remarkably, the centres of the drops move away from each other rather than towards each other, as we would expect due to the shielding effect at the side of the neighbouring drop and the resulting reduced evaporation on that side. We find that pinning-induced motion mediated by suspended particles in the droplets is the cause of this counter-intuitive behaviour. Finally, the azimuthal dependence of the radial velocity in the drop is compared to the evaporative flux and a perfect agreement is found.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic lubrication of a submerged cylinder sliding down an incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lubrication flows between two solid surfaces can be found in a variety of biological and engineering settings. In many of these systems, the lubricant exhibits viscoelastic properties, which modify the associated lubrication forces. Here, we experimentally study viscoelastic lubrication by considering the motion of a submerged cylinder sliding down an incline. We demonstrate that cylinders move faster when released in a viscoelastic Boger liquid compared to a Newtonian liquid with similar viscosity. Cylinders exhibit pure sliding motion in viscoelastic liquids, in contrast to the stick-slip motion observed in Newtonian liquids. We rationalize our results by using the second-order fluid model, which predicts a lift force on the cylinder arising from the normal-stress differences provided by the dissolved polymers. The interplay between viscoelastic lift, viscous friction, and gravity leads to a prediction for the sliding speed, which is consistent with our experimental results for weakly viscoelastic flows. Finally, we identify a remarkable difference between the lubrication of cylindrical and spherical contacts, as the latter does not exhibit any lift for weak viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Internally heated convection with rotation: bounds on heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates heat transport in rotating internally heated convection, for a horizontally periodic fluid between parallel plates under no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The main results are the proof of bounds on the mean temperature, $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$, and the heat flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$ at infinite Prandtl numbers where the Prandtl number is the nondimensional ratio of viscous to thermal diffusion. The lower bounds are functions of a Rayleigh number quantifying the ratio of internal heating to diffusion and the Ekman number, $E$, which quantifies the ratio of viscous diffusion to rotation. We utilise two different estimates on the vertical velocity, $w$, one pointwise in the domain (Yan 2004, J. Math. Phys., vol. 45(7), pp. 2718-2743) and the other an integral estimate over the domain (Constantin et al . 1999, Phys. D: Non. Phen., vol. 125, pp. 275-284), resulting in bounds valid for different regions of buoyancy-to-rotation dominated convection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that similar to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, for small $E$, the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection asymptotically scales as $E^{-4/3}$.This result is combined with heuristic arguments for internally heated and rotating convection to arrive at scaling laws for $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$ and $\mathcal{F}_B$ valid for arbitrary Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes problems: joint flow field reconstruction and parameter learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Autoregressive Conditional Diffusion Models for Turbulent Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating turbulent flows is crucial for a wide range of applications, and machine learning-based solvers are gaining increasing relevance. However, achieving temporal stability when generalizing to longer rollout horizons remains a persistent challenge for learned PDE solvers. In this work, we analyze if fully data-driven fluid solvers that utilize an autoregressive rollout based on conditional diffusion models are a viable option to address this challenge. We investigate accuracy, posterior sampling, spectral behavior, and temporal stability, while requiring that methods generalize to flow parameters beyond the training regime. To quantitatively and qualitatively benchmark the performance of various flow prediction approaches, three challenging 2D scenarios including incompressible and transonic flows, as well as isotropic turbulence are employed. We find that even simple diffusion-based approaches can outperform multiple established flow prediction methods in terms of accuracy and temporal stability, while being on par with state-of-the-art stabilization techniques like unrolling at training time. Such traditional architectures are superior in terms of inference speed, however, the probabilistic nature of diffusion approaches allows for inferring multiple predictions that align with the statistics of the underlying physics. Overall, our benchmark contains three carefully chosen data sets that are suitable for probabilistic evaluation alongside various established flow prediction architectures.</description>
