      <title>Multiscale Markowitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Markowitz portfolio optimization constrains daily portfolio variance to a target value, optimising returns, Sharpe or variance within this constraint. However, this approach overlooks the relationship between variance at different time scales, typically described by $\sigma(\Delta t) \propto (\Delta t)^{H}$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent, most of the time assumed to be \(\frac{1}{2}\). This paper introduces a multifrequency optimization framework that allows investors to specify target portfolio variance across a range of frequencies, characterized by a target Hurst exponent $H_{target}$, or optimize the portfolio at multiple time scales. By incorporating this scaling behavior, we enable a more nuanced and comprehensive risk management strategy that aligns with investor preferences at various time scales. This approach effectively manages portfolio risk across multiple frequencies and adapts to different market conditions, providing a robust tool for dynamic asset allocation. This overcomes some of the traditional limitations of Markowitz, when it comes to dealing with crashes, regime changes, volatility clustering or multifractality in markets. We illustrate this concept with a toy example and discuss the practical implementation for assets with varying scaling behaviors.</description>

      <title>Optimal portfolio under ratio-type periodic evaluation in stochastic factor models under convex trading constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a type of periodic utility maximization problems for portfolio management in incomplete stochastic factor models with convex trading constraints. The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the relative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon, featuring the dynamic adjustments in portfolio decision according to past achievements. Under power utility, we transform the original infinite horizon optimal control problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem under a modified utility function. To cope with the convex trading constraints, we further introduce an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem in a modified market model and develop the martingale duality approach to establish the existence of the dual minimizer such that the optimal unconstrained wealth process can be obtained using the dual representation. With the help of the duality results in the auxiliary problems, the relationship between the constrained and unconstrained models as well as some fixed point arguments, we finally derive and verify the optimal constrained portfolio process in a periodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>
