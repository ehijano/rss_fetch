      <title>Latent Chemical Space Searching for Plug-in Multi-objective Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular generation, an essential method for identifying new drug structures, has been supported by advancements in machine learning and computational technology. However, challenges remain in multi-objective generation, model adaptability, and practical application in drug discovery. In this study, we developed a versatile 'plug-in' molecular generation model that incorporates multiple objectives related to target affinity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability, facilitating its application in various drug development contexts. We improved the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the context of drug discoveries, and identified PSO-ENP as the optimal variant for multi-objective molecular generation and optimization through comparative experiments. The model also incorporates a novel target-ligand affinity predictor, enhancing the model's utility by supporting three-dimensional information and improving synthetic feasibility. Case studies focused on generating and optimizing drug-like big marine natural products were performed, underscoring PSO-ENP's effectiveness and demonstrating its considerable potential for practical drug discovery applications.</description>

      <title>VN-EGNN: E(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Nodes Enhance Protein Binding Site Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to identify regions within or around proteins, to which ligands can potentially bind, is an essential step to develop new drugs. Binding site identification methods can now profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions. Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of GNNs at binding site identification is still limited potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this work, we extend E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) by adding virtual nodes and applying an extended message passing scheme. The virtual nodes in these graphs are dedicated quantities to learn representations of binding sites, which leads to improved predictive performance. In our experiments, we show that our proposed method VN-EGNN sets a new state-of-the-art at locating binding site centers on COACH420, HOLO4K and PDBbind2020.</description>
