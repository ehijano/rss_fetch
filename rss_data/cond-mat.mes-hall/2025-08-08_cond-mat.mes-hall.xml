      <title>Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of \sigma-\pi coupling and mode selection in optically trapped artificial polariton molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic Design of Bias-Free Reconfigurable Microwave Properties in Hexagonal Shaped Multilayer Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic miniaturized nanostructures hold great promise for current and future microwave technologies due to their magnetization dynamics in the GHz frequency range. This work presents a method for investigating reconfigurable microwave properties using a novel hexagonal nanomagnet structure. Micromagnetic simulations are employed to investigate the magnetic static and dynamic properties of the nanomagnets. A simple field initialization method is used to examine two distinct magnetic remanent states in each sample. A nanosecond-width magnetic pulse field can be applied to tune the unique magnetization dynamics parameters corresponding to the different remanent states. Find that for both single-layer and multilayer nanomagnets, there is a notable frequency shift in the sub-GHz and GHz regions between the two distinct magnetic remanent states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tenfold classification provides a powerful framework for organizing topological phases of matter based on symmetry and spatial dimension. However, it does not offer a systematic method for transitioning between classes or engineering materials to realize desired topological properties. In this work, we introduce a general method for designing topological materials by embedding defects or spatial textures, which alter symmetry or dimension. This enables controlled navigation across the tenfold table, allowing one to induce topological phase transitions on demand. We illustrate this approach through several nontrivial examples, demonstrating how local defects can generate phases with different symmetries and topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Chern junctions in Moir\'e-Patterned Graphene/PbI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding the moir\'e material library continues to unlock novel quantum phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into the moir\'e family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moir\'e superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at 2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with distinct Chern numbers originating from moir\'e-modulated and conventional integer quantum Hall states. The moir\'e Hofstadter spectrum displays an unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing spin-orbit-enhanced moir\'e phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport in two-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum spin Hall states and topological current divider in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that topological quantum spin Hall (QSH) state exist in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. However, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the topological edge states remains a topic of interest and an unresolved issue. Here, the topological transport properties of the twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers are investigated. Beyond the conventional single QSH, we identify emergent double and quartuple quantum spin Hall states, hosting two and four pairs of counter-propagating helical edge channels respectively. Furthermore, the charge carriers in these edge states are not localized at edge but rather the high potential point of the moire superlattice boundary, undergoing interlayer transitions and propagating forward continuously. We term these edge states as moire edge states. These edge states can survive in non-magnetic disorder, with the robustness of double QSH states surpassing that of single QSH states. At a twisting angle of 2.45$^\circ$, the transition between the single and double QSH states can be achieved by adjusting the gate on the surface. Based on this, we propose a five-terminal device to as a topological current devider. Our findings provide support for the development of dissipationless spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Size Dependent Bi- and Tri-exciton Characteristics in CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots via Ensemble Time Gated Heralded Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiexcitons (MXs) in quantum dots (QDs) manifest many body interactions under quantum confinement. Beyond this fundamental interest, MXs are of importance in numerous optoelectronic applications including QD lasing, light emitting diodes and photocatalysis. Yet, the strong interactions between MXs leading to rapid non-radiative decay introduce challenges for their characterization. While so far, the measurement techniques rely either on indirect methods or on single particle studies, herein we introduce a new method to study MXs in QD ensembles utilizing spectrally resolved time-gated heralded spectroscopy. With this approach we extract the biexciton binding energies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes, manifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton interactions. Additionally, for triexcitons, which involve occupation of two excitons in the 1s energy levels, as well as one exciton in the 1p energy levels, we address the open issues of isolating the spectra of the two triexciton pathways from one another and from high-order MXs, and extract the MX lifetimes. The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low noise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the observation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single particle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the characterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to enable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties. Such insight bears relevance to optoelectronic applications ranging from lasing to electroluminescent devices to quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Stacking-induced type-II quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin Chern number in unconventional magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.</description>

      <title>Negative differential conductance in triangular molecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the creation and characterization of a molecular-scale negative differential conductance (NDC) device by assembling a triangular trimer of 4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules on a superconducting Pb(111) substrate. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we observe robust NDC behavior manifesting as a decrease in current with increasing voltage between 0.7-0.9 V arising from the interplay of Coulomb blockade and strong inter-molecular capacitive coupling within the molecular cluster. Gate-controlled charging and discharging processes are directly visualized via two-dimensional differential conductance mapping, which reveals the emergence of Coulomb rings and spatial regions of NDC. Theoretical modeling using a three-impurity Anderson model and master equation approach quantitatively reproduces the experimental observations and demonstrates that the NDC emerges purely from electron correlations, independent of the underlying superconductivity. By tuning the geometry to a hexamer structure, we further show that cluster topology provides versatile control over electronic properties at the molecular scale. These results establish a functional platform for implementing multifunctional molecular devices and highlight a strategy toward programmable and scalable nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal inertial spin-wave dynamics in twisted magnetic nanostrips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for inertial spin-wave dynamics in three-dimensional twisted soft-magnetic nanostrips, where curvature and torsion couple with magnetic inertia to generate terahertz (THz) magnetic oscillations. The resulting spin-wave spectra exhibit pronounced nonreciprocity due to effective symmetry breaking arising from geometric chirality and inertial effects. We show that this behavior is governed by a curvature-induced geometric (Berry) phase, which we analytically capture through compact expressions for dispersion relations and spectral linewidths in both nutational (THz) and precessional (GHz) regimes. Topological variations, including M\"obius and helical geometries, impose distinct wavenumber quantization rules, elucidating the role of topology in spin-wave transport. These results position twisted magnetic strips as a viable platform for curvilinear THz magnonics and nonreciprocal spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of Au Ion Implantation on 2D $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 2D magnetic materials highlight their potential in semiconductors, magnetism, and spintronics, particularly in tuning magnetic properties for spintronic applications. This study investigates the impact of low-energy (30 KeV) Au ion implantation on 2D layered exfoliated $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ flakes prepared on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates using the Scotch tape method. Five different ion doses (5$\times10^{13}$, 1$\times10^{14}$, 5$\times10^{14}$, 1$\times10^{15}$, and 2.5$\times10^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$) were used to modify the morphology, composition, structural, and vibrational properties of the samples. The implantation introduces significant changes in morphology and magnetic behavior, leading to an increase in Curie temperature and an attribution from superexchange to double exchange interactions. The reduced exchange energy gaps and modified magnetic moments attribute to Au ions intercalation in $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ underscore the potential of ions implantation to tune the magnetic properties of 2D materials for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>peaks: a Python package for analysis of angle-resolved photoemission and related spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic band structure, describing the motion and interactions of electrons in materials, dictates the electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties of solids. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct experimental probe of such electronic band structures, and so is widely employed in the study of functional, quantum, and 2D materials. \texttt{peaks} (\textbf{P}ython \textbf{E}lectron spectroscopy \textbf{A}nalysis by \textbf{K}ing group @ \textbf{S}t Andrews) provides a Python package for advanced data analysis of ARPES and related spectroscopic data. It facilitates the fast visualisation and analysis of multi-dimensional datasets, allows for the complex data hierarchy typical to ARPES experiments, and supports lazy data loading and parallel processing, reflecting the ever-increasing data volumes used in ARPES. It is designed to be run in an interactive notebook environment, with extensive inline and pop-out GUI support for data visualisation.</description>

      <title>Robust surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found a peculiar surface superconducting state with a critical temperature two orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence in this new surface superconducting state. Here we measure the superconducting gap and visualize the vortex lattice through very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We find vortices that are anomalously mobile and show that the extremely weak electrostatic interaction between the vortex charge and the STM tip is sufficient to drag the vortices of the surface superconductor. Our results show that surface superconductivity with $T_c=2.9$ K and $H_{c2}\approx 1.8$ T is extraordinarily robust in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$. Furthermore, quasiparticle scattering is enhanced at the position in the reciprocal space of the Fermi arcs, suggesting a connection between Weyl points and surface superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-TODD-G: Novel 2D Planar Carbon Allotropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of three novel two-dimensional carbon allotropes: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-TODD-Graphene (TODD-G), composed of 3-8-12-16, 3-8-12-16, and 3-4-8-12 interconnected carbon rings with sp/sp2 hybridization, respectively. Structural optimization, phonon spectra, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their thermal and dynamical stability. All phases exhibit metallic electronic behavior, with distinct Dirac-like features and tilted Dirac cones that suggest anisotropic charge transport. Mechanical analysis reveals tunable anisotropy: alpha-TODD-G is strongly anisotropic, beta-TODD-G shows moderate anisotropy, and gamma-TODD-G displays an almost isotropic mechanical response. Optical spectra further differentiate the phases, with gamma-TODD-G showing strong absorption in the infrared region, while alpha- and beta-TODD-G mainly absorb in the visible and ultraviolet ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the coexistence of Aharonov-Bohm and Little-Parks oscillations in mesoscopic Fe(Te,Se) rings. The magnetoresistance shows two distinct periodicities: an $h/e$ component from ballistic edge interference and an $h/2e$ component from fluxoid quantization of Cooper pairs. Aharonov-Bohm oscillations persist deep into the superconducting phase, exhibit current-field symmetry, and follow a temperature dependence captured by a helical Luttinger liquid model, consistent with edge states in a topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap symmetry of 2DEG at (111)-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of the two-dimensional electron gas at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Using a multiorbital tight-binding model defined on a hexagonal lattice, we analyze the emergence of superconductivity driven by both interlayer (nearest-neighbor) and intralayer (next-nearest-neighbor) pairing interactions, with a particular focus on the symmetry of the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that, in both pairing scenarios, the superconducting gap transforms according to the $A_1$ irreducible representation of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Within the interlayer pairing scenario, the superconducting phase is characterized by a fully gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibiting extended $s$-wave symmetry, accompanied by an enhancement of the superconducting gap magnitude in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity. Conversely, the intralayer pairing channel produces a distinctive double-dome structure in the superconducting phase diagram, with the gap symmetry evolving from a fully gapped, extended $s$-wave at low carrier densities to a nodal extended $s$-wave state at higher electron concentrations. The qualitative agreement with experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of the critical temperature $T_c(V_g)$ suggests that intralayer next-nearest-neighbor pairing may play a dominant role in the superconductivity of the (111) LAO/STO interface.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian superconducting diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of non-reciprocal phenomena has long captivated interest in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a non-reciprocal phenomenon characterized by unequal critical charge supercurrents flowing in opposite directions in Hermitian superconducting systems. In this study, we introduce an SDE driven by non-Hermiticity in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) under an external magnetic flux, which we refer to as the non-Hermitian SDE. Non-Hermiticity is introduced by coupling one of the two Josephson junctions to a gapless electron reservoir, introducing phase decoherence. Remarkably, we find that an emergent non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution can give rise to SDE in the non-Hermitian SQUID. We analyze the behavior of the SDE under both direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) biases, highlighting the appearance of direction-dependent critical currents and asymmetric Shapiro steps as hallmarks of the SDE. Our findings not only reveal an experimentally accessible mechanism for non-Hermitian SDE but also open new avenues for investigating non-reciprocal phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spin-to-charge conversion in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/NdNiO$_3$ bilayers at the nickelate metal-insulator phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transition materials such as NdNiO3 (NNO) when coupled with low damping ferromagnets such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) can lead to new multi-functional material systems harnessing the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with optically active monolayers for nanolasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an optically active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <title>Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of Bose-Einstein condensate and superfluidity at remarkably high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism and develop a theory for nonreciprocal Coulomb drag resistance. This effect arises in electron double-layer systems in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric conductors or in bilayers with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and without Galilean invariance. We demonstrate the significance of this effect by examining the hydrodynamic regime of the electron liquid. The nonreciprocal component of the transresistance is shown to sensitively depend on the intrinsic conductivity, viscosity of the fluid, and the emergent nonreciprocity parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and robust protocol for quantum-enhanced sensing using a single qubit in the topological waveguide system. Our method relies on the topological-paired bound states, which are localized near the qubit and can be effectively regarded as a two-level system. Through the lens of Bayesian inference theory, we show that the sensitivity can reach the Heisenberg limit across a large field range. Inheriting from the topological robustness of the waveguide, our sensing protocol is robust against local perturbations. Besides, our sensing protocol utilizes a product state as the initial state, which can be easily prepared in experiments. We expect this approach would pave the way toward robust topological quantum sensors based on near-term quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits and Rydberg arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases are predicted to possess an anomalous ''tomographic'' transport regime that is marked by an odd-even effect in the relaxation times, with odd-parity deformations of the Fermi surface becoming long-lived in comparison to even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that neutral two-component atomic Fermi gases also exhibit this tomographic effect. By diagonalizing the Fermi liquid collision integral, we identify odd-parity modes with anomalously long lifetimes below temperatures $T\leq 0.15T_F$, which is within reach of cold atom experiments. Furthermore, in contrast to electron gases, we find that the odd-even effect in neutral gases is widely tuneable with interactions along the BCS-BEC crossover and is suppressed on the BEC side. We propose as an experimental signature of the odd-even effect the damping rate of quadrupole oscillations, which is anomalously enhanced due to the presence of long-lived odd-parity modes. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of two-dimensional Fermi gases is richer than previously thought and should include additional long-lived modes.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>
