      <title>Wetting in Associating Lattice Gas Model Confined by Hydrophilic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through Monte Carlo simulations and the Associating Lattice Gas Model, the phases of a two-dimensional fluid under hydrophilic confinement are evaluated. The model, in its unconfined version, reproduces the anomalous behavior of water regarding its density, diffusion, and solubility, among other dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Extreme confinements suppress phase transitions since fluctuations suppress ordering. The fluid under hydrophilic confinement forms a single wetting layer that gradually wets the wall. From the wetting layer, the low-density liquid structure is formed. The confined fluid presents a first-order liquid-liquid transition, but always at lower temperatures than that observed in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Micro-transfer printing of GaSb optoelectronics chips for mid-infrared silicon photonics integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D integration of GaSb-based gain chips on a silicon photonics platform using micro-transfer printing is demonstrated for the first time. The release process of GaSb coupons, and their transfer for the demonstration of hybrid GaSb/Silicon-photonics on-chip external cavity lasers is reported. A methodology to evaluate the key features of the gain chip coupons, namely the quality of the etched facets and the facet coating deposited using a wafer-level process, is introduced. The characterization provides insight into the fabrication factors limiting the performance of the gain coupons. The level of performance achieved for the transfer printing process offers a solid landmark for the development of photonics integration technology operating at the 2-3 $\mu$m wavelength range. This is instrumental for the deployment of mid-IR photonic integration technology in emerging applications related to gas and biomarker sensing.</description>

      <title>InP optical amplifiers with Euler U-bend waveguide geometry for low-loss flip-chip hybrid integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of InP-based semiconductor amplifiers with a U-bend waveguide geometry having the input and output ports on one facet only. This waveguide geometry simplifies the chip alignment during the hybrid integration on silicon photonics platforms ultimately reducing the coupling losses, improving the integration yield, and minimizing the length of the optoelectronic chip. To achieve low loss U-bends with small footprint, we utilize the Euler bend geometry previously demonstrated on silicon and GaAs platforms. We analyze the gain properties of the devices by operating them as laser diodes at room temperature. Low loss U-bend performance with a 0.56 dB for a 50 $\mu$m effective bending radius bend in a single-mode strip InP waveguide is demonstrated. The interface between bend and straight waveguides was studied by comparing deep etched waveguides to a combination of shallow straight waveguides and deep etched bends. The effects of this interface on the device losses, electric properties and spectrum are reported. The implications related to having a bend section on the carrier injection and gain are discussed. Finally, results on the integration trials on silicon-on-insulator platform are presented.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Model for a Full Fusion Tokamak Enabled by Supercomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining stress and strain in a component of a fusion power plant involves defining boundary conditions for the mechanical equilibrium equations, implying the availability of a full reactor model for defining those conditions. To address this fundamental challenge of reactor design, a finite element method (FEM) model for the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak Upgrade (MAST-U) fusion tokamak, operating at the Culham Campus of UKAEA, has been developed and applied to assess mechanical deformations, strain, and stress in the full tokamak structure, taken as a proxy for a fusion power plant. The model, handling 127 million finite elements using about 800 processors in parallel, illustrates the level of fidelity of structural simulations of a complex nuclear device made possible by the modern supercomputing systems. The model predicts gravitational and atmospheric pressure-induced deformations in broad agreement with observations, and enables computing the spectrum of acoustic vibrations of a tokamak, arising from mechanical disturbances like an earthquake or a plasma disruption. We introduce the notion of the density of stress to characterise the distribution of stress in the entire solid body of the tokamak, and to predict the magnitude and locations of stress concentrations. The model enables defining computational requirements for simulating a whole operating fusion power plant, and provides a digital foundation for the assessment of reactor performance as well as for specifying the relevant materials testing programme.</description>

      <title>Optical training of large-scale Transformers and deep neural networks with direct feedback alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOps. We perform optical training of one of the most recent deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on both language and vision tasks. We study the compute scaling of our hybrid optical approach, and demonstrate a potential advantage for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</description>

      <title>A Ray Tracing Survey of Asymmetric Operation of the X-ray Rowland Circle Using Spherically Bent Crystal Analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherically bent crystal analyzer (SBCA) is a widely-adopted hard x-ray optic, renowned for its good energy resolution and large collection solid angle. It is frequently employed in synchrotron-based techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) and X-ray Emission Spectroscopy, as well as in the rebirth of laboratory-based X-ray Absorption Fine Strucure (XAFS) and XES, and its predominant use has been in 'symmetric' operation on the Rowland circle. The recent study of Gironda et al. (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2024, 39, 1375) emphasizes the benefits of 'asymmetric' SBCA operation, demonstrating the use of multiple crystal reflections from a single SBCA to broaden its accessible energy range. Furthermore, Gironda et al. demonstrate that asymmetric operation frequently mitigates energy broadening intrinsic to Johann optics and propose that under a specific Rowland circle configuration, designated here the Johann Normal Alignment (JNA), such broadening is eradicated altogether. We report extensive ray tracing simulations to scrutinize the impact of asymmetric configurations on energy broadening and detector plane defocusing. We find that the performance of asymmetric SBCA operation generally exceeds its symmetric counterpart in energy resolution when no analyzer masking is used and, with strategic detector placement, the decrease in detection efficiency due to defocusing can be minimized. Spectroscopic imaging is adversely affected by the detector plane blurring, but rejection of scattering from special environment windows in x-ray Raman imaging is still feasible. These results help inform future, more common implementation of asymmetric reflections with SBCA.</description>

      <title>Solid-liquid equilibria and excess enthalpies in binary mixtures of propiophenone with some aliphatic amides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solid-liquid equilibria and excess enthalpies of the binary systems of propiophenone and {N-methylformamide, or N,N-dimethylformamide, or N,N-dimethylacetamide, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone} were measured. The SLE datawere determined by the cloud-point method, partly supplemented by the DSC technique. The excess enthalpieswere measured by the titration calorimetry at 298.15 K and 308.15 K for all the systems and additionally at 293.15 K and 318.15 K for the system with N-methylformamide, and at 293.15 K for the system with N,N-dimethylformamide. The activity coefficients of both components as a function of concentration and temperature were calculated by the correlation which included both types of data. The results of the prediction by the modified UNIFAC model were comparedwith the experimental data. The observed trends and differences between the systems were discussed.</description>

      <title>Heat Transfer Coefficients of Moving Particle Beds from Flow-Dependent Particle Bed Thermal Conductivity and Near-Wall Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of heat transfer coefficients for flowing packed particle beds is essential to the design of particle heat exchangers, and other thermal processes. While such dense granular flows fall into the well-known plug-flow regime, the discrete nature of granular materials alters the thermal transport processes in both the near-wall and bulk regions of flowing particle beds from their stationary counterparts. As a result, heat transfer correlations based on the stationary particle bed thermal conductivity could be inadequate for flowing particles in a heat exchanger. Earlier works have achieved reasonable agreement with experiments by treating granular media as a plug-flow continuum with a near-wall thermal resistance in series. However, the properties of the continuum were often obtained from measurements on stationary beds owing to the difficulty of flowing bed measurements. In this work, it was found that the properties of a stationary bed are highly sensitive to the method of particle packing and there is a decrease in the particle bed thermal conductivity and increase in the near-wall thermal resistance, measured as an effective air gap thickness, on the onset of particle flow. These variations in the thermophysical properties of stationary and flowing particle beds can lead to errors in heat transfer coefficient calculations. Therefore, the heat transfer coefficients for granular flows were calculated using experimentally determined flowing particle bed thermal conductivity and near-wall air gap for ceramic particles -CARBOCP40/100(275 um), HSP40/70(404um) and HSP16/30(956um); at velocities of 5-15mms-1; and temperatures of 300-650C. The thermal conductivity and air gap values for CP40/100 and HSP40/70 were further used to calculate heat transfer coefficients across different particle bed temperatures and velocities for different parallel-plate heat exchanger dimensions.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity in Amorphous Hafnium Oxide (HfO2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, inherent in all materials, offers a promising alternative to piezoelectricity for nanoscale actuation and sensing. However, its widespread application faces significant challenges: differentiating flexoelectric effects from those of piezoelectricity and other phenomena, verifying its universality across all material structures and thicknesses, and establishing a comprehensive database of flexoelectric coefficients across different materials. This work introduces a groundbreaking methodology that accurately isolates flexoelectricity from piezoelectric, electrostrictive and electrostatic effects, with a detection threshold extending below 1 fC/m. The robustness of this method is demonstrated through its application to amorphous hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$), successfully measuring a flexoelectric coefficient of 105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m. This measurement signifies the first measurement of flexoelectricity in hafnia, as well as in any amorphous material. Additionally, the study compiles a list of published flexoelectric coefficients, revealing an important insight. The relationship between the flexoelectric coefficient and the material's relative permittivity is better approximated by a quadratic proportionality. This challenges the traditional linear assumption proposed in Kogan's work and opens new avenues for future research in flexoelectric materials.</description>
