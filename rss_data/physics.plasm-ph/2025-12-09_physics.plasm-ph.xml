      <title>A Method for Solving Linearized Vlasov Equation for Low-Frequency Long-Wavelength Electromagnetic Modes in Inhomogeneous Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for solving linearized Vlasov equation for low-frequency, long-wavelength electromagnetic modes in magnetically confined inhomogeneous plasmas is described. The relevant non-local solution that includes the lowest-significant-order effects of inhomogeneities is obtained from the solutions of three simple equations by means of elementary algebra. The method appears to be more convenient than the commonly used method of integration along the unperturbed particle orbits and should be of interest to students of theoretical plasma physics.</description>

      <title>3D PIC Simulations on Hall Thruster Electron Drift Instability: Influence of Magnetic Field on Electron Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to investigate electron transport characteristics in Hall thrusters, with particular focus on how magnetic field configuration affects the electron transport due to electron drift instabilities. Comparing analytic and realistic magnetic field models reveals significant differences in electron transport patterns, where radial variations in field strength lead to asymmetric transport enhanced in low-field regions. The derived effective electron mobility shows agreement with direct simulation diagnoses, and the obtained two-dimensional transport profiles provide a foundation for developing more accurate reduced-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Solitons in Quasi-Neutral non-Equilibrated Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an experiment performed in November 2022 at the one-petawatt (PW) laser facility Vega III in Salamanca, Spain, we studied the production of several radioisotopes using the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method (M. Rodrigues et al. [1], K. Batani et al. [12]). Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -&gt; 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Solitons drive the system toward charge neutrality. We derive an effective soliton mass of ms = (26 +/- 1) meV and a soliton speed on the order of vs/c ~ 0.06. Understanding the soliton dynamics is crucial for applications and basic science.</description>

      <title>FGE: A Fast Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid simulation of the free boundary tokamak plasma equilibrium evolution is essential for modern plasma control, stability analysis, and scenario development. This paper presents the Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive (FGE) code, a highly flexible and control-oriented solver designed to address the challenges posed by advanced plasma configurations across a range of devices. FGE evolved from the FBT and LIUQE codes and is part of the MEQ suite, sharing many of the low-level optimized functions. It self-consistently solves the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov equation coupled with circuit equations for external conductors and models for plasma profile evolution. The code implements a fully non-linear, Newton-based framework with multiple, highly optimized solver options, state representations, and residual formulations that enable rapid computation across different simulation setups. A key capability is the self-consistent integration of various 0D and 1D current diffusion equations (CDEs) to model the resistive evolution of the plasma current profile as well as the ability to model plasmas with multiple magnetic axes (Doublets). Furthermore, FGE allows to linearize the plasma dynamics around a given equilibrium to generate a state-space model suitable for controller design and analysis. Numerical studies are presented demonstrating the code's speed of convergence and validating its performance against experimental data. Furthermore, benchmarks against the RAPTOR and KINX codes for profile evolution and vertical growth rate estimates are presented highlighting FGE's capabilities for both prediction and analysis.</description>

      <title>BO-PBK: A comprehensive solver for dispersion relations of obliquely propagating waves in magnetized multi-species plasma with anisotropic loss-cone drift product-bi-kappa distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BO-PBK (BO-Product-Bi-Kappa), a new solver for kinetic dispersion relations of obliquely propagating waves in magnetized plasmas with complex velocity distributions. It reformulates the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system into a compact eigenvalue problem, enabling direct computation of multiple wave branches and unstable modes without iterative initial-value searches. Key innovations include a unified framework supporting product-bi-kappa, kappa-Maxwellian, bi-Maxwellian, and hybrid distributions with multi-component and loss-cone features; a concise rational-form eigenvalue formulation; and a 2--3 times reduction in matrix dimensions compared to the BO-KM solver, with improved efficiency at larger kappa indices. Benchmark tests confirm accurate reproduction of standard kinetic results and efficient resolution of waves and instabilities. BO-PBK thus provides a computationally efficient tool for wave and stability analysis in space and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Modified vacuum polarization in the presence of a plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vacuum polarization due to strong fields, in the presence of an electron-positron plasma. For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles. The implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Collisional passing alpha energy transport in nearly quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in stellarator optimization have found nearly precise quasisymmetric configurations. These are expected to reduce the non-turbulent background plasma transport to acceptable neoclassical levels while removing nearly all collisionless direct orbit losses of alpha particles. Yet, alpha particles under resonant conditions can be very sensitive to collisions, causing concerning energy losses and damaging plasma facing components. For the passing alphas such resonances can happen near rational surfaces in the presence of helical error field departures from quasisymmetry that change the magnetic field direction and magnitude. The cancellation between streaming motion and tangential drift of the alphas enhances the effective collision frequency, allowing the formation of a collisional boundary layer and giving rise to a perturbed distribution function. We develop an analytical model to illustrate and evaluate the resonant plateau transport this mechanism causes by formulating a drift kinetic treatment. The results indicate the associated energy losses can become significant in the vicinity of rational surfaces at values of q=m/n when error fields with poloidal and toroidal numbers m and n are present. In addition, we investigate the validity of the quasilinear approximation to the energy flux to show that it imposes a restriction on the error field amplitude that can be considered.</description>

      <title>The influence of Parker spiral on the reflection-driven turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfv\'en speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it "cuts across" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</description>

      <title>Radiation pattern and source size of particles in nanoplasmonic fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05156v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the angular radiation patterns of proton, deuteron or alpha emission we present a way using particle-in-cell simulation of laser induced nanoplasmonic fusion. The differential Hanbury-Brown and Twiss analysis is widely used in astrophysics and in relativistic heavy ion physics to determine the source size of emitted particles. Here, we show how this method could be adopted for inertial confinement fusion. This method aims to determine the parameters of emitted nuclei after the fusion target ignition. In addition to spatial volume, the method can detect specific space-time correlation patterns connected to the collective flow post-ignition. In the NAPLIFE project our aim is to avoid thermalization and fluidization as much as possible at each stage of the fusion process. As the original laser beam is non-thermal and not equilibrated in any way it is obvious that we can minimize energy loss if we exploit the initial available energy in a non-thermal way. The detailed dynamics of deuterium and alpha production is not aimed at and not addressed by this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. For a cubic temperature the equilibrium has an analytic solution which is investigated.</description>

      <title>Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>First Electron Acceleration in a Tunable-Velocity Laser Wakefield</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>
