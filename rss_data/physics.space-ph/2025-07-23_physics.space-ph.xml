      <title>Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun (TARS) for Interstellar Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of exploring space using solar power is energetically appealing, but interstellar solar sails typically require extremely low areal densities (~0.8 g/m^2). This work explores an alternative approach: storing solar energy as rotational kinetic energy, which is later released to propel a microprobe beyond the solar system. The proposed Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun (TARS) consists of two thin surfaces with contrasting albedos that gradually spins up over weeks to months while in a sub-Keplerian "quasite" orbit around the Sun. Though constrained by material strengths, careful design allows a phone-sized payload to reach interstellar velocities in less than a year, using commercially available materials (e.g. CNT sheets). The entire system spans tens of meters and weighs of order of a kilogram. Whilst there is no theoretical limit to the achievable speeds, practical designs grow exponentially in size as velocity targets increase, making interstellar flight feasible but relativistic speeds implausible. Several strategies, including the use of graphene sheets, gravity assists, the Oberth effect, and electrostatic confinement, could further maximise velocity. TARS is an attractive light sail technology when high-powered directed energy systems are impractical, offering a potentially low-cost solution for deploying small, sub-relativistic interstellar probes.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>One year of ASPEX-SWIS operation -- Characteristic features, observations and science potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aditya-L1 mission, India's first dedicated solar observatory positioned at the first Lagrange point (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, carries the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) as part of the ASPEX payload suite. Even before settling into its Halo orbit, SWIS has been providing nearly continuous in-situ measurements of solar wind ion spectra. Moments of the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) have been calculated to derive key solar wind parameters such as density, bulk speed, and temperature. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. A detailed case study of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event on August 7, 2024, is presented, where sharp changes in bulk speed, thermal speed, and number density were found to be well-aligned with independent observations-confirming the instrument's ability to capture dynamic solar wind features. Spectral analysis of kinetic fluctuations revealed a well-defined inertial range with a spectral slope consistent with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Furthermore, a 17-month statistical comparison (from January 2024 to May 2025) shows a strong correlation in bulk velocity (R2 = 0.94 with Wind), with expected variations in thermal speed and density arising from differences between instruments. These findings demonstrate the scientific value of AL1-ASPEX-SWIS for monitoring both transient solar events and long-term solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observation of Mini-Filament Eruptions Near Coronal Hole Boundary and Their Response in Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated mini-filament (MF) eruptions near coronal hole (CH) boundaries to explore their role in coronal dynamics and their potential contributions to the solar wind. Using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory and EUV data from AIA 193 \AA~ from Solar Dynamic Observatory, we analyzed 28 MFE events over 7.5 hours of observation spanning 5 days. Three largest MF eruptions triggered distinct coronal responses: two consecutive MFEs produced a small-scale eruptive coronal ejection, while the other generated a jet-like brightening. Furthermore, the 25 smaller-scale MFEs were associated with localized brightenings in coronal bright points (CBPs). These findings suggest that MFs play a significant role in transferring mass and magnetic flux to the corona, particularly within CH regions. We found certain trend that the size of MFEs is correlated with the EUV emissions. In addition, we observed magnetic flux cancellation associated with MFEs. However, except for a few largest MFEs, quantitative analysis of magnetic field evolution is beyond the capability of the data. These results underscore the importance of MFEs in the dynamic coupling between the chromosphere and corona, highlighting their potential role in shaping heliospheric structures. Although current study covers smallest MFEs ever studied, future higher-cadence, more accurate magnetograms and multi-wavelength observations are essential to fully resolve the fine-scale dynamics of these ubiquitous solar phenomena.</description>
