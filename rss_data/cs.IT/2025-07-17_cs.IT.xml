      <title>Sub-Connected Hybrid Beamfocusing Design for RSMA-Enabled Near-Field Communications with Imperfect CSI and SIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field spherical waves inherently encode both direction and distance information, enabling spotlight-like beam focusing for targeted interference mitigation. However, whether such beam focusing can fully eliminate interference under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI), rendering advanced interference management schemes unnecessary, remains an open question. To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our transmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation. A minimum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the analog beamfocuser, the digital beamfocuser, and the common rate allocation. To solve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal analog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital beamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore that: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even under perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA under imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture delivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio frequency chains.</description>

      <title>The Role of Rank in Mismatched Low-Rank Symmetric Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Bayesian statistician tasked with recovering a rank-\(k\) signal matrix \(\bS \bS^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), corrupted by element-wise additive Gaussian noise. This problem lies at the core of numerous applications in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic mean-square error (MSE) of the Bayesian estimator under mismatches in the assumed signal rank, signal power, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering both sphere and Gaussian signals. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of how rank mismatch influences the asymptotic MSE. Our primary technical tools include the spectrum of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) with low-rank perturbations and asymptotic behavior of \(k\)-dimensional spherical integrals.</description>

      <title>On the error correction of iterative bounded distance decoding of generalized LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an ensemble of regular generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes and assume that the same component code is associated with each parity check node. To decode a GLDPC code from the ensemble, we use the bit flipping bounded distance decoding algorithm, which is an extension of the bit flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically. We discuss the extension of our results to non-binary GLDPC codes and present numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Characterization and constructions of binary self-orthogonal singly-even linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has focused extensively on constructing binary self-orthogonal (SO) linear codes due to their applications in quantum information theory, lattice design, and related areas. Despite significant activity, the fundamental characterization remains unchanged: binary SO codes are necessarily even (all codeword weights even), while doubly-even codes (weights divisible by $4$) are automatically SO.
  This paper advances the theory by addressing the understudied case of singly-even (even but not doubly-even) SO codes. We first provide a complete characterization of binary SO linear codes, and a necessary and sufficient condition for binary SO singly-even linear codes is given. Moreover, we give a general approach to generating many binary SO linear codes from two known SO linear codes, yielding three infinite classes of binary SO singly-even linear codes with few weights. Note that these new codes are also minimal and violate the Aschikhmin-Barg condition. Their weight distributions are determined. Furthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Boolean function $f$ such that the linear code proposed from $f$ via a well-known generic construction is SO singly-even, and a general approach to constructing Boolean functions satisfying this condition is provided, yielding several infinite classes of binary SO singly-even minimal linear codes with few weights. Finally, we would like to emphasize that using the methods in this paper, we can construct more binary linear codes that are SO, singly-even, minimal, violating the AB condition, and with few weights at the same time.</description>

      <title>Neural Polar Decoders for Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.</description>

      <title>Efficient Remote Monitoring through Noisy Random Access with Retransmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a rare event monitoring system consisting of a set of devices and a base station, where devices transmit information about rare events to the base station using a random multiple access scheme. We introduce a model in which the presence of noise in the multiple access channel can cause message loss even in the absence of transmission collisions. The occurrence of events is modeled by a family of independent two-state Markov chains (with states 0 and 1). We analyze how repeated transmissions affect system performance. Two efficiency criteria are proposed and studied: the maximum probability that a message about an event from a fixed device is successfully delivered to the base station and the maximum frequency at which the base station successfully receives updates about the entire system. For each criterion, we determine the optimal number of retransmissions as a function of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Search and Retrieval Over Erasure Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a search and retrieval model that adopts key semantic communication principles from retrieval-augmented generation. We specifically present an information-theoretic analysis of a remote document retrieval system operating over a symbol erasure channel. The proposed model encodes the feature vector of a query, derived from term-frequency weights of a language corpus by using a repetition code with an adaptive rate dependent on the contextual importance of the terms. At the decoder, we select between two documents based on the contextual closeness of the recovered query. By leveraging a jointly Gaussian approximation for both the true and reconstructed similarity scores, we derive an explicit expression for the retrieval error probability, i.e., the probability under which the less similar document is selected. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data (Google NQ) confirm the validity of the analysis. They further demonstrate that assigning greater redundancy to critical features effectively reduces the error rate, highlighting the effectiveness of semantic-aware feature encoding in error-prone communication settings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Bi-Directional Channel Reciprocity for Robust Ultra-Low-Rate Implicit CSI Feedback with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based implicit channel state information (CSI) feedback has been introduced to enhance spectral efficiency in massive MIMO systems. Existing methods often show performance degradation in ultra-low-rate scenarios and inadaptability across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose Dual-ImRUNet, an efficient uplink-assisted deep implicit CSI feedback framework incorporating two novel plug-in preprocessing modules to achieve ultra-low feedback rates while maintaining high environmental robustness. First, a novel bi-directional correlation enhancement module is proposed to strengthen the correlation between uplink and downlink CSI eigenvector matrices. This module projects highly correlated uplink and downlink channel matrices into their respective eigenspaces, effectively reducing redundancy for ultra-low-rate feedback. Second, an innovative input format alignment module is designed to maintain consistent data distributions at both encoder and decoder sides without extra transmission overhead, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental variations. Finally, we develop an efficient transformer-based implicit CSI feedback network to exploit angular-delay domain sparsity and bi-directional correlation for ultra-low-rate CSI compression. Simulation results demonstrate successful reduction of the feedback overhead by 85% compared with the state-of-the-art method and robustness against unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF) in a wireless line-of-sight channel comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveil key system-level insights. A comparison of the proposed method with the singular value decomposition-based method is illustrated to validate the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.10455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computational and statistical consequences of problem geometry in stochastic and online optimization. By focusing on constraint set and gradient geometry, we characterize the problem families for which stochastic- and adaptive-gradient methods are (minimax) optimal and, conversely, when nonlinear updates -- such as those mirror descent employs -- are necessary for optimal convergence. When the constraint set is quadratically convex, diagonally pre-conditioned stochastic gradient methods are minimax optimal. We provide quantitative converses showing that the ``distance'' of the underlying constraints from quadratic convexity determines the sub-optimality of subgradient methods. These results apply, for example, to any $\ell_p$-ball for $p &lt; 2$, and the computation/accuracy tradeoffs they demonstrate exhibit a striking analogy to those in Gaussian sequence models.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms and Implementations for Computing the Minimum Distance of Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on shared-memory parallel architectures.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Convergent Algorithm for Computing the Petz-Augustin Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the Petz-Augustin mean of order $\alpha \in (0,1) \cup (1,\infty)$, defined as the minimizer of a weighted sum of $n$ Petz-R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha$ over the set of $d$-by-$d$ quantum states, where the Petz-R\'enyi divergence is a quantum generalization of the classical R\'enyi divergence. We propose the first algorithm with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for solving this optimization problem. The iterates are guaranteed to converge to the Petz-Augustin mean at a linear rate of \( O\left( \lvert 1 - 1/\alpha \rvert^T \right) \) with respect to the Thompson metric for $\alpha\in(1/2,1)\cup(1,\infty)$, where \( T \) denotes the number of iterations. The algorithm has an initialization time complexity of $O\left(nd^3\right)$ and a per-iteration time complexity of $O\left(nd^2 + d^3\right)$.
  Two applications follow. First, we propose the first iterative method with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for computing the Petz capacity of order $\alpha\in(1/2,1)$, which generalizes the quantum channel capacity and characterizes the optimal error exponent in classical-quantum channel coding. Second, we establish that the Petz-Augustin mean of order $\alpha$, when all quantum states commute, is equivalent to the equilibrium prices in Fisher markets with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utilities of common elasticity $\rho=1-1/\alpha$, and our proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a t\^{a}tonnement dynamic. We then extend the proposed algorithm to inhomogeneous Fisher markets, where buyers have different elasticities, and prove that it achieves a faster convergence rate compared to existing t\^{a}tonnement-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Cryptanalytic Time-Space Lower Bounds via a Shearer-like Inequality for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time.
  Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.
  We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element).
  We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems.
  To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.</description>

      <title>Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets--specific subgraph structures in the Tanner graph--and indicate that identifying and avoiding such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.</description>
