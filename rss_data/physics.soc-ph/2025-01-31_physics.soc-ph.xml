      <title>An iterative spectral algorithm for digraph clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis with applications in many different fields. While there is a large body of work on clustering undirected graphs, the problem of clustering directed graphs is much less understood. The analysis is more complex in the directed graph case for two reasons: the clustering must preserve directional information in the relationships between clusters, and directed graphs have non-Hermitian adjacency matrices whose properties are less conducive to traditional spectral methods. Here we consider the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a directed graph into $k\ge 2$ clusters so that edges between different clusters tend to follow the same direction. We present an iterative algorithm based on spectral methods applied to new Hermitian representations of directed graphs. Our algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-art, both on synthetic and real-world data sets. Additionally, it is able to identify a "meta-graph" of $k$ vertices that represents the higher-order relations between clusters in a directed graph. We showcase this capability on data sets pertaining food webs, biological neural networks, and the online card game Hearthstone.</description>

      <title>Progress in Artificial Intelligence and its Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study long-run progress in artificial intelligence in a quantitative way. Many measures, including traditional ones such as patents and publications, machine learning benchmarks, and a new Aggregate State of the Art in ML (or ASOTA) Index we have constructed from these, show exponential growth at roughly constant rates over long periods. Production of patents and publications doubles every ten years, by contrast with the growth of computing resources driven by Moore's Law, roughly a doubling every two years. We argue that the input of AI researchers is also crucial and its contribution can be objectively estimated. Consequently, we give a simple argument that explains the 5:1 relation between these two rates. We then discuss the application of this argument to different output measures and compare our analyses with predictions based on machine learning scaling laws proposed in existing literature. Our quantitative framework facilitates understanding, predicting, and modulating the development of these important technologies.</description>

      <title>Modeling adaptive forward-looking behavior in epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating decision-making dynamics during an outbreak poses a challenge for epidemiology, faced by several modeling approaches siloed by different disciplines. We propose an epi-economic model where high-frequency choices of individuals respond to the infection dynamics over heterogeneous networks. Maintaining a rational forward-looking component to individual choices, agents follow a behavioral rule-of-thumb in the face of limited perceived forecasting precision in a highly uncertain epidemic environment. We describe the resulting equilibrium behavior of the epidemic by analytical expressions depending on the epidemic conditions. We study existence and welfare of equilibrium, identifying a fundamental negative externality. We also sign analytically the effects of the behavioral rule-of-thumb at different phases of the epidemic and characterize some comparative statics. Through numerical simulations, we contrast different information structures: global awareness -- where individuals only know the prevalence of the disease in the population -- with local awareness, where individuals know the prevalence in their neighborhood. We show that agents' behavioral response through forward-looking choice can flatten the epidemic curve, but local awareness, by triggering highly heterogeneous behavioral responses, more effectively curbs the disease compared to global awareness.</description>

      <title>Two universal pathways in demographic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demographic transition, characterized by declines in fertility and mortality, is a global phenomenon associated with modernization. While typical patterns of fertility decline are observed in Western countries, their applicability to other regions and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By analyzing demographic data from 195 countries over 200 years, this study identifies two universal pathways in the changes in the crude birth rate (i.e., births per 1,000 individuals {\lambda}) and life expectancy at birth ({e_0}), characterized by the conservation of either {\lambda e0} or {\lambda\exp(e_0/18)}. These pathways define two distinct phases governed by different mechanisms. Phase I, characterized by the conservation of {\lambda e_0}, dominated until the mid-20th century, with high child mortality and steady population growth. In contrast, Phase II, conserving {\lambda\exp(e_0/18)}, has prevailed since 1950, featuring low child mortality and steady GDP per capita growth. A theoretical model considering the trade-off between reproduction and education elucidates the transition between these phases, demonstrating that population size is prioritized in Phase I, while productivity is maximized in Phase II. Modernization processes, such as declining educational costs and increasing social mobility, are identified as key accelerators of the transition to Phase II. The findings suggest that reducing educational costs can foster fertility recovery without compromising educational standards, offering potential policy interventions. This study provides a novel theoretical framework for understanding demographic transition by applying principles from statistical physics to uncover universal macroscopic laws and their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Universal spatial inflation of human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility patterns reflect our interactions with the environment. While extensive research has focused on specific spatial scales -- such as intracity or intercity -- universal mobility characteristics across various scales remain largely unexplored. Here, by partitioning trajectories into modules through network community detection, we find that the geospatial extent of modules increases sublinearly with distance from home, indicating a universal inflation law that holds across three orders of magnitude and is independent of demographic factors. Our further investigation highlights a potential connection between this inflation law and hierarchical urban structure. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics, with implications for urban planning, tourism management, and epidemic intervention.</description>

      <title>Why Honor Heroes? The emergence of extreme altruistic behavior as a by-product of praisers' self-promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heroes are people who perform costly altruistic acts. Few people turn out to be heroes, but many spontaneously honor heroes by commenting, applauding, or enthusiastically celebrating their deeds. The existence of a praising audience leads individuals to compete to attract the crowd's admiration. The outcome is a winner-take-all situation in which only one or a few individuals engage in extreme altruistic behavior. The more difficult part is to explain the crowd's propensity to pay tribute from an individual fitness optimization perspective. The model proposed here shows how heroic behavior and its celebration by a large audience may emerge together. This situation is possible if admirers use public praise as a social signal to promote their own commitment to the values displayed by the hero.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hegselmann--Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann--Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann--Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann--Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann--Krause model.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local communities are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</description>
