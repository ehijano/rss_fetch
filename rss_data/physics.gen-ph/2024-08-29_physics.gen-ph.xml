      <title>A Role of Fractional Dimension in Study Physics</title>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the field of physics through the lens of fractional dimensionality. We propose that space is not confined to integer dimensions alone but can also be understood as a superposition of spaces that exist between these integer dimensions. The concept of fractional dimensional space arises from the idea that the space between integer dimensions is filled, which occurs through the application of a fractional derivative operator (the local part) that rotates the integer dimension to encompass all spaces between two integers. We introduce five foundational axioms that provide a mathematical framework for studying physics from this fractional dimensional perspective. To illustrate the framework's utility, we present three scenarios: static systems, linear trajectories, and quadratic trajectories. In this context, motion along linear or quadratic trajectories within a fractional dimensional space corresponds to an inertial reference frame or an accelerated system, respectively, in classical physics. Moreover, we propose that the coupling of space and time, commonly referred to as space-time, is better understood as space-dimension-time within this framework, where the dimension serves as an interconnecting platform. Finally, we derive the wave equation from the perspective of fractional dimensions, focusing on linear trajectories in fractional dimensional space. This approach provides new insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves in both lossless and lossy media, and it offers a fresh interpretation of the Doppler effect and gravitational redshift (or blueshift) phenomena from the standpoint of fractional dimensionality.</description>
