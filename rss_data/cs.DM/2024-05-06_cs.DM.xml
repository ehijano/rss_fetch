      <title>The Birkhoff completion of finite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Birkhoff completion as the smallest distributive lattice in which a given finite lattice can be embedded as semi-lattice. We discuss its relationship to implicational theories, in particular to R. Wille's simply-implicational theories. By an example, we show how the Birkhoff completion can be used as a tool for ordinal data science.</description>

      <title>The number of random 2-SAT solutions is asymptotically log-normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that throughout the satisfiable phase, the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments of a random 2-SAT formula satisfies a central limit theorem. This implies that the log of the number of satisfying assignments exhibits fluctuations of order $\sqrt n$, with $n$ the number of variables. The formula for the variance can be evaluated effectively. By contrast, for numerous other random constraint satisfaction problems the typical fluctuations of the logarithm of the number of solutions are {\em bounded} throughout all or most of the satisfiable regime.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Rings and Families of Almost Perfect Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De Bruijn tori, also called perfect maps, are two-dimensional periodic arrays of letters drawn from a given finite alphabet, such that each possible pattern of a given shape $(m,n)$ appears exactly once within one period of the torus. It is still unknown if de Bruijn tori of some certain size exist, like e.g. square shaped de Bruijn Tori with odd $m=n\in\{3,5,7\}$ and an even alphabet size $k$. However, in certain applications like positional coding, sub-perfect maps are sufficient, i.e. one does not need every possible $(m,n)$-pattern to appear, as long as a sufficient large number of such patterns is captured and every pattern occurs at most once. We show, that given any $m=n$ and a square alphabet size $k^2$, one can efficiently construct a sub-perfect map which is almost perfect, i.e. of almost maximal size. We do this by introducing de Bruijn rings, i.e. sub-perfect maps of minimal height, and providing an efficient construction method for them. We extend our results to non-square torus shapes and arbitrary non-prime alphabet sizes.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with covering number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>

      <title>Using finite automata to compute the base-$b$ representation of the golden ratio and other quadratic irrationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $n$'th digit of the base-$b$ representation of the golden ratio is a finite-state function of the Zeckendorf representation of $b^n$, and hence can be computed by a finite automaton. Similar results can be proven for any quadratic irrational. We use a satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove, in some cases, that the automata we construct are minimal.</description>

      <title>Matroid-reachability-based decomposition into arborescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of matroid-reachability-based packing of arborescences was solved by Kir\'aly. Here we solve the corresponding decomposition problem that turns out to be more complicated. The result is obtained from the solution of the more general problem of matroid-reachability-based $(\ell,\ell')$-limited packing of arborescences where we are given a lower bound $\ell$ and an upper bound $\ell'$ on the total number of arborescences in the packing. The problem is considered for branchings and in directed hypergraphs as well.</description>

      <title>Approximate Realizations for Outerplanaric Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of whether a sequence d = (d_1,d_2, \ldots, d_n) of positive integers is the degree sequence of some outerplanar (a.k.a. 1-page book embeddable) graph G. If so, G is an outerplanar realization of d and d is an outerplanaric sequence. The case where \sum d \leq 2n - 2 is easy, as d has a realization by a forest (which is trivially an outerplanar graph). In this paper, we consider the family \cD of all sequences d of even sum 2n\leq \sum d \le 4n-6-2\multipl_1, where \multipl_x is the number of x's in d. (The second inequality is a necessary condition for a sequence d with \sum d\geq 2n to be outerplanaric.) We partition \cD into two disjoint subfamilies, \cD=\cD_{NOP}\cup\cD_{2PBE}, such that every sequence in \cD_{NOP} is provably non-outerplanaric, and every sequence in \cD_{2PBE} is given a realizing graph $G$ enjoying a 2-page book embedding (and moreover, one of the pages is also bipartite).</description>

      <title>Non-detectable patterns hidden within sequences of bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct families of bit sequences using combinatorial methods. Each sequence is derived by con- verting a collection of numbers encoding certain combinatorial nu- merics from objects exhibiting symmetry in various dimensions. Using the algorithms first described in [1] we show that the NIST testing suite described in publication 800-22 does not detect these symmetries hidden within these sequences.</description>

      <title>Monotone Randomized Apportionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apportionment is the act of distributing the seats of a legislature among political parties (or states) in proportion to their vote shares (or populations). A famous impossibility by Balinski and Young (2001) shows that no apportionment method can be proportional up to one seat (quota) while also responding monotonically to changes in the votes (population monotonicity). Grimmett (2004) proposed to overcome this impossibility by randomizing the apportionment, which can achieve quota as well as perfect proportionality and monotonicity -- at least in terms of the expected number of seats awarded to each party. Still, the correlations between the seats awarded to different parties may exhibit bizarre non-monotonicities. When parties or voters care about joint events, such as whether a coalition of parties reaches a majority, these non-monotonicities can cause paradoxes, including incentives for strategic voting.
  In this paper, we propose monotonicity axioms ruling out these paradoxes, and study which of them can be satisfied jointly with Grimmett's axioms. Essentially, we require that, if a set of parties all receive more votes, the probability of those parties jointly receiving more seats should increase. Our work draws on a rich literature on unequal probability sampling in statistics (studied as dependent randomized rounding in computer science). Our main result shows that a sampling scheme due to Sampford (1967) satisfies Grimmett's axioms and a notion of higher-order correlation monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Complexity Framework for Forbidden Subgraphs II: Edge Subdivision and the "H"-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed set ${\cal H}$ of graphs, a graph $G$ is ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free if $G$ does not contain any $H \in {\cal H}$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. A recently proposed framework gives a complete classification on ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graphs (for finite sets ${\cal H}$) for problems that are solvable in polynomial time on graph classes of bounded treewidth, NP-complete on subcubic graphs, and whose NP-hardness is preserved under edge subdivision. While a lot of problems satisfy these conditions, there are also many problems that do not satisfy all three conditions and for which the complexity in ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graphs is unknown. We study problems for which only the first two conditions of the framework hold (they are solvable in polynomial time on classes of bounded treewidth and NP-complete on subcubic graphs, but NP-hardness is not preserved under edge subdivision). In particular, we make inroads into the classification of the complexity of four such problems: Hamilton Cycle, $k$-Induced Disjoint Paths, $C_5$-Colouring and Star $3$-Colouring. Although we do not complete the classifications, we show that the boundary between polynomial time and NP-complete differs among our problems and also from problems that do satisfy all three conditions of the framework, in particular when we forbid certain subdivisions of the ``H''-graph (the graph that looks like the letter ``H''). Hence, we exhibit a rich complexity landscape among problems for ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graph classes.</description>

      <title>Ordinals and recursively defined functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, call a decreasing sequence $x_1&gt;x_2&gt;x_3&gt;\cdots$ $f$-bad if $f(x_1)&gt;f(x_2)&gt;f(x_3)&gt;\cdots$, and call the function $f$ "ordinal decreasing" if there exist no infinite $f$-bad sequences. We prove the following result, which generalizes results of Erickson et al. (2022) and Bufetov et al. (2024): Given ordinal decreasing functions $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k,s$ that are everywhere larger than $0$, define the recursive algorithm "$M(x)$: if $x&lt;0$ return $f(x)$, else return $g_1(-M(x-g_2(-M(x-\cdots-g_k(-M(x-s(x)))\cdots))))$". Then $M(x)$ halts and is ordinal decreasing for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
  More specifically, given an ordinal decreasing function $f$, denote by $o(f)$ the ordinal height of the root of the tree of $f$-bad sequences. Then we prove that, for $k\ge 2$, the function $M(x)$ defined by the above algorithm satisfies $o(M)\le\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma+o(s)+1)$, where $\gamma$ is the smallest ordinal such that $\max{\{o(s),o(f),o(g_1), \ldots, o(g_k)\}}&lt;\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Modelling reliability of reversible circuits with 2D second-order cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular automaton is a widely known model of both reversible and irreversible computations. The family of reversible second-order cellular automata considered in this work is appropriate both for construction of logic gates and analysis of damage distribution. The quantities such as formal dimension of damage patterns can be used only for rough estimation of consequences of particular faults and numerical experiments are provided for illustration of some subtleties. Such analysis demonstrates high sensitivity to errors from defects, lack of synchronization and too short intervals between signals.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>
