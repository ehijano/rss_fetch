      <title>Adaptive transitions in FitzHugh-Nagumo networks with Hebb-Oja coupling rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive coupling in networks of interacting neurons has gained recent attention due to the many applications both in biological and in artificial neural networks, where adaptive coupling or synaptic plasticity is considered as a key factor in learning processes. In the present study, we apply adaptive connectivity rules in networks of interacting FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. Adaptive coupling, here, is realized via Hebbian learning adjusted by the Oja rule to prevent the network link weights from growing without bounds. Numerical investigations demonstrate that during the adaptation process the FitzHugh-Nagumo network undergoes adaptive transitions realizing traveling waves, synchronized states and chimera states transiting through various multiplicities. These transitions become more evident when the time scales governing the coupling dynamics are much slower than the ones governing the nodal dynamics (nodal potentials). Namely, when the coupling time scales are slow, the network has the time to realize and demonstrate different synchronization regimes before reaching the final steady state. The transitions can be observed not only in the spacetime plots but also in the abrupt changes of the average coupling weights as the network evolves in time. Regarding the asymptotic coupling distributions, we show that the limiting average coupling strength follows an inverse power law with respect to the Oja parameter (also called "forgetting" parameter) which balances the learning growth. We also report abrupt transitions in the asymptotic coupling strengths when the parameter related to adaptive coupling crosses from fast to slow time scales. These findings are in line with previous studies on spiking neural networks.</description>

      <title>Families of localized modes of Bose-Einstein condensates enabled by incommensurate optical lattice and photon-atom interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a one-dimensional optical cavity under the combined action of an external potential and atom-cavity coupling with mutually incommensurate periods. Such configuration enables the localization of matter waves even in the absence of two-body interactions. We study families of localized modes within the mean-field approximation for red and blue detunings from atomic and cavity resonances in relatively shallow quasiperiodic lattices, beyond the validity of the tight-binding approximation. The parameter regimes supporting localization of atomic wave packets are identified. The system exhibits two types of bistability manifested as distinct photon numbers under otherwise identical conditions. One type arises from the coexistence of multiple families of localized modes, typical of conservative nonlinear systems, while the other stems from the multivalued dependence of the families on system parameters, characteristic of systems exhibiting hysteresis. BEC in a cavity may also display pseudodegeneracy, understood as the existence of two distinct atomic-density distributions corresponding to the same atomic and photon numbers (although different chemical potentials). The stability of the localized modes is analyzed. It is shown that, owing to the strong impact of long-range interactions on stability, a two-localized-mode configuration can operate as an XOR logic gate.</description>
