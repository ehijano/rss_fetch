      <title>Enhancing Code-Switching ASR Leveraging Non-Peaky CTC Loss and Deep Language Posterior Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching-where multilingual speakers alternately switch between languages during conversations-still poses significant challenges to end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems due to phenomena of both acoustic and semantic confusion. This issue arises because ASR systems struggle to handle the rapid alternation of languages effectively, which often leads to significant performance degradation. Our main contributions are at least threefold: First, we incorporate language identification (LID) information into several intermediate layers of the encoder, aiming to enrich output embeddings with more detailed language information. Secondly, through the novel application of language boundary alignment loss, the subsequent ASR modules are enabled to more effectively utilize the knowledge of internal language posteriors. Third, we explore the feasibility of using language posteriors to facilitate deep interaction between shared encoder and language-specific encoders. Through comprehensive experiments on the SEAME corpus, we have verified that our proposed method outperforms the prior-art method, disentangle based mixture-of-experts (D-MoE), further enhancing the acuity of the encoder to languages.</description>

      <title>CSSinger: End-to-End Chunkwise Streaming Singing Voice Synthesis System Based on Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) {aims} to generate singing voices {of high} fidelity and expressiveness. {Conventional SVS systems usually utilize} an acoustic model to transform a music score into acoustic features, {followed by a vocoder to reconstruct the} singing voice. It was recently shown that end-to-end modeling is effective in the fields of SVS and Text to Speech (TTS). In this work, we thus present a fully end-to-end SVS method together with a chunkwise streaming inference to address the latency issue for practical usages. Note that this is the first attempt to fully implement end-to-end streaming audio synthesis using latent representations in VAE. We have made specific improvements to enhance the performance of streaming SVS using latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves synthesized audio with high expressiveness and pitch accuracy in both streaming SVS and TTS tasks.</description>

      <title>Emotional Vietnamese Speech-Based Depression Diagnosis Using Dynamic Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent and serious mental health condition that negatively impacts your emotions, thoughts, actions, and overall perception of the world. It is complicated to determine whether a person is depressed due to the symptoms of depression not apparent. However, their voice can be one of the factor from which we can acknowledge signs of depression. People who are depressed express discomfort, sadness and they may speak slowly, trembly, and lose emotion in their voices. In this study, we proposed the Dynamic Convolutional Block Attention Module (Dynamic-CBAM) to utilized with in an Attention-GRU Network to classify the emotions by analyzing the audio signal of humans. Based on the results, we can diagnose which patients are depressed or prone to depression then so that treatment and prevention can be started as soon as possible. The research delves into the intricate computational steps involved in implementing a Attention-GRU deep learning architecture. Through experimentation, the model has achieved an impressive recognition with Unweighted Accuracy (UA) rate of 0.87 and 0.86 Weighted Accuracy (WA) rate and F1 rate of 0.87 in the VNEMOS dataset. Training code is released in https://github.com/fiyud/Emotional-Vietnamese-Speech-Based-Depression-Diagnosis-Using-Dynamic-Attention-Mechanism</description>

      <title>Complex-Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Model for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion model-based monaural speech enhancement method. Our approach incorporates the separate estimation of speech spectra's magnitude and phase in two diffusion networks. Throughout the diffusion process, noise clips from real-world noise interferences are added gradually to the clean speech spectra and a noise-aware reverse process is proposed to learn how to generate both clean speech spectra and noise spectra. Furthermore, to fully leverage the intrinsic relationship between magnitude and phase, we introduce a complex-cycle-consistent (CCC) mechanism that uses the estimated magnitude to map the phase, and vice versa. We implement this algorithm within a phase-aware speech enhancement diffusion model (SEDM). We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting the significant benefits of exploiting the intrinsic relationship between phase and magnitude information to enhance speech. The comparison to conventional diffusion models demonstrates the superiority of SEDM.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Graphic Notation with MusicLDM: An AI Improvisation of Cornelius Cardew's Treatise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel method for composing and improvising music inspired by Cornelius Cardew's Treatise, using AI to bridge graphic notation and musical expression. By leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT to interpret the abstract visual elements of Treatise, we convert these graphical images into descriptive textual prompts. These prompts are then input into MusicLDM, a pre-trained latent diffusion model designed for music generation. We introduce a technique called "outpainting," which overlaps sections of AI-generated music to create a seamless and cohesive composition. We demostrate a new perspective on performing and interpreting graphic scores, showing how AI can transform visual stimuli into sound and expand the creative possibilities in contemporary/experimental music composition. Musical pieces are available at https://bit.ly/TreatiseAI</description>

      <title>EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Speech-Forensics: Towards Comprehensive Synthetic Speech Dataset Establishment and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic from real speech is increasingly crucial due to the risks of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech, offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in this field.</description>

      <title>YingSound: Video-Guided Sound Effects Generation with Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for product-level videos, where only a small amount of labeled data is available for diverse scenes, requires the production of high-quality sounds in few-shot settings. To tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in real-world scenes, we introduce YingSound, a foundation model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports high-quality audio generation in few-shot settings. Specifically, YingSound consists of two major modules. The first module uses a conditional flow matching transformer to achieve effective semantic alignment in sound generation across audio and visual modalities. This module aims to build a learnable audio-visual aggregator (AVA) that integrates high-resolution visual features with corresponding audio features at multiple stages. The second module is developed with a proposed multi-modal visual-audio chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to generate finer sound effects in few-shot settings. Finally, an industry-standard video-to-audio (V2A) dataset that encompasses various real-world scenarios is presented. We show that YingSound effectively generates high-quality synchronized sounds across diverse conditional inputs through automated evaluations and human studies.

      <title>On the Generation and Removal of Speaker Adversarial Perturbation for Voice-Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are commonly known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks mounted through subtle perturbation on the input data. Recent development in voice-privacy protection has shown the positive use cases of the same technique to conceal speaker's voice attribute with additive perturbation signal generated by an adversarial network. This paper examines the reversibility property where an entity generating the adversarial perturbations is authorized to remove them and restore original speech (e.g., the speaker him/herself). A similar technique could also be used by an investigator to deanonymize a voice-protected speech to restore criminals' identities in security and forensic analysis. In this setting, the perturbation generative module is assumed to be known in the removal process. To this end, a joint training of perturbation generation and removal modules is proposed. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrated that the subtle perturbations added to the original speech can be predicted from the anonymized speech while achieving the goal of privacy protection. By removing these perturbations from the anonymized sample, the original speech can be restored. Audio samples can be found in \url{https://voiceprivacy.github.io/Perturbation-Generation-Removal/}.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Video and Audio Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the abundance of current researches working on the sentiment analysis from videos and audios, finding the best model that gives the highest accuracy rate is still considered a challenge for researchers in this field. The main objective of this paper is to prove the usability of emotion recognition models that take video and audio inputs. The datasets used to train the models are the CREMA-D dataset for audio and the RAVDESS dataset for video. The fine-tuned models that been used are: Facebook/wav2vec2-large for audio and the Google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400 for video. The avarage of the probabilities for each emotion generated by the two previous models is utilized in the decision making framework. After disparity in the results, if one of the models gets much higher accuracy, another test framework is created. The methods used are the Weighted Average method, the Confidence Level Threshold method, the Dynamic Weighting Based on Confidence method, and the Rule-Based Logic method. This limited approach gives encouraging results that make future research into these methods viable.</description>

      <title>Learned Compression for Compressed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc</description>

      <title>Multimodal Music Generation with Explicit Bridges and Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal music generation aims to produce music from diverse input modalities, including text, videos, and images. Existing methods use a common embedding space for multimodal fusion. Despite their effectiveness in other modalities, their application in multimodal music generation faces challenges of data scarcity, weak cross-modal alignment, and limited controllability. This paper addresses these issues by using explicit bridges of text and music for multimodal alignment. We introduce a novel method named Visuals Music Bridge (VMB). Specifically, a Multimodal Music Description Model converts visual inputs into detailed textual descriptions to provide the text bridge; a Dual-track Music Retrieval module that combines broad and targeted retrieval strategies to provide the music bridge and enable user control. Finally, we design an Explicitly Conditioned Music Generation framework to generate music based on the two bridges. We conduct experiments on video-to-music, image-to-music, text-to-music, and controllable music generation tasks, along with experiments on controllability. The results demonstrate that VMB significantly enhances music quality, modality, and customization alignment compared to previous methods. VMB sets a new standard for interpretable and expressive multimodal music generation with applications in various multimedia fields. Demos and code are available at https://github.com/wbs2788/VMB.</description>

      <title>Audios Don't Lie: Multi-Frequency Channel Attention Mechanism for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of deepfake technology in the audio field has gradually increased, resulting in a wide range of security risks. Especially in the financial and social security fields, the misuse of deepfake audios has raised serious concerns. To address this challenge, this study proposes an audio deepfake detection method based on multi-frequency channel attention mechanism (MFCA) and 2D discrete cosine transform (DCT). By processing the audio signal into a melspectrogram, using MobileNet V2 to extract deep features, and combining it with the MFCA module to weight different frequency channels in the audio signal, this method can effectively capture the fine-grained frequency domain features in the audio signal and enhance the Classification capability of fake audios. Experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the model proposed in this study shows significant advantages in accuracy, precision,recall, F1 score and other indicators. Especially in complex audio scenarios, this method shows stronger robustness and generalization capabilities and provides a new idea for audio deepfake detection and has important practical application value. In the future, more advanced audio detection technologies and optimization strategies will be explored to further improve the accuracy and generalization capabilities of audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Multi-scale Approach for Speech and Dynamics Synchrony in Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animating still face images with deep generative models using a speech input signal is an active research topic and has seen important recent progress.However, much of the effort has been put into lip syncing and rendering quality while the generation of natural head motion, let alone the audio-visual correlation between head motion and speech, has often been neglected.In this work, we propose a multi-scale audio-visual synchrony loss and a multi-scale autoregressive GAN to better handle short and long-term correlation between speech and the dynamics of the head and lips.In particular, we train a stack of syncer models on multimodal input pyramids and use these models as guidance in a multi-scale generator network to produce audio-aligned motion unfolding over diverse time scales.Both the pyramid of audio-visual syncers and the generative models are trained in a low-dimensional space that fully preserves dynamics cues.The experiments show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in head motion dynamics quality and especially in multi-scale audio-visual synchrony on a collection of benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbps when trained and tested on the EigenScape database. The model has potential applications for learning other types of content and multichannel formats.</description>

      <title>Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its "Nearly" Complete Omission of the Global South</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>EmoSpeech: A Corpus of Emotionally Rich and Contextually Detailed Speech Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06581</link>

Abstract: Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the quality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the target speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional expression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle emotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech databases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to capture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of emotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have focussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to describe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more emotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel process aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich speech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions through a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of the database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual annotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language models. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable solution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing emotionally controlled TTS systems.</description>

      <title>TouchTTS: An Embarrassingly Simple TTS Framework that Everyone Can Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08237</link>

Abstract: It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Training Data of Music Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) models are increasingly used to produce content across domains, including text, images, and audio. While these models represent a major technical breakthrough, they gain their generative capabilities from being trained on enormous amounts of human-generated content, which often includes copyrighted material. In this work, we investigate whether audio watermarking techniques can be used to detect an unauthorized usage of content to train a music generation model. We compare outputs generated by a model trained on watermarked data to a model trained on non-watermarked data. We study factors that impact the model's generation behaviour: the watermarking technique, the proportion of watermarked samples in the training set, and the robustness of the watermarking technique against the model's tokenizer. Our results show that audio watermarking techniques, including some that are imperceptible to humans, can lead to noticeable shifts in the model's outputs. We also study the robustness of a state-of-the-art watermarking technique to removal techniques.</description>
