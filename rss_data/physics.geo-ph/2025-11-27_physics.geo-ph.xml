      <title>Determination of new national highpoints of five African and Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Togo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not all nations on earth have previously been surveyed accurately enough to know for certain which peak is the national highpoint, the highest peak in the country. Knowledge of these peaks is important for understanding the physical geography of these countries in terms of natural resource availability, watershed management, and tourism potential. For this study, ground surveys were conducted between 2018-2025 with modern professional surveying equipment, including differential GPS units and Abney levels, to accurately determine the national highpoints in five African and Asian countries where uncertainty existed. New national highpoints were determined for Saudi Arabia (Jabal Ferwa), Uzbekistan (Alpomish), Gambia (Sare Firasu Hill), Guinea-Bissau (Mt Ronde), and Togo (Mt Atilakoutse). Elevations were measured with sub-meter vertical accuracy for candidate peaks in Saudi Arabia, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Togo. Relative elevations were measured between contender peaks in Uzbekistan with sufficient accuracy to determine the highpoint.</description>

      <title>When barchan dunes move over craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possible outcomes of a subaqueous barchan moving over a crater-like depression in the bed. For that, we carried out experiments where we varied the dune size, crater and grain diameters, and flow velocities. We found that subaqueous barchans can be blocked, destroyed, or pass over craters, with transitional situations, and that strong instabilities take place under some conditions. Based on a dune-crater size ratio and a modified Stokes number, we propose a map that classifies the different outcomes of interactions. If used with caution, the map can serve as a reference for understanding the much slower behavior of dunes migrating over or near craters on the surface of Mars.</description>

      <title>High resolution 3D imaging of diamonds with multiphoton microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamonds offer unique benefits for optical technology development due to their optical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. These attributes also contribute to their aesthetic appeal, high commercial value, and utility in geological studies. Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.</description>

      <title>Launching AoyuX: A 25-Year Pseudo-Prospective Earthquake Forecasting Experiment at the China Seismic Experimental Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast models in statistical seismology are commonly evaluated with log-likelihood scores of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake numbers, yet heavy tails and out-of-range observations can bias model ranking. We develop a tail-aware evaluation framework that estimates cell-wise P(n) using adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation and tests three strategies for handling out-of-range counts. Using the AoyuX platform, we perform a ~25-year month-by-month pseudo-prospective forecast experiment in the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES), comparing Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model with a homogeneous background (ETAS{\mu}) to a spatially heterogeneous variant (ETAS{\mu}(x,y)) across six spatial resolutions and five magnitude thresholds. Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) of counts per cell are well described by power laws with exponents a = 1.40 +- 0.21 across all settings. Using previous theoretical results, this provides a robust estimate of the productivity exponent, {\alpha} = 0.57 +- 0.08 using a b-value equal to 0.8, providing a valuable quantification of this key parameter in aftershock modeling. Model ranking is sensitive to how the tail of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake counts is treated: power law extrapolation is both theoretically justified and empirically the most robust. Cumulative information gain (CIG) shows that ETAS{\mu}(x,y) outperforms ETAS{\mu} in data-rich configurations, whereas in data-poor settings stochastic fluctuations dominate. A coefficient-of-variation analysis of per-window log-likelihood differences distinguishes genuine upward trends in CIG from noise-dominated fluctuations. By aligning a fat-tail-aware scoring methodology with an open testing platform, our work advances fair and statistically grounded assessment of earthquake forecasting models for the CSES and beyond.</description>

      <title>Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces heatwave intensity up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns-hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>
