      <title>Calculable Microscopic Theory for $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O Cross Section near Gamow Window II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic approach to the $^{12}$C$(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}$O radiative-capture reaction near the Gamow window has been proposed by Y. Suzuki, Few-Body Syst. {\bf 62}, 2 (2021). The important ingredients of the approach include the following: (1) The states of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O relevant to the reaction are described by fully microscopic 3\,$\alpha$-particle and 4\,$\alpha$-particle configurations. (2) The isovector electric dipole transition is accounted for through the isospin impurity of the constituent $\alpha$-particles. (3) The relative motion among the $\alpha$-particles is expanded in terms of correlated-Gaussian basis functions. A calculation of the radiative-capture cross section demands double angular-momentum projections, that is, the angular momentum of $^{12}$C consisting of 3 $\alpha$-particles and the orbital angular momentum for $^{12}$C$-\alpha$ relative motion. Advancing the previous formulation based on the single angular-momentum projection, I carry out the double projection and present all the formulas needed for the cross section calculation.</description>

      <title>Solving the Lindblad equation with methods from computational fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian dynamics describes the evolution of a density operator in closed quantum systems. One extension towards open quantum systems is provided by the Lindblad equation. It is applied to various systems and energy regimes in solid state physics as well as also in nuclear physics. A main challenge is that analytical solutions for the Lindblad equation are only obtained for harmonic system potentials or two-level systems. For other setups one has to rely on numerical methods.
  In this work, we propose to use a method from computational fluid dynamics, the Kurganov-Tadmor central (finite volume) scheme, to numerically solve the Lindblad equation in position-space representation. We will argue, that this method is advantageous in terms of the efficiency concerning initial conditions, discretization, and stability.
  On the one hand, we study, the applicability of this scheme by performing benchmark tests. Thereby we compare numerical results to analytic solutions and discuss aspects like boundary conditions, initial values, conserved quantities, and computational efficiency. On the other hand, we also comment on new qualitative insights to the Lindblad equation from its reformulation in terms of an advection-diffusion equation with source/sink terms.</description>

      <title>From Supernovae to Neutron Stars: A Systematic Approach to Axion Production at Finite Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of QCD axion production in environments with finite baryon density and temperature, implying significant changes to axion phenomenology. Within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, we derive the effective Lagrangian describing axion interactions with nucleons and mesons up to next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion. We focus on corrections to the axion-nucleon couplings from higher orders and finite density. These couplings are modified by up to an order of magnitude near nuclear saturation density, significantly impacting axion production in supernovae and neutron stars. Density-dependent corrections enhance the axion luminosity in supernovae by an order of magnitude, strengthening current best bounds by a factor of three. We stress the importance of including all axion production channels up to a given chiral order for a consistent luminosity calculation and classify the missing contributions up to the third chiral order. The modified axion-nucleon couplings also affect neutron star cooling rates via axion emission. A re-evaluation of existing neutron star cooling bounds, constrained to regions where perturbative control is reliable, weakens these bounds by a factor of four. Lastly, our results have implications for terrestrial axion searches that rely on precise knowledge of axion-nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future neutrino research program will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for Charge-Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) scattering, on the combination of "nucleon physics" expressed by form factors and "nuclear physics" expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. This talk presents a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas (CFG) Model for CCQE electron-nuclei and neutrino-nuclei scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Meson Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS and transition GPDs: A unified framework for spinless hadron case $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) extend the concept of hadron-to-resonance transition GPDs and provide a unified description of non-diagonal hard exclusive reactions in the generalized Bjorken limit. We present the formalism for the case of spinless hadrons addressing the non-diagonal deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^*\pi\to\gamma\pi\pi$ in terms of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs, which generalize GPDs for $\pi \to f_0, \, \rho, \, f_2, \, \cdots$ transitions. We work out the basic properties of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs and establish the soft pion theorems at the $2\pi$ production threshold. We construct the partial wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles and employ the dispersive approach to constrain $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of $\pi\pi$-scattering phases with help of the Omn\`{e}s representation. We estimate the $e^-\pi^+ \to e^- \gamma \pi^+ \pi^0$ cross section in the kinematics of the JLab@12 GeV incorporating the isolated $\rho(770)$ resonance state and work out the angular distributions of the cross section, specifying the observables sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars: Impacts of Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars have been well studied since they may be relevant to the physical interpretation of some of the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the magnetar giant flares. In the crustal region of a magnetar, the strong magnetic field can alter the equation of state and composition due to the Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion. In this paper, we study this effect on the crust-confined, torsional oscillation modes of neutron stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields in general relativity under the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, the inner and outer crusts are treated consistently based on the nuclear-energy density functional theory. Depending on the magnetic-field configurations, we find that the Landau-Rabi quantization of electrons can change the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillation mode of $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star models with a normal fluid core by about 10% when the magnetic field strength at the pole reaches the order of $10^{16}$ G. The shift can even approach 20% at a field strength of $10^{15}$ G for neutron stars with a simple model of superconducting core where the magnetic field is assumed to be expelled completely.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits containing only symmetry-respecting gates. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. These constraints typically include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while 2-qubit gates are semi-universal for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries in qubit systems, SU(d) symmetry with $d\ge 3$ requires 3-qudit gates for semi-universality. Failure of semi-universality precludes the distribution generated by the random circuits from being even a 2-design for the Haar distribution over symmetry-respecting unitaries. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions, satisfied by U(1) and SU(2) for example, the distribution becomes a $t$-design for $t$ growing polynomially with the number of qudits, where the degree is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum integer $t_{\max}$ for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a $t$-design for all $t\leq t_{\max}$. Notably, for U(1), SU(2) and cyclic groups, we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ as a function of the number of qubits and locality of the gates, and for SU(d), we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ for up to $4$-qudit gates.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>General theory of constructing potential with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory of potentials that support bound states at positive energies (bound states in the continuum). On the theoretical side, we prove that, for systems described by nonlocal potentials of the form $V(r,r')$, bound states at positive energies are as common as those at negative energies. At the same time, we show that a local potential of the form $V(r)$ rarely supports a positive energy bound state. On the practical side, we show how to construct a (naturally nonlocal) potential which supports an arbitrary normalizable state at an arbitrary positive energy. We demonstrate our theory with numerical examples both in momentum and coordinate spaces with emphasis on the important role played by nonlocal potentials. Finally, we discuss how to observe bound states at positive energies, and where to search for nonlocal potentials which may support them.</description>
