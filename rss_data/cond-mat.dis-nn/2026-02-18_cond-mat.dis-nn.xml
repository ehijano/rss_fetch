      <title>Phase Transitions in Neural Networks Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are strongly over-parameterized, often containing far more weights than required for their task. Although such redundancy can aid optimization, it leads to inefficient deployment and high computational cost, motivating model compression techniques. Among these, network pruning provides a clear and effective route to sparsity. We study pruning from a statistical-physics perspective, interpreting performance degradation under weight removal as a phase transition. Focusing on magnitude-based pruning with fine-tuning, we show that deep networks undergo a sharp transition from a cooperative, functional phase to a disordered phase with collapsed performance. This transition is characterized by scaling laws consistent with second-order critical behavior, with connectivity as the control parameter. Our findings suggest universal pruning-induced criticality across architectures and datasets. Finally, we show that there exists a large class of subnetworks sharing the same nodes' degrees with similar learning ability, thus linking model performance to its topological properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pontus--Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Quasiperiodic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how quasiperiodic spatial structure enables protocol-induced acceleration in open quantum systems by analyzing the Pontus-Mpemba effect in one-dimensional chains subject to Markovian dephasing. The dynamics are governed by a Lindblad superoperator that drives all initial states toward a maximally mixed infinite-temperature steady state, isolating dynamical mechanisms from static equilibrium properties. Considering two representative quasiperiodic models, namely a tight-binding chain with a mosaic potential and its extension with power-law long-range hopping, we show that a properly engineered two-step protocol, in which the system is first steered to a finite temperature intermediate state, yields a strictly shorter overall relaxation time than direct evolution from the same initial configuration. This protocol-induced acceleration persists for both initially localized and extended eigenstates and remains robust in the presence of long-range hopping. A Liouvillian spectral analysis reveals that the mechanism originates from a redistribution of spectral weight that suppresses overlap with the slowest decay modes, rather than from any modification of the decay spectrum itself. Our results establish quasiperiodic chains as a controlled setting for engineering relaxation pathways through Liouvillian spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Effects of quenched disorder in three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of uncorrelated quenched disorder to the phase diagram and continuous transitions of three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models. For this purpose, we consider two types of quenched disorder, associated with the sites and plaquettes of the cubic lattice. In both cases, for sufficiently weak disorder, the phase diagram remains similar to that of the pure system, showing two different phases (one of them being a topologically ordered phase), separated by two different continuous transition lines. However, the quenched disorder changes the universality classes of the critical behaviors along some of the transition lines. The random-plaquette disorder turns out to be relevant along the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge transition line, so the critical behaviors belong to the different random-plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge (RP${\mathbb Z}_2$G) universality class with length-scale exponent $\nu=\nu_{\rm rp}\approx 0.82$; on the other hand, it turns out to be irrelevant along the other Ising$^\times$ transition line (a variant of the Ising transitions with a gauge-dependent order parameter), leaving unchanged its asymptotic critical behaviors with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$. The random-site disorder leads to a substantially different scenario: it destabilizes the Ising$^\times$ critical behaviors of the pure model, changing them into those of the randomly-dilute Ising$^{\times}$ (RDI$^{\times}$) universality class with $\nu=\nu_{\rm rdi}\approx 0.68$, while the critical behaviors along the other ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge topological transition line remains stable, with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$.</description>

      <title>On the origin of in-gap states in amorphous Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localized states in the band gap of amorphous phase change alloys like Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ control the electrical conduction via the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. Understanding the origin of in-gap states and their evolution in time during aging of the glass is therefore important for the control of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices. Here, we use a machine learning interatomic potential to generate several models of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ whose electronic structure is then analyzed within density functional theory with a hybrid functional. A detailed statistical analysis of the structural motifs on which the in-gap states are localized, reveals that the vast majority of in-gap states involve wrong bonds (homopolar or Ge-Sb bonds) often accompanied by Ge in tetrahedral configurations or overcoordinated Ge and Sb atoms. Metadynamics simulations mimicking glass aging support the picture that structural relaxations lead to the depletion of in-gap states and then to an increase of resistance. The simulations thus provide important insights for the mitigation of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In systems with fast periodic driving, there are special subsets of (resonant) states, which behavior can be described with effective, time-independent Hamiltonian in a rotating reference frame. Here, we show that experimentally feasible system of ultracold bosonic atoms on a ring with rapidly oscillating scattering length can be used to simulate time-independent two-component atomic mixture with exotic, long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of feature learning in RNNs and DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($\mu$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.</description>

      <title>Correlated electronic states at a ferromagnetic oxide interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal tight-binding model for the electronic interface layer of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure with oxygen vacancies. In this model, the effective carriers are subject to oxygen vacancy induced magnetic impurities. Both the effects of random on-site potentials and Zeeman-like exchange interactions between correlated carriers and magnetic impurities are taken into account. By applying the combined coherent potential approximation (CPA) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for a ferromagnetic state, we uncover a disordered Fermi-liquid regime for the majority-spins and a low energy scale which controls the transport of the minority-spin carriers, both induced by the magnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Linking the pressure dependence of the structure and thermal stability to {\alpha}- and \b{eta}-relaxations in metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glasses derive their functional properties from complex relaxation dynamics that remain enigmatic under extreme conditions. While the temperature dependence of these relaxation processes is well-established, their behavior under high-pressure conditions remains poorly understood due to significant experimental difficulties. In this study, we employ cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the \b{eta}-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without significant density changes. Conversely, {\alpha}-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T/Tg,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermo-mechanical processing.</description>

      <title>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the top principal components spontaneously group the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.</description>

      <title>BEP: A Binary Error Propagation Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), which constrain both weights and activations to binary values, offer substantial reductions in computational complexity, memory footprint, and energy consumption. These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively. The proposed algorithm is released as an open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of the Sub-Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>
