      <title>Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn ``world models'' that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

      <title>CookingDiffusion: Cooking Procedural Image Generation with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation models have excelled in creating diverse and realistic images. This success extends to food imagery, where various conditional inputs like cooking styles, ingredients, and recipes are utilized. However, a yet-unexplored challenge is generating a sequence of procedural images based on cooking steps from a recipe. This could enhance the cooking experience with visual guidance and possibly lead to an intelligent cooking simulation system. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task called \textbf{cooking procedural image generation}. This task is inherently demanding, as it strives to create photo-realistic images that align with cooking steps while preserving sequential consistency. To collectively tackle these challenges, we present \textbf{CookingDiffusion}, a novel approach that leverages Stable Diffusion and three innovative Memory Nets to model procedural prompts. These prompts encompass text prompts (representing cooking steps), image prompts (corresponding to cooking images), and multi-modal prompts (mixing cooking steps and images), ensuring the consistent generation of cooking procedural images. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we preprocess the YouCookII dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model excels at generating high-quality cooking procedural images with remarkable consistency across sequential cooking steps, as measured by both the FID and the proposed Average Procedure Consistency metrics. Furthermore, CookingDiffusion demonstrates the ability to manipulate ingredients and cooking methods in a recipe. We will make our code, models, and dataset publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>NeurOp-Diff:Continuous Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Neural Operator Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most publicly accessible remote sensing data suffer from low resolution, limiting their practical applications. To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at https://github.com/zerono000/NeurOp-Diff.</description>

      <title>Creating Virtual Environments with 3D Gaussian Splatting: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an innovative and efficient 3D representation technique. While its potential for extended reality (XR) applications is frequently highlighted, its practical effectiveness remains underexplored. In this work, we examine three distinct 3DGS-based approaches for virtual environment (VE) creation, leveraging their unique strengths for efficient and visually compelling scene representation. By conducting a comparable study, we evaluate the feasibility of 3DGS in creating immersive VEs, identify its limitations in XR applications, and discuss future research and development opportunities.</description>

      <title>CaPa: Carve-n-Paint Synthesis for Efficient 4K Textured Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs has become a central objective in modern generative modeling. Despite the proliferation of 3D generation algorithms, they frequently grapple with challenges such as multi-view inconsistency, slow generation times, low fidelity, and surface reconstruction problems. While some studies have addressed some of these issues, a comprehensive solution remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CaPa}, a carve-and-paint framework that generates high-fidelity 3D assets efficiently. CaPa employs a two-stage process, decoupling geometry generation from texture synthesis. Initially, a 3D latent diffusion model generates geometry guided by multi-view inputs, ensuring structural consistency across perspectives. Subsequently, leveraging a novel, model-agnostic Spatially Decoupled Attention, the framework synthesizes high-resolution textures (up to 4K) for a given geometry. Furthermore, we propose a 3D-aware occlusion inpainting algorithm that fills untextured regions, resulting in cohesive results across the entire model. This pipeline generates high-quality 3D assets in less than 30 seconds, providing ready-to-use outputs for commercial applications. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPa excels in both texture fidelity and geometric stability, establishing a new standard for practical, scalable 3D asset generation.</description>

      <title>Sequential PatchCore: Anomaly Detection for Surface Inspection using Synthetic Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of surface impurities (e.g., water stains, fingerprints, stickers) is an often-mentioned issue that causes degradation of automated visual inspection systems. At the same time, synthetic data generation techniques for visual surface inspection have focused primarily on generating perfect examples and defects, disregarding impurities. This study highlights the importance of considering impurities when generating synthetic data. We introduce a procedural method to include photorealistic water stains in synthetic data. The synthetic datasets are generated to correspond to real datasets and are further used to train an anomaly detection model and investigate the influence of water stains. The high-resolution images used for surface inspection lead to memory bottlenecks during anomaly detection training. To address this, we introduce Sequential PatchCore - a method to build coresets sequentially and make training on large images using consumer-grade hardware tractable. This allows us to perform transfer learning using coresets pre-trained on different dataset versions. Our results show the benefits of using synthetic data for pre-training an explicit coreset anomaly model and the extended performance benefits of finetuning the coreset using real data. We observed how the impurities and labelling ambiguity lower the model performance and have additionally reported the defect-wise recall to provide an industrially relevant perspective on model performance.</description>

      <title>SynthLight: Portrait Relighting with Diffusion Model by Learning to Re-render Synthetic Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SynthLight, a diffusion model for portrait relighting. Our approach frames image relighting as a re-rendering problem, where pixels are transformed in response to changes in environmental lighting conditions. Using a physically-based rendering engine, we synthesize a dataset to simulate this lighting-conditioned transformation with 3D head assets under varying lighting. We propose two training and inference strategies to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real image domains: (1) multi-task training that takes advantage of real human portraits without lighting labels; (2) an inference time diffusion sampling procedure based on classifier-free guidance that leverages the input portrait to better preserve details. Our method generalizes to diverse real photographs and produces realistic illumination effects, including specular highlights and cast shadows, while preserving the subject's identity. Our quantitative experiments on Light Stage data demonstrate results comparable to state-of-the-art relighting methods. Our qualitative results on in-the-wild images showcase rich and unprecedented illumination effects. Project Page: \url{https://vrroom.github.io/synthlight/}</description>

      <title>Holoview: Interactive 3D visualization of medical data in AR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce HoloView, an innovative augmented reality (AR) system that enhances interactive learning of human anatomical structures through immersive visualization. Combining advanced rendering techniques with intuitive gesture-based interactions, HoloView provides a comprehensive technical solution for medical education. The system architecture features a distributed rendering pipeline that offloads stereoscopic computations to a remote server, optimizing performance and enabling high-quality visualization on less powerful devices. To prioritize visual quality in the user's direct line of sight while reducing computational load, we implement foveated rendering optimization, enhancing the immersive experience. Additionally, a hybrid surface-volume rendering technique is used to achieve faster rendering speeds without sacrificing visual fidelity. Complemented by a carefully designed user interface and gesture-based interaction system, HoloView allows users to naturally manipulate holographic content and seamlessly navigate the learning environment. HoloView significantly facilitates anatomical structure visualization and promotes an engaging, user-centric learning experience.</description>

      <title>Skinned Motion Retargeting with Dense Geometric Interaction Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing and maintaining geometric interactions among different body parts is crucial for successful motion retargeting in skinned characters. Existing approaches often overlook body geometries or add a geometry correction stage after skeletal motion retargeting. This results in conflicts between skeleton interaction and geometry correction, leading to issues such as jittery, interpenetration, and contact mismatches. To address these challenges, we introduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense geometric interactions in motion retargeting. Initially, we establish dense mesh correspondences between characters using semantically consistent sensors (SCS), effective across diverse mesh topologies. Subsequently, we develop a novel spatio-temporal representation called the dense mesh interaction (DMI) field. This field, a collection of interacting SCS feature vectors, skillfully captures both contact and non-contact interactions between body geometries. By aligning the DMI field during retargeting, MeshRet not only preserves motion semantics but also prevents self-interpenetration and ensures contact preservation. Extensive experiments on the public Mixamo dataset and our newly-collected ScanRet dataset demonstrate that MeshRet achieves state-of-the-art performance.
