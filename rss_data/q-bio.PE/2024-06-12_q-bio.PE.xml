      <title>Classical Myelo-Proliferative Neoplasms emergence and development based on real life incidence and mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling offers the opportunity to test hypothesis concerning Myeloproliferative emergence and development. We tested different mathematical models based on a training cohort (n=264 patients) (Registre de la c\^ote d'Or) to determine the emergence and evolution times before JAK2V617F classical Myeloproliferative disorders (respectively Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocytemia) are diagnosed. We dissected the time before diagnosis as two main periods: the time from embryonic development for the JAK2V617F mutation to occur, not disappear and enter in proliferation, and a second time corresponding to the expansion of the clonal population until diagnosis. We demonstrate using progressively complexified models that the rate of active mutation occurrence is not constant and doesn't just rely on individual variability, but rather increases with age and takes a median time of 63.1+/-13 years. A contrario, the expansion time can be considered as constant: 8.8 years once the mutation has emerged. Results were validated in an external cohort (national FIMBANK Cohort, n=1248 patients). Analyzing JAK2V617F Essential Thrombocytema versus Polycythemia Vera, we noticed that the first period of time (rate of active homozygous mutation occurrence) for PV takes approximatively 1.5 years more than for ET to develop when the expansion time was quasi-similar. In conclusion, our multi-step approach and the ultimate time-dependent model of MPN emergence and development demonstrates that the emergence of a JAK2V617F mutation should be linked to an aging mechanism, and indicates a 8-9 years period of time to develop a full MPN.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in empirical mutualistic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual species may experience diverse outcomes, from prosperity to extinction, in an ecological community subject to external and internal variations. Despite the wealth of theoretical results derived from random matrix ensembles, a theoretical framework still remains to be developed to understand species-level dynamical heterogeneity within a given community, hampering real-world ecosystems' theoretical assessment and management. Here, we consider empirical plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, additionally including all-to-all intragroup competition, where species abundance evolves under a Lotka-Volterra-type equation. Setting the strengths of competition and mutualism to be uniform, we investigate how individual species persist or go extinct under varying the interaction strengths. By employing bifurcation theory in tandem with numerical continuation, we elucidate transcritical bifurcations underlying species extinction and demonstrate that the Hopf bifurcation of unfeasible equilibria and degenerate transcritical bifurcations give rise to multistability, i.e., the coexistence of multiple attracting feasible equilibria. These bifurcations allow us to partition the parameter space into different regimes, each with distinct sets of extinct species, offering insights into how interspecific interactions generate one or multiple extinction scenarios within an ecological network.</description>

      <title>A simple way to well-posedness in $H^{1}$ of a delay differential equation from cell biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of recent well-posedness results in the theory of delay differential equations for ordinary differential equations arXiv:2308.04730 to a generalized population model for stem cell maturation. The weak approach using Sobolev-spaces we take allows for a larger class of initial prehistories and makes checking the requirements for well-posedness of such a model considerably easier compared to previous approaches. In fact the present approach is a possible means to guarantee that the solution manifold is not empty, which is a necessary requirement for a $C^{1}$-approach to work.</description>

      <title>A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods and supertree methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>

      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of tree balance is crucial. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we minimize the selection of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks? Previous studies comparing the statistical power of indices in detecting trees deviating from the Yule model have been limited in scope, utilizing only a subset of indices and alternative tree models.
  This research expands upon the examination of index power, encompassing all established indices and a broader array of alternative models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. Instead, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>
