      <title>Orientation-Dependent Enhanced Ionization in Acetylene Revealed by Ultrafast Cross-Polarized Pulse Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orientation dependence of Enhanced Ionization (EI) during strong-field-driven nuclear motion in acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$). Here, we both initiate and probe molecular dynamics in acetylene with intense 6-fs cross-polarized pulse pairs, separated by a variable delay. Following multiple ionization by the first pulse, acetylene undergoes simultaneous elongation of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, enabling further ionization by the second pulse and the formation of a very highly charged state, [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$. At small inter-pulse delays ($&lt;$20 fs), this enhancement occurs when the molecule is aligned to the probe pulse. Conversely, at large delays ($&gt;$40 fs), formation of [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$ occurs when the molecule is aligned to the pump pulse. By analyzing the polarization and time dependence of sequentially ionized [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$, we resolve two distinct pathways that both contribute to a large increase in the multiple ionization yield. This cross-polarized pulse pair scheme uniquely enables selective probing of deeply bound orbitals, providing new insights on orientation-dependent EI in highly charged hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which encodes optimization problems on graphs with arbitrary connectivity into Rydberg atom arrays. Here, a graph vertex is represented by a wire of atoms, and the (crossing) crossing-with-edge gadget is placed at the intersection of two wires to (de)couple their degrees of freedom and reproduce the graph connectivity. We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.</description>

      <title>Many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in a self-induced Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the motion of photoionized charge particles in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electomagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, where the strong Rydberg atom interaction competes with the internal driving from flying charges, and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase. Our work fills the experimental gap in the understanding the relation of multistability and dissipative discrete time crystalline phase. In this regard, it constitutes a highly controlled platform for exploring exotic nonequilibrium physics in dissipative interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Internal state cooling of an atom with thermal light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A near-minimal instance of optical cooling is experimentally presented wherein the internal-state entropy of a single atom is reduced more than twofold by illuminating it with broadband, incoherent light. Since the rate of optical pumping by a thermal state increases monotonically with its temperature, the cooling power in this scenario increases with higher thermal occupation, an example of a phenomenon known as cooling by heating. In contrast to optical pumping by coherent, narrow-band laser light, here we perform the same task with fiber-coupled, broadband sunlight, the brightest laboratory-accessible source of continuous blackbody radiation.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Halo Trimer in an Ultracold Bose-Fermi Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of three interacting particles gives rise to interesting universal phenomena, such as the staircase of Efimov trimers predicted in the context of nuclear physics and observed in ultracold gases. Here, we observe a novel type of halo trimer using radiofrequency spectroscopy in an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K atoms. The trimers consist of two light bosons and one heavy fermion, and have the structure of a Feshbach dimer weakly bound to one additional boson. We find that the trimer peak closely follows the dimer resonance over the entire range of explored interaction strengths across an order of magnitude variation of the dimer energy, as reproduced by our theoretical analysis. The presence of this halo trimer is of direct relevance for many-body physics in ultracold mixtures and the association of ultracold molecules.</description>

      <title>Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D arrays of matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atom interferometery is an exquisite measurement technique sensitive to inertial forces. However, it is commonly limited to a single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or post-corrected measurements. We report on a novel method for multi-axis inertial sensing based on the correlation of simultaneous light-pulse atom interferometers in 2D array arrangements of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). Deploying a scalable 3 x 3 BEC array spanning 1.6 mm^2 created using time-averaged optical potentials, we perform measurements of linear acceleration induced by gravity and simultaneously demonstrate sensitivity to angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as gravity gradients and higher-order derivatives. Our work enables simple, high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing compatible with high rotation rates, e.g., for inertial navigation in dynamic environments. We finally envision further applications of our method, e.g., 3D in-situ measurements and reconstruction of laser beam intensities and wave fronts.</description>

      <title>Domain formation and structural stabilities in mixed-species Coulomb crystals induced by sympathetically cooled highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in high-precision spectroscopy and frequency metrology for fundamental studies using sympathetically cooled highly charged ions (HCIs) embedded in Coulomb crystals of laser-cooled ions. In order to understand how their strong repulsion affects the crystal structure and dynamics, we study the thermal motion and rearrangement of small mixed linear and homogeneous crystals by both measurements and simulations. Co-crystallized HCIs form superlattices and divide the crystal into domains, where different reordering rates, melting points and localized phase transitions are observed due to decoupling of motional modes across boundaries. These results improve our understanding of homogeneous and inhomogeneous ion strings over a wide range of charge-to-mass ratios. This allows us to test our own simulations of the dynamic behavior of ion strings and gives us confidence in their suitability for applications related to quantum simulation as well as computing and the search for new physics.</description>

      <title>Collective coupling of driven multilevel atoms and its effect on four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopic models based on multilevel atoms are central to optimizing non-linear optical responses and the coherent control of light. These models are traditionally based on single-atom effects that are parametrically extrapolated to include collective effects, such as an enhanced response or propagation within atomic media. In this work we present a systematic analysis of the cooperative effects arising in driven systems composed of multilevel atoms coupled via a common electromagnetic environment. The analysis is based on an interplay between dressed states induced by the driving field and photon exchanges, and collective decay channels. This theory is applied to the case of four-wave mixing induced by a pair of lasers acting on an atomic pair with internal levels in the diamond configuration. The effect of inter-atomic correlations and collective decay over the photons created in this nonlinear process is then explored.
  The dependence of single and two-photon correlations are studied in detail for each region by varying atomic orientations and laser parameters { consistent with current experiments involving atomic gases.}Photonic correlation functions are shown to exhibit a transition from a Lorentz-like dependence on the two-photon detuning -- with general features that can be obtained in an isolated atom scheme -- to a two-peaked distribution when the dipole-dipole interactions become relevant. For weak Rabi frequencies whose value is smaller than the highest collective decay rate, the atoms are trapped inside their ground state as they approach each other. It is found that the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interaction and its wave nature are essential to understand the behavior of the photons correlations. Signatures of these processes are identified for existing experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Improved precision and accuracy of electron energy-loss spectroscopy quantification via fine structure fitting with constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>
