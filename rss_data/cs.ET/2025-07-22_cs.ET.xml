      <title>Privacy-Preserving Drone Navigation Through Homomorphic Encryption for Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As drones increasingly deliver packages in neighborhoods, concerns about collisions arise. One solution is to share flight paths within a specific zip code, but this compromises business privacy by revealing delivery routes. For example, it could disclose which stores send packages to certain addresses. To avoid exposing path information, we propose using homomorphic encryption-based comparison to compute path intersections. This allows drones to identify potential collisions without revealing path and destination details, allowing them to adjust altitude to avoid crashes. We implemented and tested our approach on resource-limited virtual machines to mimic the computational power of drones. Our results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster and requires less network communication compared to a garbled circuit-based approach. We also provide a security analysis of the approach against potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Design of an Edge-based Portable EHR System for Anemia Screening in Remote Health Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Lunar Communication through Inter-domain Space Networks and Dynamic Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reawakened era of lunar exploration is defined by a strategic shift from temporary visits to a sustained international and commercial presence, resulting in an unprecedented demand for a robust and continuously available communication infrastructure. The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin$-$a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Dot Product Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presents an inverse-designed optical cavity that can direct light from two sources such that if the sources were to represent any number in the range [-1,1] with magnitude encoded through the power emitted by the source and sign by switching the direction of source current, the photocurrent generated at the two output ports is proportional to the product of the two numbers. Let us say that the two sources encode x and y, which are two numbers $\in$ [-1,1]. Multiplication is reduced to the form $(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy \propto xy$. The addition and subtraction operations of the numbers are supported by constructive and destructive interference, respectively. The work shows that replacing the DDOT dot product engine of the Lightening Transformer with the optical cavity proposed to calculate the dot product can lead to a reduction in the area occupied by the photonic core by 88 \%, can reduce the power consumption by lasers by around 23.43 \%, and bring down energy consumption while training DeiT models by 0.88 \%. The cavities can generate photocurrents of the form $1.057 xy + 0.249$ with $R^2=0.88,$ thus showing a relationship of direct proportionality between the target product $xy$ and the output of the cavity in response to stimuli encoding $x$ and $y$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyshield: Quantum Key Distribution and Post-Quantum Authentication for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks in Adverse Skies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have emerged as a critical backbone for supporting the low-altitude economy, particularly with the densification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs). To meet growing data demands, some LAWN deployments incorporate free-space optical (FSO) links, which offer exceptional bandwidth and beam directivity. However, without strong security measures in place, both conventional radio frequency channels and FSO beams remain vulnerable to interception and spoofing and FSO in particular can suffer from turbulence, misalignment, and weather-related attenuation. To address these challenges in the quantum era, a quantum-secure architecture called Quantum Skyshield is proposed to enable reliable communication between the base transceiver station (BTS) and LAWN. The proposed design integrates BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) with post-quantum authentication mechanisms. Simulation results confirm the reliable generation of a 128-bit symmetric key when the quantum bit error rate (QBER) remains below the threshold of 11%. Authentication is enforced using Lamport one-time signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) to ensure message integrity. A Grover-inspired threat detection mechanism identifies anomalies with up to 89% probability in a single iteration, enabling real-time trust evaluation. Lastly, future research challenges have also been identified and discussed to guide further development in this area.</description>

      <title>Metaverse Security and Privacy Research: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of metaverse technologies, including virtual worlds, augmented reality, and lifelogging, has accelerated their adoption across diverse domains. This rise exposes users to significant new security and privacy challenges due to sociotechnical complexity, pervasive connectivity, and extensive user data collection in immersive environments. We present a systematic review of the literature published between 2013 and 2024, offering a comprehensive analysis of how the research community has addressed metaverse-related security and privacy issues over the past decade. We organize the studies by method, examined the security and privacy properties, immersive components, and evaluation strategies. Our investigation reveals a sharp increase in research activity in the last five years, a strong focus on practical and user-centered approaches, and a predominant use of benchmarking, human experimentation, and qualitative methods. Authentication and unobservability are the most frequently studied properties. However, critical gaps remain in areas such as policy compliance, accessibility, interoperability, and back-end infrastructure security. We emphasize the intertwined technical complexity and human factors of the metaverse and call for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to securing inclusive and trustworthy immersive environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Machine Learning: Applications in Feature Selection, Instance Selection, and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering. We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>One Step is Enough: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on One-Step Policy Optimization for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty. Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments. Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm, exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet, the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the number of served orders using simple MLP networks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Search via Recursive Oracle Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of $O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's $O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its applicability.</description>

      <title>Chemputer and Chemputation -- A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemputation reframes synthesis as the programmable execution of reaction code on a universally re-configurable hardware graph. Here we prove that a chemputer equipped with a finite, but extensible, set of reagents, catalysts and process conditions, together with a chempiler that maps reaction graphs onto hardware, is universal: it can generate any stable, isolable molecule in finite time and in analytically detectable quantity, provided real-time error correction keeps the per-step fidelity above the threshold set by the molecule's assembly index. The proof is constructed by casting the platform as a Chemical Synthesis Turing Machine (CSTM). The CSTM formalism supplies (i) an eight-tuple state definition that unifies reagents, process variables (including catalysts) and tape operations; (ii) the Universal Chemputation Principle; and (iii) a dynamic-error-correction routine ensuring fault tolerant execution. Linking this framework to assembly theory strengthens the definition of a molecule by demanding practical synthesizability and error correction becomes a prerequisite for universality. We validate the abstraction against &gt;100 \c{hi}DL programs executed on a modular chemputer rigs spanning single step to multi-step routes. Mapping each procedure onto CSTM shows that the cumulative number of unit operations grows linearly with synthetic depth. Together, these results elevate chemical synthesis to the status of a general computation: algorithms written in \c{hi}DL are compiled to hardware, executed with closed-loop correction, and produce verifiable molecular outputs. By formalising chemistry in this way, the chemputer offers a path to shareable, executable chemical code, interoperable hardware ecosystems, and ultimately a searchable, provable atlas of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.</description>

      <title>DiffCkt: A Diffusion Model-Based Hybrid Neural Network Framework for Automatic Transistor-Level Generation of Analog Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog circuit design consists of the pre-layout and layout phases. Among them, the pre-layout phase directly decides the final circuit performance, but heavily depends on experienced engineers to do manual design according to specific application scenarios. To overcome these challenges and automate the analog circuit pre-layout design phase, we introduce DiffCkt: a diffusion model-based hybrid neural network framework for the automatic transistor-level generation of analog circuits, which can directly generate corresponding circuit structures and device parameters tailored to specific performance requirements. To more accurately quantify the efficiency of circuits generated by DiffCkt, we introduce the Circuit Generation Efficiency Index (CGEI), which is determined by both the figure of merit (FOM) of a single generated circuit and the time consumed. Compared with relative research, DiffCkt has improved CGEI by a factor of $2.21 \sim 8365\times$, reaching a state-of-the-art (SOTA) level. In conclusion, this work shows that the diffusion model has the remarkable ability to learn and generate analog circuit structures and device parameters, providing a revolutionary method for automating the pre-layout design of analog circuits. The circuit dataset will be open source, its preview version is available at https://github.com/CjLiu-NJU/DiffCkt.</description>

      <title>Hedge Funds on a Swamp: Analyzing Patterns, Vulnerabilities, and Defense Measures in Blockchain Bridges</title>

Abstract: Blockchain bridges have become essential infrastructure for enabling interoperability across different blockchain networks, with more than $24B monthly bridge transaction volume. However, their growing adoption has been accompanied by a disproportionate rise in security breaches, making them the single largest source of financial loss in Web3. For cross-chain ecosystems to be robust and sustainable, it is essential to understand and address these vulnerabilities. In this study, we present a comprehensive systematization of blockchain bridge design and security. We define three bridge security priors, formalize the architectural structure of 13 prominent bridges, and identify 23 attack vectors grounded in real-world blockchain exploits. Using this foundation, we evaluate 43 representative attack scenarios and introduce a layered threat model that captures security failures across source chain, off-chain, and destination chain components.
  Our analysis at the static code and transaction network levels reveals recurring design flaws, particularly in access control, validator trust assumptions, and verification logic, and identifies key patterns in adversarial behavior based on transaction-level traces. To support future development, we propose a decision framework for bridge architecture design, along with defense mechanisms such as layered validation and circuit breakers. This work provides a data-driven foundation for evaluating bridge security and lays the groundwork for standardizing resilient cross-chain infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Regulating Next-Generation Implantable Brain-Computer Interfaces: Recommendations for Ethical Development and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice.</description>

      <title>"Before, I Asked My Mom, Now I Ask ChatGPT": Visual Privacy Management with Generative AI for Blind and Low-Vision People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21 participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation, indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction, privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of privacy and responsible handling of others data.</description>
