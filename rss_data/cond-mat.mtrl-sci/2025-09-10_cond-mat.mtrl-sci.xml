      <title>Record High Polarization at 2V and Imprint-free operation in Superlattice HfO2-ZrO2 by Proper Tuning of Ferro and Antiferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological intelligence, offers a pathway to revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) by unifying memory and processing in an energy-efficient, sustainable framework for data-intensive tasks. Ferroelectric (FE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for implementing artificial synapses, yet achieving low-voltage operation in CMOS back-end compatible devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that proper tuning of ferro and antiferroelectric phases in HfO2-ZrO2(HZO) superlattice based capacitors can lead to imprint-free switching with record switchable polarization (2Pr) of 76 micro Coulomb cm-2 under an external field of only 2 MV cm-1. The sizable remanent polarization of the superlattice HZO further enables linear potentiation and depression with an on to off ratio of 20 within a 3 MV cm-1 bias window. Under pulsed operation, the devices show robust endurance, either maintaining polarization with less than 10 per cent degradation up to 10^8 cycles or surviving beyond 10^9 cycles with recoverable fatigue. By elucidating two distinct fatigue mechanisms, this work highlights strategies for optimizing FE devices to meet the stringent demands of neuromorphic training applications.</description>

      <title>3D Mapping of Defects and Moir\'e Corrugations via Electron Ptychography Atomic Coordinate Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects and reconstructions in 2D moir\'e materials cause out-of-plane deformations which strongly modify their electronic properties but are difficult to experimentally access. Here, we solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models individually visualize each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies -- which lie exclusively in the outer Se planes. We also observe a new, unexpected type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending -- and breathing-type moir\'e-induced corrugations that should strongly impact the emergent electronic properties. Broadly, our methods generate 3D atom-by-atom models of a 2D heterointerface from data acquired in about 30 seconds, methods that should unlock routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems and catalyze design methods to control out-of-plane deformations.</description>

      <title>Computational and Experimental Investigation of Chiral and Achiral 2D Organic Lead Bromide Perovskites: Octahedral Distortions and Electronic and Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational investigation, in conjunction with synthesis and experimental characterization, into the structural, electronic, and optical properties of layered 2D organic lead bromide perovskites. We contrast materials based on the chiral (R/S)-4-fluoro-$\alpha$-methylbenzylammonium (R/S-FMBA), which have been shown to lead to bright room-temperature circularly polarized luminescence, with the similar achiral 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA). Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we study relaxed structures (compared with X-ray diffraction, XRD) and optical absorption spectra (compared with experiments), as well as bandstructure and orbital character of transitions. We develop and provide a Python code to calculate octahedral distortions and compare DFT and XRD results, finding that vdW corrections are important for accuracy and that DFT overestimates octahedral tilt angles. (FMBA)$_2$PbBr$_4$ shows among the largest tilt angle differences (often termed $\Delta \beta$) reported, $14^\circ$, indicating strong inversion symmetry-breaking which enables its chiral emission. The lowest-energy optical transitions involve the perovskite only and are polarized within the layer. This work furthers understanding of structure-property relations with applications to optoelectronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin oxide freestanding membranes with large-scale continuity and structural perfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding oxide membranes offer integration with advanced semiconductor platforms, unlocking opportunities for flexible electronics, silicon-based spintronics, neuromorphic computing, and high-performance energy technologies. Scalable fabrication of such membranes is essential for bridging fundamental discoveries in complex oxides with practical device deployment. However, the lateral dimensions of crack- and wrinkle-free membranes remain limited to millimeter scales, forming a critical bottleneck for large-area architectures. Overcoming this challenge demands strategies that preserve crystalline quality while suppressing defect transfer during release. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on a water-soluble sacrificial layer of super-tetragonal Sr4Al2O7, enabling the fabrication of ultrathin, crack-free, and wrinkle-free free-standing oxide membranes spanning centimeter-scale areas. This method is broadly applicable to a wide range of oxides and establishes a new pathway toward large-scale silicon integration and flexible oxide technologies. Nevertheless, dissolution of the sacrificial layer introduces oxygen vacancies into the SrRuO3 membranes, with diffusion depths reaching six unit cells, leading to anomalous "up-and-down" transport behavior. Although post-annealing can eliminate these vacancies, the required temperatures are incompatible with CMOS processes. Therefore, ultrathin freestanding membranes fabricated by water-assisted lift-off still face critical challenges for integration into miniaturized silicon-based oxide devices.</description>

      <title>Effective Atom Theory: Gradient-Driven ab initio Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Effective Atom Theory (EAT), a framework that transforms combinatorial materials design into a smooth, gradient-driven optimization within density functional theory (DFT). Atoms are represented as probabilistic mixtures of elements, enabling gradient-based optimizers to converge to a physically realizable material in about 50 energy evaluations -- far fewer than combinatorial optimization methods. Applied to Co-Cr-Ni-V oxides for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), EAT leads to a final recommended composition of Co0.19Cr0.06V0.31Ni0.44O.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathways in PbZrO$_3$ with Operando Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under a sufficiently high applied electric field, a non-polar antiferroelectric material, such as \ce{PbZrO3}, can undergo a rapid transformation to a polar ferroelectric phase. While this behavior is promising for energy storage and electromechanical applications, a complete understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the phase transition remain elusive. Here, we employ \textit{operando} scanning transmission electron microscopy electric field biasing to directly resolve the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in \ce{PbZrO3} thin films under device-relevant conditions. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a multi-step transition that includes several metastable phases. Complementary nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis further show that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a \quotes{dead layer} near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Taking advantage of this depth-dependent heterogeneity, dynamic phase transformations are observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases. At this dynamic transition front, repeated phase interconversion is shown to be driven by competing internal (due to substrate clamping and extended defects) and external fields, allowing the relative energies of intermediate phases to be compared as a function of electric field. This work highlights the critical role of local energetics in phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions, guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Anisotropy and Its Influence on Helium Bubble Nucleation, Growth, and Decohesion in Polycrystalline Iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accumulation of helium bubbles at grain boundaries (GBs) critically degrades the mechanical integrity of structural materials in nuclear reactors. While GBs act as sinks for radiation-induced defects, their inherent structural anisotropy leads to complex helium bubble evolution behaviors that remain poorly understood. This work integrates accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and a novel atomic-scale metric, the flexibility volume (V_f), to establish the interplay between GB character, helium segregation, and bubble growth mechanisms in body-centered cubic iron. We demonstrate that V_f, which incorporates both local atomic volume and vibrational properties, qualitatively predicts deformation propensity. Our results reveal that the atomic-scale segregation energy landscape dictates initial helium clustering and subsequent bubble morphology, with low-energy channels in tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary facilitating one-dimensional migration while isolated deep traps in twist {\Sigma}13 boundary promote larger, rounder bubble morphology. Critically, besides gradual bubble growth via trap mutation mechanism, we identify two distinct stress-relief mechanisms: loop punching in anisotropic tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary and interfacial decohesion in twist {\Sigma}11 boundary, with the dominant pathway determined by the interplay between bubble morphology and local mechanical softness. This study establishes a fundamental connection between GB crystallographic and energetical anisotropy and helium bubble evolution, providing critical insights for designing radiation-tolerant microstructures.</description>

      <title>Structural Phase Transition in CeMnSi under Pressure and Comparative Structural Properties of $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure up to $\sim$10 GPa were performed on tetragonal CeFeSi-type $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd). A structural phase transition was observed in CeMnSi at a critical pressure of $P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 5.7 GPa. In contrast, LaMnSi, PrMnSi, and NdMnSi do not exhibit any structural transitions within the same pressure range. The lattice parameter ratio $c/a$ of CeMnSi decreases rapidly as pressure approaches $P_{\rm s}$, whereas the $c/a$ ratios of the other $R$MnSi increase monotonically with pressure. CeMnSi also shows a relatively small bulk modulus: $B_0$ $\sim$ 41.4(4) GPa in the 0--2 GPa range and $B_0$ $\sim$ 32.8(2) GPa in the 4--5 GPa range, suggesting valence instability under pressure. The structural transition in CeMnSi is attributed to the pressure-induced decrease in $c/a$ and its low bulk modulus. Above $P_{\rm s}$, the X-ray diffraction pattern indicates a transition to a monoclinic structure with space group No. 11, $P2_1/m$. These findings highlight the unique pressure response of CeMnSi and provide insight into the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom in Ce-based intermetallic systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Dielectric Function of Calcium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium fluoride (fluorspar, CaF2 ) is of consummate importance for the manufacturing of optical components. In many cases, its wide transmission band eliminates the need for antireflective coatings. It is thus of interest to study its optical properties as a function of temperature. The optical properties are mainly determined by a strongly temperature-dependent infrared (IR) peak, and a series of nearly temperature-independent ultraviolet (UV) peaks. We find that the temperature dependence of the IR peak can be modeled, to good accuracy, by a radiation-reaction improved coupled-oscillator model, with temperature-dependent parameters. For the UV peaks, we find a convenient functional form which covers both the real as well as the imaginary parts of the dielectric function and provide a comparison to first-principles calculations. The result is a compact functional form for the dielectric function of undoped CaF2 in the frequency range 0 &lt; omega &lt; 1.8 a.u., and in the temperature range 22Celsius &lt; T &lt; 500Celsius. With the help of the temperature-dependent dielectric function, we obtain temperature-dependent values of the short-range and long-range asymptotics of atom-surface interactions with CaF2, for hydrogen, as well as ground-state and metastable helium.</description>

      <title>High-current p-type transistors from precursor-engineered synthetic monolayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a leading candidate for nanoscale complementary logic. However, high defect densities introduced during thin-film growth and device fabrication have limited p-type transistor performance. Here, we report a combined strategy of precursor-engineered chemical vapor deposition and damage-minimizing fabrication to overcome this limitation. By converting tungsten trioxide and residual oxyselenides into reactive suboxides before growth, and precisely regulating selenium delivery during deposition, we synthesize uniform, centimeter-scale monolayer WSe$_2$ films with charged defect densities as low as $5 \times 10^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$. Transistors fabricated from these films achieve record p-type on-state current up to $888 \mu$A$\cdot\mu$m$^{-1}$ at $V_{\mathrm{DS}}=-1$ V, matching leading n-type devices. This leap in material quality closes the p-type performance gap without exotic doping or contact materials, marking a critical step towards complementary two-dimensional semiconductor circuits.</description>

      <title>Alter-magnetic properties in the perovskite compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91 of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states, with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure, magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined time-reversal and rotation operation $\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect (ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr and Faraday effects.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Zeolite Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs, including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite screening workflows involving various compositions.</description>

      <title>Temperature behavior of optical absorption spectra in HfO2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnium dioxide, also known as hafnia, is an extremely sought-after material in opto- and nanoelectronics for creating optical coatings and various functional media to have stable performance characteristics under varying thermal operating conditions. In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of the optical properties of hafnia thin films exhibiting an amorphous structure in a wide temperature range of 7-296 K. For the first time we have examined the temperature effects in the energy gap of HfO2 films and estimated the effective phonon energy of 30 meV responsible for observed thermally assisted shift of electronic levels. It has been shown that the electron-phonon interaction in the oxygen subsystem predominantly causes the observed changes. The obtained refractive index values for the tested films are established to be compatible with independent predicted data and to decrease as the temperature drops. The energy structure and electron-phonon interaction features that have been found are critical for forecasting how hafnia-thin-film-based optoelectronic devices will behave across a wide temperature range.</description>

Abstract: The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of formic acid decomposition on single Pt atoms supported on heteroatom-doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formic acid is a promising liquid hydrogen carrier, but its catalytic decomposition requires both high activity and selectivity toward dehydrogenation. Here, we investigated the catalytic activity and selectivity of formic acid decomposition on single Pt atoms supported on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. Reaction energy profiles reveal that single Pt atoms on P- and O-doped graphene show catalytic activity comparable to Pt(111), while all systems maintain strong dehydrogenation selectivity. These findings highlight doped graphene as a promising support for reducing precious metal usage in dehydrogenation catalysts.</description>

      <title>Atomic Layer Etching of Aluminum Nitride: Mechanistic Insights from First-Principles Studies of Chlorine Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory calculations in combination with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, we investigated the adsorption, desorption, and diffusion of atomic chlorine and molecular chlorine on the Al terminated 0001 surface of aluminum nitride. Our results reveal that both atomic Cl and Cl2 exhibit a chemisorption character with high binding energies. Calculations revealed that the splitting pathway of Cl2 on the Al terminated AlN 0001 surface is a barrierless and exothermic process. These findings provide new microscopic-scale insights into halogen-insulator surface interactions and opportunities for new strategies in optimizing AlN atomic layer etching process in semiconductor fabrication.</description>

      <title>Dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes in polyvinyl butyral matrix for transparent ionic conductive films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop methods for increasing the dispersion degree of agglomerated multiwalled carbon nanotubes with subsequent introduction of them into polyvinyl butyral to create transparent conductive films. The influence of proton and a-proton solvents in combination with potassium triiodide (KI3) as a redox component for oxidation of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes surface, which reduces agglomeration due to electrostatic repulsion, is investigated. It is demonstrated that a-proton solvent cyclohexanone ensures a smaller size of the agglomerates (30-300 nm, with a maximum of ~145 nm) compared to proton solvent propyl alcohol (100-3000 nm, with a maximum of ~920 nm). The reduced aggregation is associated with the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups (C=O, C-O, C-O-C, and COO), which increase electrostatic stabilization. The impedance analysis showed that the constant component of the conductivity in the samples with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a-proton solvent shifts to frequencies of ~104 rad/s after the addition of the redox component, which indicates the formation of ion-conducting channels and stabilization of the jump charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Unusual magnetic order in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid-state compounds, the valence of europium can sometimes be mixed -- which is especially favored in structures with several positions for the europium atoms. In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states, resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures, below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$ K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by application of a modest external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>First-principles approach to ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study ultrafast exciton dynamics, revealing the underlying complex interactions on the electronic scale. Despite significant advances in experimental techniques, developing a comprehensive and rigorous theoretical framework for modeling and interpreting the transient response in photoexcited materials remains a challenge. Here, we present a first-principles approach to simulating pump-probe spectroscopy and disentangling the electronic and thermal contributions underlying exciton dynamics. We showcase our method to three materials, representative for different classes of solids: the transition-metal dichalcogenides WSe$_2$, the halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, and the transition-metal oxide TiO$_2$, showing remarkable agreement with experimental counterparts. We find that (i) photoinduced Coulomb screening is the primary electronic effect, responsible for a blue shift of exciton resonances, while (ii) Pauli blocking plays a minor role, and (iii) thermal lattice expansion leads to a red shift of the spectra. We further demonstrate how key parameters such as excitation density, pump photon energy, and pump polarization modulate the transient absorption spectra, offering direct control over the exciton-resonance energy. Our approach establishes a quantitative and predictive framework for interpreting pump-probe experiments, providing actionable insights for the design of energy-selective optoelectronic devices through exciton engineering.</description>

      <title>Investigation on Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Magnetic Properties of Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles Synthesized at Lower Annealing Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its multiferroic properties and narrow optical bandgap, Bismuth ferrite has been widely explored for spintronics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis applications. Bismuth ferrite can be synthesized in various forms like bulk, thin films, and nanostructures using various synthesis techniques. It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the volatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming this phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower annealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the annealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural and optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm the crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on structural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher temperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing with an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a strong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band gap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV for these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis performed using differential scanning calorimetry. Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles were weakly magnetic from the vibrating sample magnetometry analysis.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy: Doping overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit is an ongoing and significant area of research. In this study, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy using density functional theory calculations implemented via the Wien2k package. Our approach begins with a thorough structural optimization to determine the equilibrium lattice parameter and the atomic positions of the constituent elements within the unit cell of CoTiSi. Following this, we analyze the thermal transport properties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which allows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our calculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably higher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the enhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material, providing a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real device applications.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis of co-sputtered Cu-Nb and Cu-Pd textured thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural characterization of nanoscale-two-metal-phase systems, which exhibit partial, complete, or no mixing when co-sputtered with a few percent of a minority element, is extremely challenging. Co-sputtering two metals at room temperature results in frozen disorder within the deposited films. Distinguishing the contribution of each metal phase, determining the distribution and self-organization of the second constituent element within the lattice, accurately quantifying the extra element content, and assessing internal disorder through diffraction analysis are complex and require the development of a suitable model to fit diffraction patterns from various geometries. Here, we present a model to describe the structural distribution of alloy elements in magnetron-sputtered Cu thin films, exploring two contrasting cases: 1) with the mutually immiscible Nb and 2) with Pd, which has a negative heat of mixing with Cu, forming stable alloys. A comparison between X-ray diffraction data and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-derived elemental distribution is discussed.</description>

      <title>Selective band engineering of Bi/Si(111) by boron segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin layers of metals deposited on semiconductors display a variety of physical properties such as superconductivity, charge density waves, topological phases, strong spin-orbit (Rashba) splitting, among others. To access these exotic phases and induce new ones, it is necessary to control and tune the energies of the electronic states of those heterostructures. In this work we investigate the engineering of the band structure of the two-dimensional Bi/Si(111) $\beta$-phase using a modulation doping approach based on boron segregation at the surface. We demonstrate that the Bi-induced Rashba bands can be displaced in energy by up to 200 meV without altering their strong Rashba parameter. Importantly, while the Bi states shift upward, the underlying Si valence states remain essentially fixed, which rules out a simple band-bending scenario. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the displacement originates from changes in the hybridization of Si states near the surface, induced by the presence of B atoms. This selective mechanism halves the distance of the Rashba-split states from the Fermi level, opening the way to their exploitation in transport and spintronic devices and highlighting the broader potential of modulation doping as a band-engineering strategy for two-dimensional metals on semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetostriction as the origin of the magnetodielectric effect in La2CoMnO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic, elastic and dielectric properties in this material.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic differentiation for plane-wave DFT: materials design, error control and learning model parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Transmission Across Tilt Low-Angle Grain Boundaries in BCC Fe: The Role of Elastic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) are often regarded as penetrable interfaces to dislocation motion, yet recent studies suggest they can also act as strong barriers. The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly regarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission across various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission resistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the prevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions between lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling factor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB dislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such stresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as the dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing the strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively predicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation interactions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce decoratypes as a structure taxonomy that classifies compounds based on site decorations of specific structural prototypes. Building on this foundation, a ferroelectric materials discovery framework is developed, integrating decoratypes with an active learning approach to accelerate exploration. In addition, six novel ferroelectric candidates are predicted, including three strain-activated ferroelectrics and three strain-activated hyperferroelectrics. These findings highlight the potential of the decoratype taxonomy to enhance our understanding of structure-driven material properties and facilitate the discovery of promising yet underexplored regions of chemical space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that phonons coupled to electrons play an important role in both the fundamental phenomenology of electron spin resonance as well as the interpretation of such measurements. By including spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that the g-factor acquires emergent temperature dependencies that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, we predict that at low temperatures, the $g$-factor will exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the magnetic field, indicating a dynamic property that has not been previously considered in electron-phonon systems. We further predict the influence of phonons to be negligible at very low and very high temperatures, with the former requiring experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Innovative Oxide Transistor Satisfying Performance and Reliability Simultaneously by Understanding of Physics and Materials Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by a comprehensive analysis of accumulation mode transistor physics and oxide semiconductor materials properties, we demonstrate an innovative oxide semiconductor transistor structure and process flow that break the constraint between performance and reliability observed in conventional InGaZnO4 (IGZO) transistors. The newly proposed 10 nm innovative IGZO transistor features high on-current, high extrinsic mobility (20 cm2V-1s-1), near-zero hysteresis, and only 15 mV Vt shift after positive-bias-stress (PBS) of 3 MV/cm stress for 1000s at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of 1T$'$ and 1T CrS2 and Cr2S3 by MOCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only. Here we demonstrate a not yet reported crystal phase of CrS2 which is the distorted octahedral one (1T$'$) synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ CrS2, or 1T CrS2. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. The phases of CrS2 were uniquely identified also in contrast with Cr2S3 which was synthesized and characterized by a Neel temperature of ~46 K. Using magneto-optic Kerr imaging, the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this just predicated material. The 4DSTEM characterization reveals that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation process from the 1T to 1T$'$ resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals. Our MOCVD growth of complex and distorted phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.</description>

      <title>SAM$^{*}$: Task-Adaptive SAM with Physics-Guided Rewards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability. However, foundational models often present a considerable number of non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$, that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.</description>

      <title>PLaID++: A Preference Aligned Language Model for Targeted Inorganic Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO, achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Exciton Magnetic Moment: Interaction and Topological Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum phenomena and is emerging as a platform for quantum information science. Yet, the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in semiconductors, remains incomplete due to insufficient treatment of electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene, for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic resistivity of a $p$-wave magnet candidate CeNiAsO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain noncollinear antiferromagnets host momentum-dependent spin-splitting bands with odd-parity $p$-wave symmetry, termed $p$-wave magnets. Metallic $p$-wave magnets offer a unique platform for spintronic applications, yet experimental realizations remain scarce. CeNiAsO, featuring a tetragonal structure and developing a commensurate coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures, has been theoretically proposed as such a magnet. Here, we show that its resistivity exhibits strong two-fold in-plane anisotropy -- a key signature of its proposed $p$-wave magnetism. Reversible and nonvolatile switching between high- and low-resistance states is achieved by alternating the in-plane magnetic field direction, indicating potential for field-controlled memory devices. Our results not only provide critical experimental evidence for $p$-wave magnetism in CeNiAsO but also open new avenues for high-performance antiferromagnetic spintronics based on resistivity anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating from field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate materials properties in pulsed fields.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin current absorption in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic and highly-resistive non-magnetic layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is an intriguing spin-dependent transport phenomenon in bilayers consisting of non-magnetic and magnetic layers. Here, we report on the influence of longitudinal spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on SMR in bilayers composed of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB) and epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$, where SrIrO$_{3}$ is used as a highly-resistive spin current source. We observed a clear SMR signal and an enhancement in the SMR ratio with increasing CoFeB layer thickness, in qualitative agreement with an SMR model that incorporates the spin current absorption. The effective spin Hall angle is corrected from 0.07 to 0.12 with consideration of the spin current absorption, corresponding to a relative correction of ~71%. Our findings highlight the pronounced impact of the spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on the SMR mechanism when employing highly-resistive non-magnetic layer such as SrIrO$_{3}$, as well as other emerging quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Janus Skyrmion: Interfacial Quasiparticle with Two-Faced Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry, its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered magnetic layers.</description>

      <title>Physical origin of current-induced switching angle shift in magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-temperature growth of ultra thin NbTiN films on lithium niobate for integrated single photon detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar. Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Question of Information Content of EXAFS Spectra through a Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last several decades the Shannon-Nyquist criterion has been widely used as a measure of the maximum information content in EXAFS spectra and provided an upper limit on the number of parameters used in fitting data. However, the criterion implicitly assumes independent parameters which is never the case in EXAFS analysis. Here we introduce a new criterion to measure the information content in EXAFS based on Bayesian approach that lifts the above condition. We test the new criterion by fitting the EXAFS spectrum of liquid gallium and demonstrate that not only it does constitute a superior measure of the data information content, but can also provide guidance in data analysis to differentiate between various fitting strategies.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</description>

Abstract: Aging limits lithium-ion battery lifetime and must be understood to improve durability and performance, requiring a detailed understanding of how aging alters the availability of cyclable lithium and the integrity of active particles. In this work, (de)lithiation mechanisms are examined and spatially-resolved at the microscale in aged graphite electrodes dismounted from a large format graphite/LiFePO4-Li(NiCoAl)O2 cell at 70% remaining capacity. A multi-technique workflow is employed, combining electrochemical methods with post-mortem structural and morphological analyses, and introducing synchrotron microX-ray 2D diffraction imaging as a technique to probe aged graphite, applied at C-rates from C/5 to C. In-plane and through-plane heterogeneities in graphite dynamics are evidenced, showing the presence of inactive regions localized in two dimensions. In these areas, particles are either disconnected (irreversibly lost) or kinetically limited (reactivated at a slow C-rate), with dead or slow particles exhibiting a wide range of compositions, from x = 0 to x = 1 in LixC6. These inactivated graphite particles are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the depth of the aged negative electrode. In particular, the most inactivated region localizes at the negative electrode-separator interface, correlating to overworking graphite near the separator.</description>

      <title>Electronic Energy Scales of Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Operator Formalism for Noncollinear Functionals in Multicollinear Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced barocaloric performance in neopentyl plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants that have lower environmental impact than traditional vapour compression fluids. However, optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without diminishing parameters including the accessible latent heat. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with just 2% pentaerythritol to improve the phase transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change ($|\Delta S_{it,rev}|$ = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that the temperature range of the first-order phase transition is broadened because the intermolecular hydrogen bond network is disrupted by the presence of molecular dopants. Dynamic effects are revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering, which shows reduced activation energies for the molecular rotational modes underpinning the entropic component of the barocaloric effect. We propose that exploiting the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is an effective strategy for designing practicable molecular BCs.</description>

      <title>Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved strain measurements are crucial to understanding the properties of engineering materials. Although strain measurements utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction offer high spatial resolution, they are limited to surface or thin samples. X-ray diffraction methods, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging and X-ray topography, enable strain measurements deep inside bulk materials but face challenges in simultaneously achieving both high spatial resolution and large field-of-view. Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) offers a promising solution with its ability to image bulk crystals at the nanoscale while offering a field-of-view approaching a few hundred $\mu$m. However, an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in DFXM to the strain and lattice rotation tensors is lacking. In this paper, we develop such an inverse modeling formalism. Using the oblique diffraction geometry, enabling access to noncoplanar symmetry-equivalent reflections, we demonstrate that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible. We also develop the computational framework to both forward calculate the anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Finally, utilizing the established formalism and computational framework, we present methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific angles of DFXM. The developed sensitivity analysis also enables explicit computation of the errors associated with the reconstruction of each component. The formalism, the computational framework, and the sensitivity analysis established in this paper should assist both the interpretation of past DFXM experiments and the design of future DFXM experiments.</description>

Abstract: The magneto-optical transport of gapless type-I tilted single Weyl semimetals exhibits suppression of total magnetoconductivities in the presence of orbital magnetic moment(OMM) in linear and nonlinear responses (Yang Gao et al., Phys. Rev. B {\bf 105}, 165307 (2022)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate magnetoconductivities in gapless type-I tilted multi-Weyl semimetals(mWSMs) within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show the differences that arise compared to single-Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Scalable Sondheimer oscillations driven by commensurability between two quantizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of metallic crystals exhibits size effects when the electron mean free path exceeds the sample thickness. One such phenomenon, known as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field, have been hitherto treated with no reference to Landau quantization. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten oscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale that depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios and it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the cross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field $\frac{\partial A}{\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization to the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show that the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by fundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an inverted filling factor. Our conjecture is supported by the absence of such scaling in thin copper crystals.</description>

      <title>Metallic $p$-wave magnet with commensurate spin helix</title>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</description>

      <title>Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the $g$-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>
