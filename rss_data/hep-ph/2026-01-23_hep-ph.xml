      <title>Branching Ratios of $H_{1,2,3} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ in the Broken-Phase N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence from the ATLAS Collaboration for the rare decay $H \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ provides a unique window into the Higgs boson's coupling to second-generation fermions. In this work, we investigate how this signal can probe physics beyond the Standard Model by computing the branching ratios $B(H_{i} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ for the three CP-even Higgs bosons $H_{1,2,3}$ in the broken-phase Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM). We incorporate one-loop radiative corrections and analyze deviations from the Standard Model prediction due to modified Yukawa couplings, scalar mixing, and singlet--doublet interactions. By confronting our results with the ATLAS signal strength $\mu = 1.4 \pm 0.4$, we identify viable regions of the N2HDM parameter space, characterized by tan$\beta$, the singlet vacuum expectation value, and scalar masses, and assess the model's capacity to explain potential enhancements in the dimuon channel. Our study demonstrates that precision measurements of $H \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ serve as a powerful tool to test extended Higgs sectors and uncover new physics at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part I. Mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino--neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantumness at Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violations of classicality can be probed through measurements performed on a system at different times, as proposed by Leggett and Garg. Specifically, violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities suggest the presence of quantum effects in macroscopic systems. Long-baseline neutrino experiments provide some of the longest available propagation distances over which such tests can be performed. Previous studies of Leggett-Garg tests in the neutrino sector have largely focused on showing that the oscillation probabilities can violate classical bounds for certain parameter choices. In this work, we develop a more complete and data-driven framework that treats both the distributions representing the classical and quantum behavior, as well as the experimental uncertainties. We consider MINOS, T2K, NOvA, as well as the upcoming DUNE, and present the respective statistical significance for distinguishing quantum behavior from classical scenarios at these long-baseline neutrino experiments. Among them, we find that T2K yields the most significant violation of classicality, at the level of $\sim 14 \sigma$, with NOvA and projections for DUNE also resulting in a significance of more than $5\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Structure functions for the inclusive semileptonic $b$-quark decay at NNLO: a semi-analytic calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the inclusive charmless semileptonic $b$ decay, $b\to X_u\ell\bar{\nu}$ at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, with the primary aim of extracting the hadronic structure functions $W_i$ at NNLO. The analysis is based on a numerical calculation of the relevant kinematic distributions using a phase-space slicing method to handle infrared-sensitive contributions from real gluon emissions. We use known results from Heavy Quark Effective Theory and Soft-Collinear Effective Theory to extract the singular terms and construct a model for the regular contributions to the structure functions at NNLO, then perform a fit to the numerical results. We use our approximate structure functions to compute various kinematic distributions and moments: the comparison with existing analytic and numerical results shows very good agreement, which is further improved including the available analytic results in the fit.</description>

      <title>LHC Signatures of Neutral Scalar Cascades in the $Z_3$ symmetric 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the scalar sector is one of the standard approaches to exploring scenarios beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we examine the collider phenomenology of the Three Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) in the Type-Z or the democratic Yukawa interaction setup at the LHC. The scalar spectrum of the 3HDM includes three CP-even scalars, two CP-odd scalars, and four charged Higgs bosons. Focusing on cascade decay topologies, we investigate the collider signatures of the neutral scalars through the process $pp \rightarrow SV$, where $S$ is a neutral scalar and $V$ is a vector boson. We perform a cross-section analysis across multiple benchmark points that satisfy both theoretical and experimental constraints, considering two mass hierarchy scenarios: (i) Regular Hierarchy, where the SM-like Higgs is the lightest CP-even scalar, and (ii) Medial Hierarchy, featuring one Higgs boson lighter than the SM Higgs and one heavier. For both scenarios, we study the specific process $pp \rightarrow A \rightarrow HZ \rightarrow b \bar{b} l^+l^-$, performing a cut and count analysis at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. Our results demonstrate that while the Medial Hierarchy scenario allows discovery-level sensitivity for both the CP-even and CP-odd scalars, achieving the same sensitivity in the Regular Hierarchy setup necessitates substantially higher luminosity.</description>

      <title>Excluding Local Hidden Variables in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ Production: The Incompatibility with Angular-Momentum Conservation and CPT Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze spin entanglement in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs produced in the decays of scalar ($h$) and pseudoscalar ($a$) particles, contrasting predictions from quantum field theory (QFT) with those of local hidden-variable theories (LHVTs). Using the self-analyzing weak decays $\Lambda \to p\pi^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to \bar{p}\pi^+$, we derive the joint angular distributions within QFT. Our key findings are: For scalar production $h \to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, no LHVT respecting locality and angular-momentum conservation can reproduce the QFT distribution. For pseudoscalar production $a \to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, a CPT-symmetric LHVT is excluded by positivity constraints given the measured analyzing powers; however, if CPT symmetry is relaxed, an explicit LHVT construction, with uniform hidden-variable measure and response functions satisfying $b_1 c_1 = 3\alpha_{\Lambda}\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, can match the QFT result. These distinct signatures provide clear, experimentally testable criteria to discriminate between QFT and LHVT in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ systems across different production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Universal Formalism for Quantum Entanglement in Arbitrary Spin Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for probing quantum entanglement in the decay angular distributions of a spin-$S$ particle-antiparticle pair $A\bar{A}$, where each particle decays sequentially into a two-body final state, $A\to B+C$ and $\bar{A}\to\bar{B}+\bar{C}$, with $B(\bar{B})$ carrying spin $b$ and $C(\bar{C})$ being spinless. Starting from the most general polarized initial state, we derive the fully differential angular distribution $\mathcal{W}(\theta_1,\theta_2,\phi_1,\phi_2)$ and identify observables $\langle\cos(2S(\phi_1\mp\phi_2))\rangle$ whose expectation values directly depend on the entanglement-sensitive coefficients $\text{Re}\left(\alpha_{-S,\mp S}\alpha_{S,\pm S}^*\right)$ of the initial state. The proportionality factor $\mathcal{C}(S,b)$ in these relations is computed explicitly. For bosonic decays ($b=0,1,2,\ldots$), $\mathcal{C}(S,b)$ is universal and independent of decay dynamics; in particular, $\mathcal{C}(S,0)=1/2$ for any $S$, and $\mathcal{C}(1,1)=1/8$, matching known results for $W^+W^-$ decays. For fermionic decays ($b=\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2}\ldots$), $\mathcal{C}(S,b)$ depends explicitly on the spin analysis powers $\alpha_{A/\bar{A}}$, making entanglement extraction more decay-dependent. We further demonstrate, within the context of $e^+e^-\to\gamma^*\to A\bar{A}$ production, how $\alpha_{A/\bar{A}}$ can be determined experimentally using specific angular observables restricted to the beam-axis region. Our results highlight the special role of bosonic decays in providing clean, model-independent tests of quantum entanglement at colliders, while outlining a pathway for entanglement measurement in fermionic cases through supplementary polarization information.</description>

      <title>Two-loop rainbow neutrino masses in a non-invertible symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two-loop rainbow type of the neutrino mass model via ${Z}_2$ gauging of ${Z}_6$ non-invertible symmetry in which we introduce three families of isospin doublet vector-like fermions, heavy right-handed neutrinos and isospin doublet and singlet bosons. All new fields, which have nonzero charges under the non-invertible symmetry, can be dark matter candidates, since the non-invertible symmetry possesses a remnant ${Z}_2$ symmetry that plays a role in assuring the stability of our dark matter candidate. Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level. Thus, we consider our dark matter candidate in rather simpler co-annihilation system among their particles. Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology. Due to our dark matter nature, the sum of neutrino masses in case of normal hierarchy is larger than that in case of inverted hierarchy, which is opposite situation compared with typical active neutrino models.</description>

      <title>Decay Effect on Near-Threshold Mass Scaling with Complex and Coupled-Channel Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of decay channels on the near-threshold mass scaling by employing potential models. By varying the attractive strength of a square-well potential, we examine the pole trajectory associated with the transition of an $s$-wave bound state into a resonance state, incorporating decay-channel effects through both a single-channel complex potential model and a coupled-channel real potential model. As a result, we show that the pole of a quasibound state below the threshold is not continuously connected to that of a resonance state above the threshold. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from the single-channel and coupled-channel models, we clarify the correspondence between the pole trajectories in the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions from a Curci-Ferrari-based Polyakov loop potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We couple the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to a gluonic background corresponding to the gauge-field expectation value in the center-symmetric Landau gauge. Low-energy features in this gauge are captured by a center-symmetric extension of the Curci-Ferrari model and provide a good grasp on key aspects of the confinement/deconfinement transition. Within this framework, we can investigate the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions. Compared to other approaches based on multi-parameter Ans\"atze of the Polyakov loop potential fixed from comparison to finite-temperature lattice data, the modeling of the glue sector in the present set-up depends on only one phenomenological parameter that can be fixed by comparison to lattice data in the vacuum. We detail the structure of the phase diagram, with special emphasis on the finite density axis, and compute thermodynamical observables relevant for applications. We also highlight the properties of the recently introduced net quark number response of the medium as a sensible probe of the phases of QCD, in particular as a tool to disambiguate the nature of certain regions of the phase diagram where the use of the Polyakov loops could lead to misinterpretations. Finally, we critically assess the sensitivity of our results to the various parameters, both in the glue sector and in the chiral sector.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter from a Natural Discrete Gauge Symmetry in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of the Standard Model implies a natural $\mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete gauge symmetry. Cancellation of the corresponding Dai--Freed anomalies requires the introduction of three right-handed neutrinos and three additional Majorana fermions $\chi_i$. This gauge symmetry forbids the decay of the lightest fermion $\chi_1$ into Standard Model particles, rendering it automatically stable and providing a dark matter candidate without introducing an ad hoc stabilizing symmetry and domain-wall problem. The mass of $\chi_1$ is generated by the vacuum expectation value of a singlet scalar near the electroweak scale, naturally realizing a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) freeze-out scenario. Dark matter annihilation proceeds through scalar mediation, allowing the observed relic abundance to be reproduced while remaining consistent with current direct-detection constraints. It naturally realizes the secluded dark matter scenario and can be further tested in the next generation of experiments.</description>

      <title>Threshold corrections in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold corrections provide a universal link between experimentally measured broken-phase parameters and $\overline{\hbox{MS}}$ renormalised symmetric-phase parameters used in SMEFT renormalisation-group (RG) analyses and matching to new-physics models. In this work we compute in analytic form the complete set of one-loop threshold corrections in dimension-six SMEFT, using two electroweak input schemes and including tadpole effects in the Fleischer-Jegerlehner (FJ) scheme. As a by-product of the analysis, we obtain the full one-loop running of the strong coupling in SMEFT, including electroweak corrections, and the associated decoupling constants when the top quark and heavy electroweak bosons are integrated out. Although generally moderate, the loop-level dimension-six corrections can be enhanced through tadpole effects and top-quark loops, and can shift symmetric phase parameters at the 5% level under reasonable assumptions. Our results constitute a process-independent ingredient which can be readily implemented in public RG-running and matching codes in SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Induced Polarization Rotation in Active Galactic Nuclei Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parity-violating birefringence induced by an asymmetric neutrino background in plasmas associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $\omega \simeq \omega_p$, or when $E_\nu^{0}\simeq m_\nu \omega/\omega_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$\nu$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $\phi_{\rm d} \sim 10^{-35}\,\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies. Although the predicted rotation angles are below current polarimetric sensitivity, the identified spectral signatures provide a theoretical framework for probing neutrino asymmetries and AGN plasma properties independent of magnetic field models.</description>

      <title>Dominant Thermal Resonant Mechanism for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the importance of a new thermal resonant channel in the context of low-scale leptogenesis, which goes beyond the well-known mixing and oscillation of massive singlet neutrinos. This new channel is always present when considering the thermally-induced Higgs decay to leptons and relativistic sterile neutrinos, and can become dominant thanks to thermally-generated lepton-doublet flavour oscillations. This mechanism can yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe, even if there is no resonant enhancement from quasi-degenerate sterile neutrinos. The required active-to-sterile neutrino mixing differs from the other two low-scale leptogenesis channels and can be probed in fixed-target and long-lived particle experiments, and by displaced vertex searches at high-energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions are a well-motivated source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs), but most predictions are made based on the highly idealized model of perfectly spherical vacuum bubbles, neglecting thermal fluctuations. In this work we use $(3+1)$-dimensional lattice simulations of a scalar model with thermal initial conditions to quantify how thermal fluctuations distort bubble profiles and modify the resulting GW spectrum. We find that thermal fluctuations can strongly break spherical symmetry at early times, allowing even an isolated bubble to emit GWs. In multi-bubble simulations, thermal fluctuations systematically reshape the spectrum, suppressing the infrared part while enhancing and broadening the high-$k$ tail. We further provide an analytical estimate for the ultraviolet regime of the GW spectrum, which is in good agreement with our lattice results and suggests that this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations. These effects could leave observable imprints in future GW searches.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the complex Higgs triplet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the Higgs sector with an additional complex triplet field is often considered for generating the neutrino mass by the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Such an extension generally predicts $\rho\neq1$, where $\rho$ is the electroweak rho parameter at the tree level, so that the renormalization of the electroweak parameters is different from models like the standard model (SM) and two Higgs doublet models. In this paper, we present a full set of radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) in this model. One-loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons as well as SM fermions and gauge bosons to the decay rates of $h$ are calculated in the on-shell scheme. Gauge dependence appearing in the counter terms of mixing angles is eliminated by the pinch technique. Higher-order QCD corrections are also implemented. We find that the decay rates can significantly deviate from the predictions in the SM and other extensions such as the two Higgs doublet models and the singlet model. For example, the decay rates of $h\to WW^\ast$ and $h\to ZZ^\ast$ can be a few percent larger than the SM value under current experimental and theoretical constraints. In this case, deviations in $h\to \gamma\gamma$ and Higgs self-coupling can reach about $-20\%$ and $100\%$, respectively. The pattern of the deviations is different from the other extended Higgs models. These characteristic predictions are expected to be detected at the High-Luminosity LHC or future Higgs factories.</description>

      <title>Photon-dark photon oscillation in M87 and Crab Nebula environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical systems such as neutron stars and black holes provide powerful laboratories for testing feebly coupled dark photons (DPs). We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($\epsilon$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $\epsilon \simeq 7\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A'} \simeq 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\rm ph}$, where $r_{\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius. From the Crab pulsar-wind Nebula, we obtain an even stronger constraint, $\epsilon \simeq 8\times10^{-7}$ at $m_{A'} \simeq 4\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation baselines of order $10^{3}\,\mathrm{km}$, surpassing existing astrophysical limits in realistic plasma backgrounds. While laboratory and cosmological bounds remain slightly stronger at comparable masses, observation of compact objects with larger surface magnetic fields and measurements of photon spectra at lower frequencies would enhance the limits on the photon-DP coupling by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quark-lepton correlations in gauge anomaly free abelian extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $b \to s \ell_1^+ \ell_2^-$ transitions, both for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$, in a minimal extension of the Standard Model proposed in [1]. In this framework, the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is enlarged by a new $U(1)^\prime$ component. The fermion $U(1)^\prime$ charges are assigned in a generation-dependent way, and involve three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ summing to zero by the condition of cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, which produces correlations among quark and lepton observables. The new neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ has flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. For SM allowed processes, small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found: this is a consequence of a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors preclude each other large deviations from SM. Lepton flavour violating processes are allowed at tree-level. The experimental upper bounds for the rates of the processes $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\mu^- \to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ \mu^- \to e^-$ conversion in nuclei play a hierarchical role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays.</description>

      <title>Carrier envelope phase and pulse shape effects on vacuum pair production in asymmetric electric fields with bell-shaped envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape on electron-positron pair production in the presence of an external time-dependent asymmetric electric field by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. We analyze how the pulse asymmetry, the envelope type (Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sauter), and the carrier envelope phase jointly influence the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs. Our results show that pair production exhibits extreme sensitivity to both the degree of temporal asymmetry and the steepness of the envelope on either side of the pulse. These effects are qualitatively explained through a turning-point analysis, which, for the first time, is carried out for a non-analytic electric field using a regularization scheme. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates the Schwinger mechanism in the case of a long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-topped profile, pair production is further facilitated. We demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude by choosing certain field parameters.</description>

Abstract: We compute one-loop QCD corrections to the triple differential width of the inclusive decay $\bar{B} \to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ including contributions from all relevant dimension-six operators in the Weak Effective Theory (WET), at leading power in heavy quark expansion. Furthermore we derive for the first time up to order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ analytic expressions for the first three moments of the distribution in the lepton energy, hadronic invariant mass and dilepton invariant mass, in the presence of beyond the Standard Model contributions from the WET.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4. Percent-Level Cosmological Constraints from Combined Probes and Robust Evidence for the Normal Neutrino Mass Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological parameters measurements from the full combination of DESI DR1 galaxy clustering data described with large-scale structure effective field theory. By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\sigma$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\sigma$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\nu&lt;0.057$ eV in $\Lambda$CDM and $M_\nu&lt;0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent study of new physics effects in the Higgs decay $h \to \Upsilon \gamma$, focusing on scenarios that spoil the accidental cancellation between the direct and indirect amplitudes. After imposing all existing constraints from Higgs production and decay measurements, we find that a wrong-sign $h b\bar b$ coupling is the only viable scenario capable of enhancing the $h \to \Upsilon \gamma$ decay width by nearly two orders of magnitude. Therefore, an observation of a significantly enhanced $h \to \Upsilon \gamma$ rate at the LHC or future colliders would provide unambiguous evidence for a wrong-sign $h b\bar b$ coupling, directly pointing to the presence of an extended Higgs sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a factorization theorem for the structure-dependent QED effects in the weak exclusive process $B^-\to\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell$, i.e., effects probing the internal structure of the $B$ meson. The derivation requires a careful treatment of endpoint-divergent convolutions common to subleading-power factorization formulas. We find that the decay amplitude is sensitive to two- and three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes of the $B$ meson as well as to a new hadronic parameter $F(\mu,\Lambda)$, which generalizes the notion of the $B$-meson decay constant in the presence of QED effects. This is the first derivation of a subleading-power factorization theorem in which the soft functions are non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field to the leading order is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of a compact star and from its spin-down luminosity, using the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. We also project the prospective bounds on the coupling from future measurements of the long-range force between two compact stars in a binary such as PSR J0737-3039, and from the apparent redshifts of compact stars. Future advances in precision-clock sensitivity and targeted observations of stars with strong surface magnetic fields, large radii, and low-frequency emission can substantially tighten these coupling limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse light Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar associated hadro-production in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-X (or lepton-specific) within the parameter space allowed by theoretical self-consistency requirements as well as the latest experimental constraints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), precision data and $B$ physics. Over the viable regions of such a scenario, the Standard Model-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012 is the heavier CP-even state $H$. Furthermore, in the Type-X scenario, due to large $\tan\beta$, the lighter Higgs scalar $h$ and the pseudoscalar $A$ mainly decay into two $\tau$ leptons. Therefore, we concentrate on analysing the signal process $pp\to Z^{*} \to hA\to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to \ell \nu_\ell \ell \nu_\ell \tau_h \tau_h$ (where $\ell= e, \mu$ whereas $\tau_h$ represents the hadronic decay of the $\tau$) and explore the feasibility of conducting such a search at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}~=$ 14 TeV and a luminosity of $L~=~300~fb^{-1}$. To suppress the huge SM background, we confine ourselves to consider the fraction of signal events with two same-sign $\tau$ leptons further decaying into same-sign leptons while the other two $\tau$ leptons decay hadronically. We find that a combination of kinematical selection and machine learning (ML) analysis will yields significant sensitivity to this process at the end of the LHC Run 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Description of spin-dependent hadronic processes at high energies in terms of parton helicities is a both effective and technically convenient means. In the present paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the parton helicities when either Collinear or KT forms of QCD Factorization are used. Starting our studies with calculation of the helicities in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA) in the region of small x and large Q^2, we generalize the results in order to obtain formulae valid at arbitrary x and Q^2. We argue against using Collinear Factorization, when the parton orbital angular momenta are accounted for, and prove that KT Factorization should be used instead. We also consider in detail the small-x asymptotics of the parton helicities, compare them with the DGLAP-asymptotics in LO,NLO, etc and prove that the DGLAP asymptotics are less singular at small x than the Regge asymptotics</description>

      <title>Extending the sensitivity of heavy sterile neutrino searches with solar neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sensitivity study of the search for heavy sterile neutrinos ($\nu_H$) in the MeV mass range using solar neutrino experiments is presented. $\nu_H$, with masses ranging from a few MeV up to around 15 MeV, can be produced in the Sun through $^8$B decay and subsequently decay into $\nu_e e^+ e^-$. Its flux and lifetime strongly depend on the mixing parameter $|U_{eH}|^2$ and mass $m_{\nu_H}$. The $\nu_H$ signal can be detected via its decay products, either the $e^+e^-$ pair or $\nu_e$, depending on whether $\nu_H$ decays inside or outside the detector. Expected signal yields for both detection methods (detecting $e^+e^-$ or $\nu_e$ signal) are presented across the full $|U_{eH}|^2$ and $m_{\nu_H}$ parameter space. These two methods are found to be complementary in different regions of the $|U_{eH}|^2$ and $m_{\nu_H}$ phase space. By combining both approaches, we anticipate observing at least a handful of signal events across most of the parameter space of $10^{-6} &lt; |U_{eH}|^2 &lt; 1$ and 2 MeV $&lt; m_{\nu_H} &lt; $ 14 MeV, assuming a 500-ton solar neutrino experiment operating for one year. Key variables, such as the energy spectra and opening angle of $\nu_e$ or $e^+e^-$ and the solar angle of $\nu_e$ and its scattered electron, are also discussed to help distinguish signal from major backgrounds, such as solar neutrino events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Oscillation Baryogenesis via Ultraviolet Dark Matter Freeze-In</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate baryogenesis from dark matter oscillations in the ultraviolet freeze-in regime. We find that the mechanism can simultaneously accommodate the observed abundances of baryons and dark matter for dark matter masses in the 10 keV to MeV range, provided the reheat temperature lies between the temperature of the electroweak phase transition and ~10 TeV. The mechanism predicts observable consequences due to the presence of a light dark matter component that is relativistic during structure formation, and X-ray bounds on decaying dark matter can set strong constraints depending on the operator mediating dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Tests of BSM Higgs interactions by the combination $(\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V})$ in HHjj production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the potential of analyzing the particular combination of $\kappa$ modifiers given by $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ to disentangle Beyond Standard Model Higgs signals in double Higgs production with two extra light jets at LHC. We use the Higgs Effective Field Theory approach, HEFT, for the gauge invariant description of these two $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ parameters representing the BSM interactions of the Higgs particle with the electroweak gauge bosons, $HVV$ and $HHVV$ respectively. We illustrate the bonus of studying this particular combination $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ focusing in just one process, $HHjj$, instead of studying $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ separately using various processes. For the detailed analysis here, we focus on the particular final state $H(\to \gamma \gamma) H (\to b \bar b)jj'$, with two photons, two b-jets and two light jets, which we analyze fully including parton showering, fragmentation, hadronization and detector effects, in both signal and main background. We find that the sensitivity to $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ could be notably improved at the HL-LHC by the proper cuts on the final state $b \bar b \gamma \gamma jj'$ that select optimally the events with VBF-topology and $HH$-topology. In particular, we propose strategies based on a good isolation of $\gamma \gamma$ and b-jet pairs, and focus specially on specific variables like $\eta_{\gamma \gamma}$ and $P^T_{\gamma \gamma}$ where the signal events distributions may efficiently discriminate between BSM signal versus SM background. We will show here how the high transversality of these two pairs in the signal (inherited from the high transversality of the $H$'s) is correlated with the non-vanishing value of this $(\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V})$ combination.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivities of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays. The implementation of our generic vector-scalar portal model in the Hazma toolkit is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections for $t{\bar t}H$ production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate higher-order soft-gluon corrections for the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a Higgs boson ($t{\bar t}H$ production) using resummation in one-particle-inclusive (1PI) kinematics. By adding these corrections to NLO QCD and NLO electroweak (EW) results, we present cross sections through approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) in QCD and NLO in EW for $t{\bar t}H$ production at LHC energies. These aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW results provide significant enhancements over lower orders and a reduced scale dependence. Based on our results and current experimental data, we derive a constraint on the deviation of the top quark Yukawa coupling from the Standard Model value which is a probe of new physics beyond it. We also calculate top-quark differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-global logarithms are low energy correlations between the substructure of a jet and the event in which it is immersed. We study the leading non-global logarithms that arise from soft quark--anti-quark emission and calculate their coefficient as a series in the jet radius, $R$, in arbitrary processes. We calculate the exact coefficient through quadratic order in $R$, and show that this truncation is within $5\%$ of the complete result for radii up to $R = 1$. These quark flavor-dependent non-global logarithms are also responsible for the infrared unsafety of a na\"ive definition of jet flavor that is simply the net sum of quark flavors in the jet of interest. We propose a small modification of this na\"ive jet flavor that we call subtractive jet flavor in which the problematic soft logarithms are explicitly subtracted. We further demonstrate how our analytic results can be interfaced with automated numerical fixed-order codes to extract subtractive jet flavor cross sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, new developments for the Standard Model Higgs-boson decays will be summarized. This addresses extensions of the grids used by {\tt Hdecay} to implement finite NLO mass effects for $H\to gg$ as well as explicit numbers for the branching fraction for the strange-Yukawa induced part of $H\to s\bar s$ together with the related uncertainties. In addition, first results of the strong and weak Dalitz decays of the Higgs-boson decays $H\to s\bar s + g/\gamma$ are presented. The Dalitz decays define the separation between the Yukawa-induced part and the continuum, that is not induced by the strange-Yukawa coupling, and thus pave the way towards a solid determination of the strange-Yukawa coupling at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, but will also be relevant for solid bounds on the strange-Yukawa coupling at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation in periodically time-dependent media can exhibit driven mode conversion that is absent in static or adiabatic descriptions. We show that photon propagation through a coherent axion dark matter background provides a natural realization of such driven dynamics. In the presence of a magnetic field, the oscillating axion field acts as a coherent temporal drive, inducing resonant photon-axion conversion when the mismatch between their dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\Delta_\gamma - \Delta_a \approx n m_a$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This driven resonance enables efficient mixing far from the conventional level-crossing regime and disappears entirely upon time averaging, explaining why it is missed in standard treatments. The process constitutes a unitary mode-conversion phenomenon that preserves the axion dark matter number density and is distinct from parametric instabilities or axion decay. A systematic description is naturally provided by Floquet theory. We develop a general framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds and show that the resulting resonant mixing leads to characteristic polarization signatures, with potential implications for astrophysical observations such as blazar polarization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Singlet Fermion Dark Matter with a Scalar Portal: Connecting Higgs Phenomenology and Strong Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal extension of the Standard Model with a real singlet scalar and a singlet Dirac fermion acting as dark matter. Unlike a conventional singlet scalar setup, we assume that the singlet scalar does not acquire a vacuum expectation value at zero temperature. This decouples the scalar mixing angle from the Higgs-portal quartic coupling responsible for the strong first-order electroweak phase transition, allowing it to coexist with current collider and direct-detection constraints. The Higgs-singlet mixing is generated independently through a trilinear portal interaction. We check theoretical consistency conditions, various LHC limits on heavy scalar resonances, dark matter relic abundance, and direct detection bounds to delineate the viable parameter space. We perform a detailed analysis of the electroweak phase transition and show that a strong first-order transition is realized for a selected set of benchmark points. We further compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectra and find that several scenarios yield signals potentially observable at future space-based interferometers. Our results establish a unified and testable framework that connects collider phenomenology, first-order electroweak phase transition, and the resulting production of gravitational waves, along with the dark matter phenomenology, all within a simple renormalizable extension of the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We present the first dedicated analysis of cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (CRDM) in paleo detectors. Owing to their large kinetic energies, CRDM particles generate nuclear-recoil tracks that extend to substantially larger lengths than those produced by dominant backgrounds from neutrinos and intrinsic radioactivity. Combined with the ultra-large effective geological exposure of $\mathcal{O}(10^{5})~\mathrm{t\,yr}$, paleo detectors provide a uniquely sensitive probe of sub-GeV DM. Considering both constant and vector-mediator interactions, we find that paleo detectors improve the sensitivity to the DM--proton scattering cross section by one to two orders of magnitude compared with the latest XENONnT limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Loryons, particles beyond the Standard Model that receive a significant fraction of their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking, in the context of a two Higgs doublet model. Using scalar Loryons in the the $[1,1]$, $[1,3]$ (as well as the equivalent $[3,1]$) and the $[2,2]$ representations of the custodial $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ global symmetry as benchmarks, we study the constraints on the Loryon parameter space, focusing on unitarity, Higgs decay observables, and the absence of Loryon vacuum expectation values. We find that while neutral singlet Loryons remain viable for masses up to 700 GeV, representations containing charged scalars are severely constrained by LHC data, particularly as the fraction of mass generated by symmetry breaking increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii in the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of self-bound hybrid stars with large density discontinuities, and thus are radially stable in either the slow or rapid phase transition context. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

Validation steps are presented, in particular, through direct comparisons of GENIE cross-section output with original calculations performed by the authors of the model.

      <title>$\Xi NN$ three-baryon force from SU(3) chiral effective field theory: A femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: The development of SU(3) chiral effective field theory has opened the way to a systematic exploration of three-baryon forces (3BFs), a key ingredient in hypernuclear and dense matter physics. However, $\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.
  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT to derive $\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron--$\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.
  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained. The deuteron--$\Xi^-$ scattering is treated as an effective two-body problem with the $\Xi NN$ 3BF incorporated into the potential between the deuteron and $\Xi^-$.
  Results: We found that the effect of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron--$\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4\%. This small effect is not primarily due to the loosely-bound nature of the deuteron. Instead, this is because the deuteron and $\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.
  Conclusions: Since the correlation function shows limited sensitivity to the short-range 3BF, complementary approaches may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. This conclusion is explicitly verified for several representative nucleation histories, including delta-function, power-law, and power-exponential types. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the conformal variables evaluated at an appropriately defined characteristic collision time.</description>

      <title>An improved formula for Wigner function and spin polarization in a decoupling relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an upgraded formula for Wigner function and spin polarization of fermions emitted by a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the decoupling which improves the one obtained in refs. [1, 2] and used in numerical simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Pulsar Distance Inference from Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are limited in localizing nanohertz continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) by uncertainties in pulsar distances. We introduce a method to infer pulsar distances in two dimensions, using phase information from the pulsar terms of multiple CGW sources. Our approach can enhance distance precision and, in some cases, achieve order-of-magnitude improvements relative to existing one-dimensional distance-inference methods. Using simulations of an SKA-era PTA with realistic parallax-based distance priors, we demonstrate that pulsars at $\sim 1$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision with only a few CGW sources. Such improvements in pulsar-distance precision have important implications for CGW host-galaxy identification and multimessenger observational prospects.</description>

      <title>Plunge-Merger-Ringdown Tests of General Relativity with GW250114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary black hole signal GW250114, the clearest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the relativistic strong-gravity regime. How well does GW250114 agree with Einstein's predictions in the plunge-merger-ringdown stage? To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, at $90\%$ credible level. These constraints are, respectively, two and four times more stringent than those obtained by analyzing GW150914. We also constrain, for the first time, the instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(4,4)$ mode at merger to about $6\%$, and the time at which the gravitational-wave amplitude peaks to about $5~\mathrm{ms}$. These results are the most precise tests of general relativity in the nonlinear regime to date, and can be employed to constrain extensions of Einsten's theory.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>
