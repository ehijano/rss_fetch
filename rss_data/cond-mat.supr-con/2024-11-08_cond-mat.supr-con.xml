      <title>Pressure-Induced Superconductivity at 18.2 K in CuIr2S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.</description>

      <title>Linear non-saturating magnetoresistance and superconductivity in epitaxial thin films of YbSb$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth diantimonides display intriguing ground states often associated with structural order, which can be manipulated in thin film geometries. In this study, we report epitaxial synthesis of one such compound, YbSb$_{2}$, on III-V substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy. The synthesized thin films exhibit large, non-saturating, linear magnetoresistance across a wide magnetic field range. Additionally, they demonstrate superconducting properties, with a critical temperature of $\approx$ 1.025 K and a critical field of $\approx$ 83.85 Oe, consistent with the reports in bulk single crystals. While YbSb$_{2}$ has been classified as a Type-I superconductor in its bulk form, our findings provide evidence of a mixed state in the epitaxial thin films. This work paves the way for controlling the electronic ground state in this class of materials through thin film engineering.</description>

      <title>Achieving superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films by aluminum sputtering deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer (IL, ABO$_2$) nickelates has opened a new avenue to deepen the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. However, progress in this field is slowed by significant challenges in material synthesis and the scarcity of research groups capable of producing high quality superconducting samples. IL nickelates are obtained from a reduction of the perovskite ABO$_3$ phase, typically achieved by annealing using CaH$_2$ as a reducing agent. Here, we present a new method to synthesize superconducting infinite-layer nickelate Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films using an aluminum overlayer deposited by sputtering as a reducing agent. We systematically optimized the aluminum deposition parameters and obtained superconducting samples reduced either in situ or ex situ (after air exposure of the precursor ABO$_3$ films). A comparison of their crystalline quality and transport properties shows that in situ Al reduction enhances the quality of the superconducting Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films, achieving a maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}^{onset}$ of 17 K, in agreement with the optimum value reported for this compound. This simple synthesis route, much more accessible than existing methods, offers better control and reproducibility over the topotactic transformation, opening new opportunities to gain insights into the physics of superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of electronic transitions in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ with Avoided Level Crossing $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ provide a unique platform for studying the interplay between a variety of electronic orders, including superconductivity, charge density waves, nematic phases and more. Understanding the evolution of the electronic state from the charge density wave to the superconducting transition is essential for unraveling the interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom giving rise to the unusual magnetic properties of these nonmagnetic metals. Previous zero-field and high-field $\mu$SR studies revealed two anomalies in the muon spin relaxation rate, a first change at $T_{CDW} \sim 100$ K and a second steep increase at $T^{*}\sim 40$ K, further enhanced by an applied magnetic field, thus suggesting a contribution of magnetic origin. In this study, we use the avoided level crossing $\mu$SR technique to investigate charge order in near-zero applied field. By tracking the temperature dependence of quadrupolar level-crossing resonances, we examined the evolution of the electric field gradient at V nuclei in the kagome plane. Our results show a significant rearrangement of the charge density starting at $T^{*}$ indicating a transition in the charge distribution, likely electronic in origin, well below $T_{CDW}$. These findings, combined with previous $\mu$SR, STM, and NMR studies, emphasize the intertwined nature of proximate phases in these systems, with the charge rearrangement dominating the additional increase in $\mu$SR relaxation rate below $T^{*}$.</description>

      <title>The Floquet Fluxonium Molecule: Driving Down Dephasing in Coupled Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-coherence qubits, which can store and manipulate quantum states for long times with low error rates, are necessary building blocks for quantum computers. Here we propose a driven superconducting erasure qubit, the Floquet fluxonium molecule, which minimizes bit-flip rates through disjoint support of its qubit states and suppresses phase flips by a novel second-order insensitivity to flux-noise dephasing. We estimate the bit-flip, phase-flip, and erasure rates through numerical simulations, with predicted coherence times of approximately 50 ms in the computational subspace and erasure lifetimes of about 500 $\mu$s. We also present a protocol for performing high-fidelity single-qubit rotation gates via additional flux modulation, on timescales of roughly 500 ns, and propose a scheme for erasure detection and logical readout. Our results demonstrate the utility of drives for building new qubits that can outperform their static counterparts.</description>
