      <title>FFT and Linear Convolution Implementation with Bit Slicing Multiplier: A Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and linear convolution implementations, integrating both conventional methods and novel approaches leveraging the Bit Slicing Multiplier (BSM) technique. The Bit Slicing Multiplier utilizes Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to execute bitwise operations in parallel, offering efficient arithmetic operations ideally suited for digital signal processing tasks. We extensively investigate the integration of BSM into FFT and linear convolution algorithms, emphasizing its advantages in terms of speed and resource utilization. Additionally, we introduce our own innovative ideas for FFT and convolution algorithms, contributing to the broader discourse on efficient signal processing techniques. Experimental validation of our implementations is conducted using Vivado, a leading FPGA synthesis and implementation tool. Comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of our BSM-enhanced approaches, showcasing their potential for real-time signal processing applications. This study not only advances the understanding of FFT and convolution implementations but also highlights the effectiveness of novel techniques like BSM in enhancing computational efficiency in FPGA-based systems.</description>

      <title>Joint State and Parameter Estimation Using the Partial Errors-in-Variables Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a new method for joint state and parameter estimation in uncertain dynamical systems. We exploit the partial errors-in-variables (PEIV) principle and formulate a regression problem in the sense of weighted total least squares, where the uncertainty in the parameter prior is explicitly considered. Based thereon, the PEIV regression can be solved iteratively through the Kalman smoothing and the regularized least squares for estimating the state and the parameter, respectively. The simulations demonstrate improved accuracy of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, including the joint maximum a posterior-maximum likelihood, the expectation maximisation, and the augmented state extended Kalman smoother.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Based Optimization for Large Scale Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms for wireless systems play a fundamental role in improving their performance and efficiency. However, it is known that the complexity of conventional optimization algorithms in the literature often exponentially increases with the number of transmit antennas and communication users in the wireless system. Therefore, in the large scale regime, the astronomically large complexity of these optimization algorithms prohibits their use and prevents assessing large scale wireless systems performance under optimized conditions. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes instead the use of an unsupervised meta-learning based approach to directly perform non-convex optimization at significantly reduced complexity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning based solution, the sum-rate (SR) maximization problem for the following three emerging 6G technologies is contemplated: hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (H-RSMA), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS). Through numerical results, it is demonstrated that the proposed meta-learning based optimization framework is able to successfully optimize the performance and also reveal unknown aspects of the operation in the large scale regime for the considered three 6G technologies.</description>

      <title>Relay-Assisted Carrier Aggregation (RACA) Uplink System for Enhancing Data Rate of Extended Reality (XR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Extended Reality (XR) applications, high data rates and low latency are crucial for immersive experiences. Uplink transmission in XR is challenging due to the limited antennas and power of lightweight XR devices. To improve data transmission rates, we investigate a relay-assisted carrier aggregation (RACA) system. The XR device simultaneously transmits data to an access point (AP) and a relay in proximity over low-frequency and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then, the relay down-converts and amplifies the signals to the AP, effectively acting as an additional transmit antenna for the XR device. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to maximize the data rate of the XR device in their respective protocols. In the centralized protocol, the rate maximization problem is equivalently transformed as a weighted mean square error minimization (WMMSE) problem which can be solved iteratively by alternative optimization. In the distributed protocol, the rate maximization problem is decomposed into two independent sub-problems where the rate of the direct link and the rate of the relay link are maximized by singular value decomposition (SVD)-based methods with water-filling (WF). Simulation results show that the rate of the RACA system is improved by $32\%$ compared to that of the conventional carrier aggregation scheme.</description>

      <title>A Fast Multitaper Power Spectrum Estimation in Nonuniformly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonuniformly sampled signals are prevalent in real-world applications but pose a significant challenge when estimating their power spectra from a finite number of samples of a single realization. The optimal solution using Bronez Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (GPSS) is computationally intensive and thus impractical for large datasets. This paper presents a fast nonparametric method, MultiTaper NonUniform Fast Fourier Transform (MTNUFFT), capable of estimating power spectra with lower computational burden. The method first derives a set of optimal tapers via cubic spline interpolation on a nominal analysis band, and subsequently shifts these tapers to other analysis bands using NonUniform FFT (NUFFT). The estimated spectral power within the band is the average power at the outputs of the taper set. This algorithm eliminates the time-consuming computation for solving the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP), thus reducing the computational load from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N \log N + N \log(1/\epsilon))$, comparable with the NUFFT. The statistical properties of the estimator are assessed using Bronez GPSS theory, revealing that the bias and variance bound of the MTNUFFT estimator are identical to those of the optimal estimator. Furthermore, the degradation of bias bound can serve as a measure of the deviation from optimality. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using both simulation and real-world data, demonstrating its practical applicability. The code of the proposed fast algorithm is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jiecui/mtnufft).</description>

      <title>A Survey on Advancements in THz Technology for 6G: Systems, Circuits, Antennas, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) carrier frequencies (100 GHz to 10 THz) have been touted as a source for unprecedented wireless connectivity and high-precision sensing, courtesy of their wide bandwidth availability and small wavelengths, but noteworthy implementation challenges remain to make this a reality. In this paper, we survey recent advancements in THz technology and its role in future 6G wireless networks, with a particular emphasis on the 200-400 GHz frequency range and the IEEE 802.15.3d standard. We provide a comprehensive overview of THz systems, circuits, device technology, and antennas, while also highlighting recent experimental demonstrations of THz technology. Throughout the paper, we review the state-of-the-art and call attention to open problems, future prospects, and areas of further improvement to fully realize the potential of THz communication in next-generation wireless connectivity.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted NLOS Sensing With OFDM Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted target sensing in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario, where an IRS is employed to facilitate the radar/access point (AP) to sense the targets when the line-of-sight (LOS) path between the AP and the target is blocked by obstacles. To sense the targets, the AP transmits a train of uniformly-spaced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pulses, and then perceives the targets based on the echoes from the AP-IRS-targets-IRS-AP channel. To resolve an inherent scaling ambiguity associated with IRS-assisted NLOS sensing, we propose a two-phase sensing scheme by exploiting the diversity in the illumination pattern of the IRS across two different phases. Specifically, the received echo signals from the two phases are formulated as third-order tensors. Then a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition-based method is developed to estimate each target's parameters including the direction of arrival (DOA), Doppler shift and time delay. Our analysis reveals that the proposed method achieves reliable NLOS sensing using a modest quantity of pulse/subcarrier resources. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method under the challenging scenario where the degrees-of-freedom provided by the AP-IRS channel are not enough for resolving the scaling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Transport Map Coupling Filter for State-Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are subjected to stochastic influences, such as random excitations, noise, and unmodeled behavior. Tracking the system's state and parameters based on a physical model is a common task for which filtering algorithms, such as Kalman filters and their non-linear extensions, are typically used. However, many of these filters use assumptions on the transition probabilities or the covariance model, which can lead to inaccuracies in non-linear systems. We will show the application of a stochastic coupling filter that can approximate arbitrary transition densities under non-Gaussian noise. The filter is based on transport maps, which couple the approximation densities to a user-chosen reference density, allowing for straightforward sampling and evaluation of probabilities.</description>

      <title>White-Box 3D-OMP-Transformer for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have found broad applications for their great ability to capture long-range dependency among the inputs using attention mechanisms. The recent success of transformers increases the need for mathematical interpretation of their underlying working mechanisms, leading to the development of a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures. However, designing white-box transformers with efficient three-dimensional (3D) attention is still an open challenge. In this work, we revisit the 3D-orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm and demonstrate that the operation of 3D-OMP is analogous to a specific kind of transformer with 3D attention. Therefore, we build a white-box 3D-OMP-transformer by introducing additional learnable parameters to 3D-OMP. As a transformer, its 3D-attention can be mathematically interpreted from 3D-OMP; while as a variant of OMP, it can learn to improve the matching pursuit process from data. Besides, a transformer's performance can be improved by stacking more transformer blocks. To simulate this process, we design a cascaded 3D-OMP-Transformer with dynamic small-scale dictionaries, which can improve the performance of the 3D-OMP-Transformer with low costs. We evaluate the designed 3D-OMP-transformer in the multi-target detection task of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Experimental results show that the designed 3D-OMP-Transformer can outperform current baselines.</description>

      <title>Off-Grid Ultrasound Imaging by Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound images formed by delay-and-sum beamforming are plagued by artifacts that only clear up after compounding many transmissions. Some prior works pose imaging as an inverse problem. This approach can yield high image quality with few transmits, but requires a very fine image grid and is not robust to changes in measurement model parameters. We present INverse grid-Free Estimation of Reflectivities (INFER), an off-grid and stochastic algorithm that solves the inverse scattering problem in ultrasound imaging. Our method jointly optimizes for the locations of the gridpoints, their reflectivities, and the measurement model parameters such as the speed of sound. This approach allows us to use significantly fewer gridpoints, while obtaining better contrast and resolution and being more robust to changes in the imaging target and the hardware. The use of stochastic optimization enables solving for multiple transmissions simultaneously without increasing the required memory or computational load per iteration. We show that our method works across different imaging targets and across different transmit schemes and compares favorably against other beamforming and inverse solvers. The source code and the dataset to reproduce the results in this paper are available at www.github.com/vincentvdschaft/off-grid-ultrasound.</description>

      <title>Coding-Enhanced Cooperative Jamming for Secret Communication: The MIMO Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11462v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with a legitimate transmitter, a legitimate receiver (Bob), an eavesdropper (Eve), and a cooperative jammer. All nodes may be equipped with multiple antennas. Traditionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN) to enhance the security. However, using this approach, the jamming signal interferes not only with Eve but also with Bob. In this paper, besides the GN strategy, we assume that the jammer can also choose to use the encoded jammer (EJ) strategy, i.e., instead of GN, it transmits a codeword from an appropriate codebook. In certain conditions, the EJ scheme enables Bob to decode the jamming codeword and thus cancel the interference, while Eve remains unable to do so even if it knows all the codebooks. We first derive an inner bound on the system's secrecy rate under the strong secrecy metric, and then consider the maximization this bound through precoder design in a computationally efficient manner. In the single-input multi-output (SIMO) case, we prove that although non-convex, the power control problems can be optimally solved for both GN and EJ schemes. In the MIMO case, we propose to solve the problems using the matrix simultaneous diagonalization (SD) technique, which requires quite a low computational complexity. Simulation results show that by introducing a cooperative jammer with coding capability, and allowing it to switch between the GN and EJ schemes, a dramatic increase in the secrecy rate can be achieved. In addition, the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the current state of the art benchmarks in terms of both secrecy rate and computation time.</description>

      <title>Deep Harmonic Finesse: Signal Separation in Wearable Systems with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method, referred to as Deep Harmonic Finesse (DHF), for separation of non-stationary quasi-periodic signals when limited data is available. The problem frequently arises in wearable systems in which, a combination of quasi-periodic physiological phenomena give rise to the sensed signal, and excessive data collection is prohibitive. Our approach utilizes prior knowledge of time-frequency patterns in the signals to mask and in-paint spectrograms. This is achieved through an application-inspired deep harmonic neural network coupled with an integrated pattern alignment component. The network's structure embeds the implicit harmonic priors within the time-frequency domain, while the pattern-alignment method transforms the sensed signal, ensuring a strong alignment with the network. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in the context of non-invasive fetal monitoring using both synthesized and in vivo data. When applied to the synthesized data, our method exhibits significant improvements in signal-to-distortion ratio (26% on average) and mean squared error (80% on average), compared to the best competing method. When applied to in vivo data captured in pregnant animal studies, our method improves the correlation error between estimated fetal blood oxygen saturation and the ground truth by 80.5% compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>SpeakerBeam-SS: Real-time Target Speaker Extraction with Lightweight Conv-TasNet and State Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time target speaker extraction (TSE) is intended to extract the desired speaker's voice from the observed mixture of multiple speakers in a streaming manner. Implementing real-time TSE is challenging as the computational complexity must be reduced to provide real-time operation. This work introduces to Conv-TasNet-based TSE a new architecture based on state space modeling (SSM) that has been shown to model long-term dependency effectively. Owing to SSM, fewer dilated convolutional layers are required to capture temporal dependency in Conv-TasNet, resulting in the reduction of model complexity. We also enlarge the window length and shift of the convolutional (TasNet) frontend encoder to reduce the computational cost further; the performance decline is compensated by over-parameterization of the frontend encoder. The proposed method reduces the real-time factor by 78% from the conventional causal Conv-TasNet-based TSE while matching its performance.</description>

      <title>Constant Directivity Loudspeaker Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loudspeaker array beamforming is a common signal processing technique for acoustic directivity control and robust audio reproduction. Unlike their microphone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to arrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency, acoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work proposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient directivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for maximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant directivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their quadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments optimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a full-band heterogeneous array.</description>

      <title>TTSlow: Slow Down Text-to-Speech with Efficiency Robustness Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has been extensively studied for generating high-quality speech with textual inputs, playing a crucial role in various real-time applications. For real-world deployment, ensuring stable and timely generation in TTS models against minor input perturbations is of paramount importance. Therefore, evaluating the robustness of TTS models against such perturbations, commonly known as adversarial attacks, is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose TTSlow, a novel adversarial approach specifically tailored to slow down the speech generation process in TTS systems. To induce long TTS waiting time, we design novel efficiency-oriented adversarial loss to encourage endless generation process. TTSlow encompasses two attack strategies targeting both text inputs and speaker embedding. Specifically, we propose TTSlow-text, which utilizes a combination of homoglyphs-based and swap-based perturbations, along with TTSlow-spk, which employs a gradient optimization attack approach for speaker embedding. TTSlow serves as the first attack approach targeting a wide range of TTS models, including autoregressive and non-autoregressive TTS ones, thereby advancing exploration in audio security. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the inference efficiency of TTS models, and in-depth analysis of generated speech intelligibility is performed using Gemini. The results demonstrate that TTSlow can effectively slow down two TTS models across three publicly available datasets. We are committed to releasing the source code upon acceptance, facilitating further research and benchmarking in this domain.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Face-Mask Speech Enhancement Using Generative Adversarial Networks with Human-in-the-Loop Assessment Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of face masks is an essential healthcare measure, particularly during times of pandemics, yet it can present challenges in communication in our daily lives. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach known as the human-in-the-loop StarGAN (HL-StarGAN) face-masked speech enhancement method. HL-StarGAN comprises discriminator, classifier, metric assessment predictor, and generator that leverages an attention mechanism. The metric assessment predictor, referred to as MaskQSS, incorporates human participants in its development and serves as a "human-in-the-loop" module during the learning process of HL-StarGAN. The overall HL-StarGAN model was trained using an unsupervised learning strategy that simultaneously focuses on the reconstruction of the original clean speech and the optimization of human perception. To implement HL-StarGAN, we curated a face-masked speech database named "FMVD," which comprises recordings from 34 speakers in three distinct face-masked scenarios and a clean condition. We conducted subjective and objective tests on the proposed HL-StarGAN using this database. The outcomes of the test results are as follows: (1) MaskQSS successfully predicted the quality scores of face mask voices, outperforming several existing speech assessment methods. (2) The integration of the MaskQSS predictor enhanced the ability of HL-StarGAN to transform face mask voices into high-quality speech; this enhancement is evident in both objective and subjective tests, outperforming conventional StarGAN and CycleGAN-based systems.</description>

      <title>Behavior Forests: Real-Time Discovery of Dynamic Behavior for Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Driving Systems (ADS) development relies on utilizing real-world vehicle data. The volume of data generated by modern vehicles presents transmission, storage, and computational challenges. Focusing on Dynamic Behavior (DB) offers a promising approach to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information for ADS functionalities, thereby reducing data. Time series pattern recognition is beneficial for this task as it can analyze the temporal context of vehicle driving behavior. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often lack the adaptability to identify variable-length patterns or provide analytical descriptions of discovered patterns. This contribution proposes a Behavior Forest framework for real-time data selection by constructing a Behavior Graph during vehicle operation, facilitating analytical descriptions without pre-training. The method demonstrates its performance using a synthetically generated and electrocardiogram data set. An automotive time series data set is used to evaluate the data reduction capabilities, in which this method discarded 96.01% of the incoming data stream, while relevant DB remain included.</description>

      <title>Non-Terrestrial Networks for 6G: Integrated, Intelligent and Ubiquitous Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal connectivity has been part of past and current generations of wireless systems, but as we approach 6G, the subject of social responsibility is being built as a core component. Given the advent of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), reaching these goals will be much closer to realization than ever before. Owing to the benefits of NTN, the integration NTN and Terrestrial Networks (TN) is still infancy, where the past, the current and the future releases in the 3$^{\text{rd}}$ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provide guidelines to adopt a successfully co-existence/integration of TN and NTN. Therefore, in this article, we have illustrated through 3GPP guidelines, on how NTN and TN can effectively be integrated. Moreover, the role of beamforming and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms is highlighted to achieve this integration. Finally the usefulness of integrating NTN and TN is validated through experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Coding-Enhanced Cooperative Jamming for Secret Communication in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the secret communication problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the legitimate transmitter transmits an information-bearing signal to the legitimate receiver, and at the same time, transmits a jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike the conventional jamming scheme, which usually transmits Gaussian noise that interferes not only with Eve but also with the legitimate receiver, in this letter, we consider that encoded codewords are transmitted to jam Eve. Then, by employing appropriate coding schemes, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the jamming signal and then cancel the interference, while Eve cannot, even if it knows the codebooks. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate through port selection and power control. Although the problem is non-convex, we show that the optimal solution can be found. Simulation results show that by using the FAS technique and the proposed jamming scheme, the secrecy rate of the system can be significantly increased.</description>

      <title>SUPER: Seated Upper Body Pose Estimation using mmWave Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial countries, adults spend a considerable amount of time sedentary each day at work, driving and during activities of daily living. Characterizing the seated upper body human poses using mmWave radars is an important, yet under-studied topic with many applications in human-machine interaction, transportation and road safety. In this work, we devise SUPER, a framework for seated upper body human pose estimation that utilizes dual-mmWave radars in close proximity. A novel masking algorithm is proposed to coherently fuse data from the radars to generate intensity and Doppler point clouds with complementary information for high-motion but small radar cross section areas (e.g., upper extremities) and low-motion but large RCS areas (e.g. torso). A lightweight neural network extracts both global and local features of upper body and output pose parameters for the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. Extensive leave-one-subject-out experiments on various motion sequences from multiple subjects show that SUPER outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 30 -- 184%. We also demonstrate its utility in a simple downstream task for hand-object interaction.</description>

      <title>Explaining Deep Learning for ECG Analysis: Building Blocks for Auditing and Knowledge Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have become increasingly popular for analyzing ECG data because of their ability to accurately identify cardiac conditions and hidden clinical factors. However, the lack of transparency due to the black box nature of these models is a common concern. To address this issue, explainable AI (XAI) methods can be employed. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of post-hoc XAI methods, investigating the local (attributions per sample) and global (based on domain expert concepts) perspectives. We have established a set of sanity checks to identify sensible attribution methods, and we provide quantitative evidence in accordance with expert rules. This dataset-wide analysis goes beyond anecdotal evidence by aggregating data across patient subgroups. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these XAI techniques can be utilized for knowledge discovery, such as identifying subtypes of myocardial infarction. We believe that these proposed methods can serve as building blocks for a complementary assessment of the internal validity during a certification process, as well as for knowledge discovery in the field of ECG analysis.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.

Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is the problem of solving a linear system of equations, where the right-hand-side vector is known only up to a permutation. In this work, we study fields of rational functions related to symmetric polynomials and their images under a linear projection of the variables; as a consequence, we establish that the solution to an n-dimensional unlabeled sensing problem with generic data can be obtained as the unique solution to a system of n + 1 polynomial equations of degrees 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 in n unknowns. Besides the new theoretical insights, this development offers the potential for scaling up algebraic unlabeled sensing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Aberration-Induced Noise: A Deep Learning-Based Aberration-to-Aberration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of suboptimal image quality in ultrasound imaging is phase aberration. It is caused by spatial changes in sound speed over a heterogeneous medium, which disturbs the transmitted waves and prevents coherent summation of echo signals. Obtaining non-aberrated ground truths in real-world scenarios can be extremely challenging, if not impossible. This challenge hinders the performance of deep learning-based techniques due to the domain shift between simulated and experimental data. Here, for the first time, we propose a deep learning-based method that does not require ground truth to correct the phase aberration problem and, as such, can be directly trained on real data. We train a network wherein both the input and target output are randomly aberrated radio frequency (RF) data. Moreover, we demonstrate that a conventional loss function such as mean square error is inadequate for training such a network to achieve optimal performance. Instead, we propose an adaptive mixed loss function that employs both B-mode and RF data, resulting in more efficient convergence and enhanced performance. Finally, we publicly release our dataset, comprising over 180,000 aberrated single plane-wave images (RF data), wherein phase aberrations are modeled as near-field phase screens. Although not utilized in the proposed method, each aberrated image is paired with its corresponding aberration profile and the non-aberrated version, aiming to mitigate the data scarcity problem in developing deep learning-based techniques for phase aberration correction.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Kinematics-Based Sensor-Fault Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Using Single and Double Transport with Adaptive Numerical Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor-fault detection is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This paper introduces a novel kinematics-based approach for detecting and identifying faulty sensors, which is model-independent, rule-free, and applicable to ground and aerial vehicles. This method, called kinematics-based sensor fault detection (KSFD), relies on kinematic relations, sensor measurements, and real-time single and double numerical differentiation. Using onboard data from radar, rate gyros, magnetometers, and accelerometers, KSFD uniquely identifies a single faulty sensor in real time. To achieve this, adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) is used for real-time single and double numerical differentiation of the sensor data, and the single and double transport theorems are used to evaluate the consistency of data. Unlike model-based and knowledge-based methods, KSFD relies solely on sensor signals, kinematic relations, and AISE for real-time numerical differentiation. For ground vehicles, KSFD requires six kinematics-based error metrics, whereas, for aerial vehicles, nine error metrics are used. Simulated and experimental examples are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of KSFD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>

      <title>Deep Imbalanced Regression to Estimate Vascular Age from PPG Data: a Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is emerging as a crucial tool for monitoring human hemodynamics, with recent studies highlighting its potential in assessing vascular aging through deep learning. However, real-world age distributions are often imbalanced, posing significant challenges for deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, simple, and effective loss function named the Dist Loss to address deep imbalanced regression tasks. We trained a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Net1D) incorporating the Dist Loss on the extensive UK Biobank dataset (n=502,389) to estimate vascular age from PPG signals and validate its efficacy in characterizing cardiovascular health. The model's performance was validated on a 40% held-out test set, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially in regions with small sample sizes. Furthermore, we divided the population into three subgroups based on the difference between predicted vascular age and chronological age: less than -10 years, between -10 and 10 years, and greater than 10 years. We analyzed the relationship between predicted vascular age and several cardiovascular events over a follow-up period of up to 10 years, including death, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Our results indicate that the predicted vascular age has significant potential to reflect an individual's cardiovascular health status. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ngk03/AI-vascular-age.</description>
