      <title>Local times of deterministic paths with finite variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we define the numbers of level crossings by a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g (RCLL) real function $x: [0,+\infty) \rightarrow R$ and, in analogy to the work of Bertoin and Yor [BY14] we prove that for $x$ with locally finite total variation these numbers are densities of relevant occupation measures associated with $x$. Next, depending on the regularity of $x$ and $f: R \rightarrow R$, we derive change of variable formulas, which may be seen as analogous of the It\^o or Tanaka-Meyer formulas. Some of these formulas are present in [BY14] but we also present some generalizations.</description>

      <title>Results on comparison and sub/super-stabilizability of some new means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analysis of some new means recently intorduced by M. Ra\"{i}ssouli. We establish comparison relations and results on $(K,N)$-sub/super-stabilizability where $K$ and $N$ belong to the class of power means, denoted by $B_p$, and $M$ is one of the classical or recently studied new means. Assuming that means $K$, $M$ and $N$ have asymptotic expansions, we present the complete asymptotic expansion of the resultant mean-map. As an application of the obtained asymptotic expansions and the asymptotic inequality between $M$ and $\mathcal{R}(B_p,M,B_q)$, we show how to find the optimal parameters $p$ and $q$ for which $M$ is $(B_p,B_q)$-sub/super-stabilizable.</description>

      <title>On sets of orthogonal exponentials on the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $A$ is a set of mutually orthogonal exponentials with respect to the unit disk then $|A \cap [-R, R]^2| \lesssim_\varepsilon R^{3/5+\varepsilon}$ holds. This improves the previous bound of $R^{2/3}$ by Iosevich--Kolountzakis. The main new ingredient in the proof is a variant of Marstrand's projection theorem.</description>

      <title>Dunkl symmetric coherent pairs of measures. An application to Fourier Dunkl-Sobolev expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}_{\mu}$ be the Dunkl operator. A pair of symmetric measures $(u, v)$ supported on a symmetric subset of the real line is said to be a symmetric Dunkl-coherent pair if the corresponding sequences of monic orthogonal polynomials $\{P_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ and $\{R_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ (resp.) satisfy $$
  R_{n}(x)=\frac{\mathcal{T}_{\mu}P_{n+1} (x)}{\mu_{n+1}}-\sigma_{n-1}\frac{\mathcal{T}_{\mu} P_{n-1}(x)}{\mu_{n-1}}, n\geq 2,$$
  where $\{\sigma_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a sequence of non-zero complex numbers and $\mu_{2n}=2n, \mu_{2n-1}= 2n-1+ 2\mu, n\geq 1.$
  In this contribution we focus the attention on the sequence $\{S_n^{(\lambda,\mu)}\}_{n\geq 0}$ of monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Dunkl-Sobolev inner product $$
  &lt;p,q&gt;_{s,\mu}=&lt;u,pq&gt;+\lambda&lt;v,\mathcal{T}_{\mu}p\mathcal{T}_{\mu}q&gt;, \lambda &gt;0, \ \ p, \ q \ \in \mathcal{P}.$$
  An algorithm is stated to compute the coefficients of the Fourier--Sobolev type expansions with respect to $&lt;. , .&gt;$ for suitable smooth functions $f$ such that $f \in\mathcal{W}_2^1(R, u, v, \mu)=\{ f; \ \|f\|_{u}^{2} + \lambda \| \mathcal{T}_{\mu }f\|_{v}^{2} &lt;\infty\}$. Finally, two illustrative numerical examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Traveling Wave Solutions For Newton's Equations of Celestial Mechanics: Kepler's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article produces wave equations and constructs traveling wave solutions that are intimately related to Newton's equations of celestial mechanics. The traveling wave solutions are expressed in ``closed form'' in terms of elementary functions. They are specialized to the 2-body and the relative 2-body problem. The traveling wave solutions disclose the shape and position of wave fronts emanating from collisions by determining the location of the singularities of the traveling wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Sharp convergence rate on Schr\"{o}dinger type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Schr\"{o}dinger type operators in one dimension, we consider the relationship between the convergence rate and the regularity for initial data. By establishing the associated frequency-localized maximal estimates, we prove sharp results up to the endpoints. The optimal range for the wave operator in all dimensions is also obtained.</description>

      <title>On resonant energy sets for Hamiltonian systems with reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. We also indicate which classes of potentials each of the three possibilities can occur in. From this point of view, the last case (strongly resonant) is the most interesting. Then, the potentials belong to a special class of potentials, denoted by $\mathcal{SP}$, which seems unknown in the literature. The presented results appear to be new, even in the simplest case, when the uncoupled oscillators are not trapped in any set.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms from Functional Equations: The Goldie Equation, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.05816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this sequel to arXiv1407.4089 by the second author, we extend to multi-dimensional (or infinite-dimensional) settings the Goldie equation arising in the general regular variation of `General regular variation, Popa groups and quantifier weakening', J. Math. Anal. Appl. 483 (2020) 123610, 31 pp. (arXiv1901.05996). We extend the work there in two directions. First, we algebraicize the theory, by systematic use of certain groups -- the Popa groups arising in earlier work by Popa, and their relatives the Javor groups. Secondly, we extend from the original context on the real line to multi-dimensional (or infinite-dimensional) settings.</description>

      <title>The Goldie Equation: III. Homomorphisms from Functional Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second of three sequels to arXiv1407.4089 -- the third of the resulting quartet -- concerning the real-valued continuous solutions of the multivariate Goldie functional equation (GFE) below of Levi-Civita type. Following on from the preceding paper arXiv1910.05816, in which these solutions are described explicitly, here we characterize (GFE) as expressing homomorphy (in all but some exceptional "improper" cases) between multivariate Popa groups, defined and characterized earlier in the sequence. The group operation involves a form of affine addition (with local scalar acceleration) similar to the circle operation of ring theory. We show the affine action in (GFE) may be replaced by general continuous acceleration yielding a functional equation (GGE) which it emerges has the same solution structure as (GFE). The final member of the sequence arXiv2105.07794 considers the richer framework of a Banach algebra which allows vectorial acceleration, giving the closest possible similarity to the circle operation.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider families of polynomial lemniscates in the complex plane and determine if they bound a Jordan domain. This allows us to find examples of regions for which we can calculate the projection of $\bar{z}$ to the Bergman space of the bounded region. Such knowledge has applications to the calculation of torsional rigidity.</description>

      <title>Sparse gradient bounds for divergence form elliptic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sparse estimates for gradients of solutions to divergence form elliptic partial differential equations in terms of the source data. We give a general result of Meyers (or Gehring) type, a result for linear equations with VMO coefficients and a result for linear equations with Dini continuous coefficients. In addition, we provide an abstract theorem conditional on PDE estimates available. The linear results have the full range of weighted estimates with Muckenhoupt weights as a consequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We help Alice play a certain "convergence game" against Bob and win the prize, which is a constructive solution to a problem by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, posed in their 1980 book on open questions in combinatorial number theory. Namely, after several reductions using peculiar arithmetic identities, the game outcome shows that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This generalizes a two-dimensional result by Erd\H{o}s and Straus.</description>
