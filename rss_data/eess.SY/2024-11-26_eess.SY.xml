      <title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Voltage Protection Against Load Alteration Attacks On Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grids are designed to efficiently handle variable power demands, especially for large loads, by real-time monitoring, distributed generation and distribution of electricity. However, the grid's distributed nature and the internet connectivity of large loads like Heating Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems introduce vulnerabilities in the system that cyber-attackers can exploit, potentially leading to grid instability and blackouts. Traditional protection strategies, primarily designed to handle transmission line faults are often inadequate against such threats, emphasising the need for enhanced grid security. In this work, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based protection system that learns to differentiate any stealthy load alterations from normal grid operations and adaptively adjusts activation thresholds of the protection schemes. We train this adaptive protection scheme against an optimal and stealthy load alteration attack model that manipulates the power demands of HVACs at the most unstable grid buses to induce blackouts. We theoretically prove that the adaptive protection system trained in this competitive game setting can effectively mitigate any stealthy load alteration-based attack. To corroborate this, we also demonstrate the method's success in several real-world grid scenarios by implementing it in a hardware-in-loop setup.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the impact of heterogeneous platoon for mixed traffic flow: control strategy, fuel consumption and emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with traditional vehicle longitudinal spacing control strategies, the combination spacing strategy can integrate the advantages of different spacing control strategies. However, the impact mechanism of different combination spacing control strategies on mixed traffic flow has not been analyzed yet. Therefore, this paper proposes various combination spacing control strategies for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). First, a mixed traffic flow model was developed to analyze the characteristics of CAV platoons. On this basis, a probability model of vehicle distribution was derived, and its effectiveness was verified through simulation. Then, multiple spacing combination strategies are proposed based on four spacing control strategies. Finally, numerical experiments were conducted to calculate the average fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of mixed traffic flow under different spacing control strategies, and the impact of platoon spacing control strategies on traffic flow fuel consumption and pollutant emissions was further analyzed. Results show that: (1) the differences in average fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of traffic flow are relatively small under different platoon spacing control strategies under low traffic density (i.e., 15 veh/km); (2) at medium to high traffic densities (i.e., 55-95 veh/km), when the penetration rate of CAVs exceeds 80%, VTG1-CS, VTG2-CS, and CTG-CS strategies can effectively ensure traffic flow stability and safety, and significantly reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Optimal Security Allocation in Networks against Stealthy Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the security allocation problem in a networked control system under stealthy injection attacks. The networked system is comprised of interconnected subsystems which are represented by nodes in a digraph. An adversary compromises the system by injecting false data into several nodes with the aim of maximally disrupting the performance of the network while remaining stealthy to a defender. To minimize the impact of such stealthy attacks, the defender, with limited knowledge about attack policies and attack resources, allocates several sensors on nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint governing the attack policy. We provide an optimal security allocation algorithm to minimize the expected attack impact on the entire network. Furthermore, under a suitable local control design, the proposed security allocation algorithm can be executed in a scalable way. Finally, the obtained results are validated through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Beyond inherent robustness: strong stability of MPC despite plant-model mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic stability of MPC under plant-model mismatch, considering primarily models where the origin remains a steady state despite mismatch. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in both algebraic and engineering examples. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safety Verification for Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust safety verification method for Markov decision processes where only an ambiguous transition kernel is available instead of the precise transition kernel. We define the ambiguity set around the nominal distribution by considering a Wasserstein distance. To this end, we introduce a \textit{robust safety function} to characterize probabilistic safety in the face of uncertain transition probability. First, we obtain an upper bound on the robust safety function in terms of a distributionally robust Q-function. Then, we present a convex program-based distributionally robust Q-iteration algorithm to compute the robust Q-function. By considering a numerical example, we demonstrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Boundary Feasibility for PDE Control with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a general neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectorywise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on a neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the model-free controller baselines.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hierarchical AoII over unreliable channel: A Stochastic Hybrid System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHSs) analysis of traditional AoI to the AoII metric. Hierarchical ageing processes are adopted using the continuous AoII for the first time, where two different hierarchy schemes, i.e., a hybrid of linear ageing processes with different slopes and a hybrid of linear and quadratic ageing processes, are considered. We first modify the main result in \cite[Theorem 1]{yates_age_2020b} to provide a systematic way to analyze the continuous hierarchical AoII over unslotted real-time systems. The closed-form expressions of average hierarchical AoII are obtained based on our Theorem \ref{theorem1} in two typical scenarios with different channel conditions, i.e., an M/M/1/1 queue over noisy channel and two M/M/1/1 queues over collision channel. Moreover, we analyze the stability conditions for two scenarios given that the quadratic ageing process may lead to the absence of stationary solutions. Finally, we compare the average age performance between the classic AoI results and our AoII results in the M/M/1/1 queue, and the effects of different channel parameters on AoII are also evaluated.</description>

      <title>A Human-optimized Model Predictive Control Scheme and Extremum Seeking Parameter Estimator for Slip Control of Electric Race Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinal slip control system for a rear-wheel-driven electric endurance race car. The control system integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) to optimize the traction and regenerative braking performance of the powertrain. The MPC contains an analytical solution which results in a negligible computation time, whilst providing an optimal solution to a multi-objective optimization problem. The ESC algorithm allows continuous estimation of the optimal slip reference without assuming any prior knowledge of the tire dynamics. Finally, the control parameters are determined using a human-driven preference-based optimization algorithm in order to obtain the desired response. Simulation results and comparisons with other methods demonstrate the system's capability to automatically determine and track the optimal slip values, showing stability and performance under varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of a Hybrid Thermal Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control has gained popularity for its ability to satisfy constraints and guarantee robustness for certain classes of systems. However, for systems whose dynamics are characterized by a high state dimension, substantial nonlinearities, and stiffness, suitable methods for online nonlinear MPC are lacking. One example of such a system is a vehicle thermal management system (TMS) with integrated thermal energy storage (TES), also referred to as a hybrid TMS. Here, hybrid refers to the ability to achieve cooling through a conventional heat exchanger or via melting of a phase change material, or both. Given increased electrification in vehicle platforms, more stringent performance specifications are being placed on TMS, in turn requiring more advanced control methods. In this paper, we present the design and real-time implementation of a nonlinear model predictive controller with 77 states on an experimental hybrid TMS testbed. We show how, in spite of high-dimension and stiff dynamics, an explicit integration method can be obtained by linearizing the dynamics at each time step within the MPC horizon. This integration method further allows the first-order gradients to be calculated with minimal additional computational cost. Through simulated and experimental results, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution method and the benefits of TES for mitigating highly transient heat loads achieved by actively controlling its charging and discharging behavior.</description>

      <title>Stealth Attacks Against Moving Target Defense for Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data injection attacks (DIAs) pose a significant cybersecurity threat to the Smart Grid by enabling an attacker to compromise the integrity of data acquisition and manipulate estimated states without triggering bad data detection procedures. To mitigate this vulnerability, the moving target defense (MTD) alters branch admittances to mismatch the system information that is available to an attacker, thereby inducing an imperfect DIA construction that results in degradation of attack performance. In this paper, we first analyze the existence of stealth attacks for the case in which the MTD strategy only changes the admittance of a single branch. Equipped with this initial insight, we then extend the results to the case in which multiple branches are protected by the MTD strategy. Remarkably, we show that stealth attacks can be constructed with information only about which branches are protected, without knowledge about the particular admittance value changes. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient protection condition for the MTD strategy via graph-theoretic tools that guarantee that the system is not vulnerable to DIAs. Numerical simulations are implemented on IEEE test systems to validate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Quantum Neural Network for Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of renewable energy and load demand requires efficient and accurate solutions for probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF). Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which combine quantum computing and machine learning, offer computational advantages in approximating OPF by effectively handling high-dimensional data. However, adversaries with access to non-private OPF solutions can potentially infer sensitive load demand patterns, raising significant privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving QNN model for probabilistic OPF approximation. By incorporating Gaussian noise into the training process, the learning algorithm achieves ($\varepsilon, \delta$)-differential privacy with theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we develop a strongly entangled quantum state to enhance the nonlinearity expressiveness of the QNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully prevents privacy leakage without compromising the statistical properties of probabilistic OPF. Moreover, compared to classical private neural networks, the QNN reduces the number of parameters by 90% while achieving significantly higher accuracy and greater stability.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Short-Term Distribution System Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electrical load forecasting is crucial for optimizing power system operations, planning, and management. As power systems become increasingly complex, traditional forecasting methods may fail to capture the intricate patterns and dependencies within load data. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful alternatives, offering superior prediction accuracy and the ability to model non-linear and complex temporal relationships. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of prominent ML models: feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, gated recurrent units, and the attention temporal graph convolutional network; for short-term load forecasting of the Energy Corridor distribution system in Houston, Texas. Using a 24-hour look-back window, we train the models on datasets spanning one and five years, to predict the load demand for the next hour and assess performance. Our findings aim to identify the most effective ML approach for accurate load forecasting, contributing to improved grid reliability and system optimization.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Metaverse Construction via Generative AI and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the metaverse has boosted productivity and creativity, driving real-time updates and personalized content, which will substantially increase data traffic. However, current bit-oriented communication networks struggle to manage this high volume of dynamic information, restricting metaverse applications interactivity. To address this research gap, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework for metaverse. Building on an existing metaverse wireless construction task, our proposed GSC framework includes an hourglass network-based (HgNet) encoder to extract semantic information of objects in the metaverse; and a semantic decoder that uses this extracted information to reconstruct the metaverse content after wireless transmission, enabling efficient communication and real-time object behaviour updates to the scenery for metaverse construction task. To overcome the wireless channel noise at the receiver, we design an optimal transport (OT)-enabled semantic denoiser, which enhances the accuracy of metaverse scenery through wireless communication. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional metaverse construction, our proposed GSC framework significantly reduces wireless metaverse construction latency by 92.6\%, while improving metaverse object status accuracy and viewing experience by 45.6\% and 44.7\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Local Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning with Crash Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controller tuning is crucial for closed-loop performance but often involves manual adjustments. Although Bayesian optimization (BO) has been established as a data-efficient method for automated tuning, applying it to large and high-dimensional search spaces remains challenging. We extend a recently proposed local variant of BO to include crash constraints, where the controller can only be successfully evaluated in an a-priori unknown feasible region. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method through simulations and hardware experiments. Our findings showcase the potential of local BO to enhance controller performance and reduce the time and resources necessary for tuning.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Motion Classification in Ankle Exoskeletons Using Surface EMG and IMU Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ankle exoskeletons have garnered considerable interest for their potential to enhance mobility and reduce fall risks, particularly among the aging population. The efficacy of these devices relies on accurate real-time prediction of the user's intended movements through sensor-based inputs. This paper presents a novel motion prediction framework that integrates three Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and eight surface Electromyography (sEMG) sensors to capture both kinematic and muscular activity data. A comprehensive set of activities, representative of everyday movements in barrier-free environments, was recorded for the purpose. Our findings reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) slightly outperform Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on a dataset of five motion tasks, achieving classification accuracies of $96.5 \pm 0.8 \%$ and $87.5 \pm 2.9 \%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's proficiency in transfer learning, enabling accurate motion classification for new subjects using just ten samples per class for finetuning. The robustness of the model is demonstrated by its resilience to sensor failures resulting in absent signals, maintaining reliable performance in real-world scenarios. These results underscore the potential of deep learning algorithms to enhance the functionality and safety of ankle exoskeletons, ultimately improving their usability in daily life.</description>

      <title>NonSysId: A nonlinear system identification package with improved model term selection for NARMAX models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification involves constructing mathematical models of dynamic systems using input-output data, enabling analysis and prediction of system behaviour in both time and frequency domains. This approach can model the entire system or capture specific dynamics within it. For meaningful analysis, it is essential for the model to accurately reflect the underlying system's behaviour. This paper introduces NonSysId, an open-sourced MATLAB software package designed for nonlinear system identification, specifically focusing on NARMAX models. The software incorporates an advanced term selection methodology that prioritises on simulation (free-run) accuracy while preserving model parsimony. A key feature is the integration of iterative Orthogonal Forward Regression (iOFR) with Predicted Residual Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistic-based term selection, facilitating robust model generalisation without the need for a separate validation dataset. Furthermore, techniques for reducing computational overheads are implemented. These features make NonSysId particularly suitable for real-time applications such as structural health monitoring, fault diagnosis, and biomedical signal processing, where it is a challenge to capture the signals under consistent conditions, resulting in limited or no validation data.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Controller Synthesis with Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide lower dimensional representations of complex systems, capturing their salient features while simplifying control design. Building on previous work, this paper presents an overarching framework for the integration of ROMs and control barrier functions, enabling the use of simplified models to construct safety-critical controllers while providing safety guarantees for complex full-order models. To achieve this, we formalize the connection between full and ROMs by defining projection mappings that relate the states and inputs of these models and leverage simulation functions to establish conditions under which safety guarantees may be transferred from a ROM to its corresponding full-order model. The efficacy of our framework is illustrated through simulation results on a drone and hardware demonstrations on ARCHER, a 3D hopping robot.</description>

      <title>Dampening parameter distributional shifts under robust control and gain scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many traditional robust control approaches assume linearity of the system and independence between the system state-input and the parameters of its approximant low-order model. This assumption implies that robust control design introduces no distributional shifts in the parameters of this low-order model. This is generally not true when the underlying actual system is nonlinear, which admits typically state-input coupling with the parameters of the approximating model. Therefore, a robust controller has to be robust under the parameter distribution that will be experienced in the future data, after applying this control, not the parameter distribution seen in the learning data or assumed in the design. In this paper we seek a solution to this problem by restricting the newly designed closed-loop system to be consistent with the learning data and slowing down any distributional shifts in the state-input and parameter spaces. In computational terms, these objectives are formulated as convex semi-definite programs that standard software packages can efficiently solve. We evaluate the proposed approaches on a simple yet telling gain-scheduling problem, which can be equivalently posed as a robust control problem.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Path-integral formula for computation of Koopman eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman Operator and its spectrum has distinct advantages in terms of linear interpretability of the model as well as in analysis and control synthesis through the use of well-studied techniques from linear systems theory. As such, efficient computation of Koopman eigenfunctions is of paramount importance towards enabling such Koopman-based constructions. To this end, several approaches have been proposed in literature, including data-driven, convex optimization, and Deep Learning-based methods. In our recent work, we proposed a novel approach based on path-integrals that allowed eigenfunction computations using a closed-form formula. In this paper, we present several important developments such as finite-time computations, relaxation of assumptions on the distribution of the principal Koopman eigenvalues, as well as extension towards saddle point systems, which greatly enhance the practical applicability of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under Partial shading conditions (PSC), traditional MPPT methods such as, P&amp;O, IncCon and SMC, cannot track down the Global MPP. Thus, the energy conversion of the PV modules will decrease. To overcome this drawback, two evolutionary algorithms; PSO and CS, were presented. Also, the study introduces a hybrid optimization method to enhance the overall performance of the PV system under PSC. MATLAB simulations will be used in order to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Small-signal stability of power systems with voltage droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The small-signal stability of power grids is a well-studied topic. In this work, we give new sufficient conditions for highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters (and other machines) that implement a $V$-$q$ droop to stabilize viable operating states of lossless grids. Assuming the edges are not overloaded, and static voltage limits are satisfied, our conditions are fully local: They can be evaluated bus by bus without information on the rest of the grid. Other than the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, we make no model assumptions. In particular, we do not assume a specific control strategy of the inverters, the number, or type, of their internal degrees of freedom, or that the control is homogeneous throughout the system.
  We achieve this by recasting the dynamics of the nodes as a complex frequency reaction to an active and reactive power signal coming from the grid. By working directly in terms of the node's linearized complex frequency response, the transfer functions capturing the linear response do not depend on arbitrary phases. Further, they are easily interpretable as the frequency/amplitude reaction to active/reactive power imbalance, and correspond directly to the typical design considerations for grid-forming control. By exploiting the presence of the $V$-$q$ droop, we can ensure that the grid's active/reactive power response to a frequency/amplitude change is semi-sectorial. This allows us to use an adapted small phase theorem to obtain local sufficient stability conditions for edges and nodes, which also yields novel results for established control designs.</description>

      <title>Effective Analog ICs Floorplanning with Relational Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog integrated circuit (IC) floorplanning is typically a manual process with the placement of components (devices and modules) planned by a layout engineer. This process is further complicated by the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps, numerous electric and layout-dependent constraints, as well as the high level of customization expected in analog design. This paper presents a novel automatic floorplanning algorithm based on reinforcement learning. It is augmented by a relational graph convolutional neural network model for encoding circuit features and positional constraints. The combination of these two machine learning methods enables knowledge transfer across different circuit designs with distinct topologies and constraints, increasing the \emph{generalization ability} of the solution. Applied to $6$ industrial circuits, our approach surpassed established floorplanning techniques in terms of speed, area and half-perimeter wire length. When integrated into a \emph{procedural generator} for layout completion, overall layout time was reduced by $67.3\%$ with a $8.3\%$ mean area reduction compared to manual layout.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Tube MPC: Learning Tube Dynamics with Massively Parallel Simulation for Robust Safety in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe navigation of cluttered environments is a critical challenge in robotics. It is typically approached by separating the planning and tracking problems, with planning executed on a reduced order model to generate reference trajectories, and control techniques used to track these trajectories on the full order dynamics. Inevitable tracking error necessitates robustification of the nominal plan to ensure safety; in many cases, this is accomplished via worst-case bounding, which ignores the fact that some trajectories of the planning model may be easier to track than others. In this work, we present a novel method leveraging massively parallel simulation to learn a dynamic tube representation, which characterizes tracking performance as a function of actions taken by the planning model. Planning model trajectories are then optimized such that the dynamic tube lies in the free space, allowing a balance between performance and safety to be traded off in real time. The resulting Dynamic Tube MPC is applied to the 3D hopping robot ARCHER, enabling agile and performant navigation of cluttered environments, and safe collision-free traversal of narrow corridors.</description>

      <title>Deep Policy Gradient Methods Without Batch Updates, Target Networks, or Replay Buffers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep policy gradient methods achieve effective performance on simulated robotic tasks, but they all require large replay buffers or expensive batch updates, or both, making them incompatible for real systems with resource-limited computers. We show that these methods fail catastrophically when limited to small replay buffers or during incremental learning, where updates only use the most recent sample without batch updates or a replay buffer. We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method -- Action Value Gradient (AVG) and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods. This advancement enabled us to show for the first time effective deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, employing a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>ChatBCI: A P300 Speller BCI Leveraging Large Language Models for Improved Sentence Composition in Realistic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable renewable generation increases the challenge of balancing power supply and demand. Grid-scale batteries co-located with generation can help mitigate this misalignment. This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for operating grid-scale batteries co-located with solar power. Our results show RL achieves an average of 61% (and up to 96%) of the approximate theoretical optimal (non-causal) operation, outperforming advanced control methods on average. Our findings suggest RL may be preferred when future signals are hard to predict. Moreover, RL has two significant advantages compared to simpler rules-based control: (1) that solar energy is more effectively shifted towards high demand periods, and (2) increased diversity of battery dispatch across different locations, reducing potential ramping issues caused by super-position of many similar actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to conventional RIS, the scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) is non-symmetric, leading to differences in the uplink and the downlink components of NR-RIS cascaded channels. In this paper, a physically-consistent device model is proposed in which an NR-RIS is composed of multiple groups of two-port elements inter-connected by non-reciprocal devices. The resulting non-reciprocal scattering matrix is derived for various cases including two-element groups connected with isolators or gyrators, and general three-element groups connected via circulators. Signal models are given for NR-RIS operating in either reflecting-only or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting modes. The problem of NR-RIS design for non-reciprocal beamsteering is formulated for three-element circulator implementations, and numerical results confirm that non-reciprocal beamsteering can be achieved with minimal sidelobe power. We also show that our physically consistent NR-RIS architecture is effective in implementing channel reciprocity attacks, achieving similar performance to that with idealized NR-RIS models.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Trees: Sample-Efficient Receding Horizon Planning with Reusable Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Model Predictive Trees (MPT), a receding horizon tree search algorithm that improves its performance by reusing information efficiently. Whereas existing solvers reuse only the highest-quality trajectory from the previous iteration as a "hotstart", our method reuses the entire optimal subtree, enabling the search to be simultaneously guided away from the low-quality areas and towards the high-quality areas. We characterize the restrictions on tree reuse by analyzing the induced tracking error under time-varying dynamics, revealing a tradeoff between the search depth and the timescale of the changing dynamics. In numerical studies, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art sampling-based cross-entropy methods with hotstarting. We demonstrate our planner on an autonomous vehicle testbed performing a nonprehensile manipulation task: pushing a target object through an obstacle field. Code associated with this work will be made available at https://github.com/jplathrop/mpt.</description>

      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Reaction Networks using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a chemical reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, a modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>

      <title>Stability properties of gradient flow dynamics for the symmetric low-rank matrix factorization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric low-rank matrix factorization serves as a building block in many learning tasks, including matrix recovery and training of neural networks. However, despite a flurry of recent research, the dynamics of its training via non-convex factorized gradient-descent-type methods is not fully understood especially in the over-parameterized regime where the fitted rank is higher than the true rank of the target matrix. To overcome this challenge, we characterize equilibrium points of the gradient flow dynamics and examine their local and global stability properties. To facilitate a precise global analysis, we introduce a nonlinear change of variables that brings the dynamics into a cascade connection of three subsystems whose structure is simpler than the structure of the original system. We demonstrate that the Schur complement to a principal eigenspace of the target matrix is governed by an autonomous system that is decoupled from the rest of the dynamics. In the over-parameterized regime, we show that this Schur complement vanishes at an $O(1/t)$ rate, thereby capturing the slow dynamics that arises from excess parameters. We utilize a Lyapunov-based approach to establish exponential convergence of the other two subsystems. By decoupling the fast and slow parts of the dynamics, we offer new insight into the shape of the trajectories associated with local search algorithms and provide a complete characterization of the equilibrium points and their global stability properties. Such an analysis via nonlinear control techniques may prove useful in several related over-parameterized problems.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Stability of Gradient Descent: A Discrete-Time Passivity-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a discrete-time passivity-based analysis of the gradient descent method for a class of functions with sector-bounded gradients. Using a loop transformation, it is shown that the gradient descent method can be interpreted as a passive controller in negative feedback with a very strictly passive system. The passivity theorem is then used to guarantee input-output stability, as well as the global convergence, of the gradient descent method. Furthermore, provided that the lower and upper sector bounds are not equal, the input-output stability of the gradient descent method is guaranteed using the weak passivity theorem for a larger choice of step size. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of this passivity-based analysis, a new variation of the gradient descent method with variable step size is proposed by gain-scheduling the input and output of the gradient.</description>

      <title>USRP-Based Single Anchor Positioning: AoA with 5G Uplink Signals, and UWB Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel testbed designed for 5th-Generation (5G) positioning using Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs). The testbed integrates multiple units: an Operation Unit for test management, a User Unit equipped with an Ettus E312 USRP, and a Station Unit featuring an Ettus N310 USRP equipped with a three-element Uniform Linear Array for Angle of Arrival estimation. Alongside ultra wideband ranging, the testbed estimates the user's position relative to the base station. Signal processing algorithms are executed in a dedicated processing unit. Key challenges addressed include phase misalignment between RX channel pairs due to different Local Oscillators in the Ettus N310, necessitating real-time calibration for precise signal alignment. High sampling rates (up to 61.44 MSps) result in large IQ sample files, managed efficiently using a snapshot technique to optimize storage without compromising testbed positioning capabilities. The testbed synchronizes angular measurements with ranging estimates allowing consistent performance evaluation for real-life cases of dynamic users (e.g. pedestrian). Experimental results demonstrate the testbed's effectiveness in achieving accurate pedestrian user localization.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Decision-making for COLREGs and the Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), devising decision-making and obstacle avoidance solutions that address maritime COLREGs (Collision Regulations), primarily defined for human operators, has long been a pressing challenge. Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.</description>

      <title>Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation Methods of Dynamic Model Identification for Harbor Maneuvers using Feedforward Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic model for an automatic berthing and unberthing controller has to estimate harbor maneuvers, which include berthing, unberthing, approach maneuvers to berths, and entering and leaving the port. When the dynamic model is estimated by the system identification, a large number of tests or trials are required to measure the various motions of harbor maneuvers. However, the amount of data that can be obtained is limited due to the high costs and time-consuming nature of full-scale ship trials. In this paper, we improve the generalization performance of the dynamic model for the automatic berthing and unberthing controller by introducing data augmentation. This study used slicing and jittering as data augmentation methods and confirmed their effectiveness by numerical experiments using the free-running model tests. The dynamic model is represented by a neural network-based model in numerical experiments. Results of numerical experiments demonstrated that slicing and jittering are effective data augmentation methods but could not improve generalization performance for extrapolation states of the original dataset.</description>

      <title>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both decision-independent uncertainty (DIU) and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse re-dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to DIUs in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed adaptive data-driven chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. Key factors impacting GES's capacity credit are discussed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</description>

      <title>Real-world validation of safe reinforcement learning, model predictive control and decision tree-based home energy management systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning based energy management approaches, specifically reinforcement learning with a safety layer (OptLayerPolicy) and a metaheuristic algorithm generating a decision tree control policy (TreeC), have shown promise. However, their effectiveness has only been demonstrated in computer simulations. This paper presents the real-world validation of these methods, comparing against model predictive control and simple rule-based control benchmark. The experiments were conducted on the electrical installation of 4 reproductions of residential houses, which all have their own battery, photovoltaic and dynamic load system emulating a non-controllable electrical load and a controllable electric vehicle charger. The results show that the simple rules, TreeC, and model predictive control-based methods achieved similar costs, with a difference of only 0.6%. The reinforcement learning based method, still in its training phase, obtained a cost 25.5\% higher to the other methods. Additional simulations show that the costs can be further reduced by using a more representative training dataset for TreeC and addressing errors in the model predictive control implementation caused by its reliance on accurate data from various sources. The OptLayerPolicy safety layer allows safe online training of a reinforcement learning agent in the real-world, given an accurate constraint function formulation. The proposed safety layer method remains error-prone, nonetheless, it is found beneficial for all investigated methods. The TreeC method, which does require building a realistic simulation for training, exhibits the safest operational performance, exceeding the grid limit by only 27.1 Wh compared to 593.9 Wh for reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed control algorithms are known to reduce overall computation time compared to centralized control algorithms. However, they can result in inconsistent solutions leading to the violation of safety-critical constraints. Inconsistent solutions can arise when two or more agents compute concurrently while making predictions on each others control actions. To address this issue, we propose an iterative algorithm called Synchronization-Based Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control, which we presented in [1]. The algorithm consists of two steps: 1. computing the optimal control inputs for each agent and 2. synchronizing the predicted states across all agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in the control of multiple small-scale vehicles in our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty in the aging of batteries in battery electric vehicles impacts both the daily driving range as well as the expected economic lifetime. This paper presents a method to determine online the capacity and internal resistance of a battery cell based on real-world data. The method, based on a Joint Extended Kalman Filter combined with Recursive Least Squares, is computationally efficient and does not a priori require a fully characterized cell model. Offline simulation of the algorithm on data from differently aged cells shows convergence of the algorithm and indicates that capacity and resistance follow the expected trends. Furthermore, the algorithm is tested online on a Hardware-in-the-Loop setup to demonstrate real-time parameter updates in a realistic driving scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable. This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous, empowering various fields, especially integrating artificial intelligence and traditional science (AI for Science: Artificial intelligence for science), which has attracted widespread attention. In AI for Science, using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve partial differential equations (AI for PDEs: Artificial intelligence for partial differential equations) has become a focal point in computational mechanics. The core of AI for PDEs is the fusion of data and partial differential equations (PDEs), which can solve almost any PDEs. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the research on AI for PDEs, summarizing the existing algorithms and theories. The article discusses the applications of AI for PDEs in computational mechanics, including solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and biomechanics. The existing AI for PDEs algorithms include those based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Energy Methods (DEM), Operator Learning, and Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO). AI for PDEs represents a new method of scientific simulation that provides approximate solutions to specific problems using large amounts of data, then fine-tuning according to specific physical laws, avoiding the need to compute from scratch like traditional algorithms. Thus, AI for PDEs is the prototype for future foundation models in computational mechanics, capable of significantly accelerating traditional numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constructive RNNs: An Error-Recurrence Perspective on Time-Variant Zero Finding Problem Solving Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When facing time-variant problems in analog computing, the desirable RNN design requires finite-time convergence and robustness with respect to various types of uncertainties, due to the time-variant nature and difficulties in implementation. It is very worthwhile to explore terminal zeroing neural networks, through examining and applying available attracting laws. In this paper, from a control-theoretic point of view, an error recurrence system approach is presented by equipping with uncertainty compensation in the pre-specified error dynamics, capable of enhancing robustness properly. Novel rectifying actions are designed to make finite-time settling so that the convergence speed and the computing accuracy of time-variant computing can be improved. Double-power and power-exponential rectifying actions are respectively formed to construct specific models, while the particular expressions of settling time function for the former are presented, and for the latter the proximate settling-time estimations are given, with which the fixed-time convergence of the corresponding models is in turn established. Moreover, the uncertainty compensation by the signum/smoothing-signum techniques are adopted for finite-duration stabilization. Theoretical results are presented to demonstrate effectiveness (involving fixed-time convergence and robustness) of the proposed computing schemes for the time-variant QP problem solving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proprietary closed-source software is still the norm in advanced process control. Transparency and reproducibility are key aspects of scientific research. Free and open-source toolkit can contribute to the development, sharing and advancement of new and efficient control approaches, and the industrial sector will certainly benefit from them. This paper presents ModelPredictiveControl.jl, an open-source software package for designing model predictive controllers in the Julia programming language. It is designed to be easy to use and modular, while providing advanced features like nonlinear control and moving horizon estimation. It relies on powerful control system and mathematical optimization frameworks to simplify the construction and testing of state estimators and predictive controllers. It also integrates with the standard plotting library to quickly visualize closed-loop data. The paper presents the main functionalities and illustrates them with two case studies in simulation. The first example is a continuously stirred tank reactor described by linear dynamics. The second one implements a nonlinear, an economic, and a successive linearization model predictive controllers for an inverted pendulum.

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Models for Nonlinear Distributed Control: An Unconstrained Parametrization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of large-scale cyber-physical systems requires optimal distributed policies relying solely on limited communication with neighboring agents. However, computing stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems while optimizing complex costs remains a significant challenge. Neural Networks (NNs), known for their expressivity, can be leveraged to parametrize control policies that yield good performance. However, NNs' sensitivity to small input changes poses a risk of destabilizing the closed-loop system. Many existing approaches enforce constraints on the controllers' parameter space to guarantee closed-loop stability, leading to computationally expensive optimization procedures. To address these problems, we leverage the framework of port-Hamiltonian systems to design continuous-time distributed control policies for nonlinear systems that guarantee closed-loop stability and finite $\mathcal{L}_2$ or incremental $\mathcal{L}_2$ gains, independent of the optimzation parameters of the controllers. This eliminates the need to constrain parameters during optimization, allowing the use of standard techniques such as gradient-based methods. Additionally, we discuss discretization schemes that preserve the dissipation properties of these controllers for implementation on embedded systems. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed controllers is demonstrated through consensus control of non-holonomic mobile robots subject to collision avoidance and averaged voltage regulation with weighted power sharing in DC microgrids.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Neyman-Pearson Detection to Combat Strategic Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz constant estimation for general neural network architectures using control tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the estimation of the Lipschitz constant of general neural network architectures using semidefinite programming. For this purpose, we interpret neural networks as time-varying dynamical systems, where the $k$-th layer corresponds to the dynamics at time $k$. A key novelty with respect to prior work is that we use this interpretation to exploit the series interconnection structure of feedforward neural networks with a dynamic programming recursion. Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures. To show the versatility and computational advantages of our method, we apply it to different neural network architectures trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for data-driven rock mass classification: addressing limitations in existing systems using drilling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design. However, these systems, developed primarily in the 1970s, lack access to modern high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their effectiveness as decision-support systems. We outline these limitations and describe how a data-driven system, based on drilling data, can overcome them. Using statistical information extracted from thousands of MWD-data values in one-meter sections of a tunnel profile, acting as a signature of the rock mass, we demonstrate that well-defined clusters can form a foundational basis for various classification systems. Representation learning was used to reduce the dimensionality of 48-value vectors via a nonlinear manifold learning technique (UMAP) and linear principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) clustered the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. Domain knowledge improved clustering by adding extra features to core MWD-data clusters. We structured and correlated these clusters with physical rock properties, including rock type and quality, and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial potential for future classification systems using this objective, data-driven methodology, minimising human bias.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>Accelerated forward-backward and Douglas-Rachford splitting dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of continuous-time variants of accelerated Forward-Backward (FB) and Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithms for nonsmooth composite optimization problems. When the objective function is given by the sum of a quadratic and a nonsmooth term, we establish accelerated sublinear and exponential convergence rates for convex and strongly convex problems, respectively. Moreover, for FB splitting dynamics, we demonstrate that accelerated exponential convergence rate carries over to general strongly convex problems. In our Lyapunov-based analysis we exploit the variable-metric gradient interpretations of FB and DR splittings to obtain smooth Lyapunov functions that allow us to establish accelerated convergence rates. We provide computational experiments to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>Willems' Fundamental Lemma for Nonlinear Systems with Koopman Linear Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory and Willems' fundamental lemma both can provide (approximated) data-driven linear representation for nonlinear systems. However, choosing lifting functions for the Koopman operator is challenging, and the quality of the data-driven model from Willems' fundamental lemma has no guarantee for general nonlinear systems. In this paper, we extend Willems' fundamental lemma for a class of nonlinear systems that admit a Koopman linear embedding. We first characterize the relationship between the trajectory space of a nonlinear system and that of its Koopman linear embedding. We then prove that the trajectory space of Koopman linear embedding can be formed by a linear combination of rich-enough trajectories from the nonlinear system. Combining these two results leads to a data-driven representation of the nonlinear system, which bypasses the need for the lifting functions and thus eliminates the associated bias errors. Our results illustrate that both the width (more trajectories) and depth (longer trajectories) of the trajectory library are important to ensure the accuracy of the data-driven model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of the sixth generation of communication networks (6G) has been gaining momentum over the past years, with a target of being introduced by 2030. Several initiatives worldwide are developing innovative solutions and setting the direction for the key features of these networks. Some common emerging themes are the tight integration of AI, the convergence of multiple access technologies and sustainable operation, aiming to meet stringent performance and societal requirements. To that end, we are introducing REASON - Realising Enabling Architectures and Solutions for Open Networks. The REASON project aims to address technical challenges in future network deployments, such as E2E service orchestration, sustainability, security and trust management, and policy management, utilising AI-native principles, considering multiple access technologies and cloud-native solutions.
  This paper presents REASON's architecture and the identified requirements for future networks. The architecture is meticulously designed for modularity, interoperability, scalability, simplified troubleshooting, flexibility, and enhanced security, taking into consideration current and future standardisation efforts, and the ease of implementation and training. It is structured into four horizontal layers: Physical Infrastructure, Network Service, Knowledge, and End-User Application, complemented by two vertical layers: Management and Orchestration, and E2E Security. This layered approach ensures a robust, adaptable framework to support the diverse and evolving requirements of 6G networks, fostering innovation and facilitating seamless integration of advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Cornering Control and Real-Vehicle Deployment for Autonomous Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Executing drift maneuvers during high-speed cornering presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, yet offers the potential to minimize turning time and enhance driving dynamics. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8). Notably, this study is the first to deploy and apply an RL-based transient drift cornering algorithm on consumer-grade electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. This paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which discretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.

      <title>A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>

      <title>Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.</description>
