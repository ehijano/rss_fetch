      <title>A converse theorem for Borcherds products in signature $(2,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a modular unit on two copies of the upper half-plane is a Borcherds product if and only if its boundary divisor is a special boundary divisor. Therefore, we define a subspace of the space of invariant vectors for the Weil representation which maps surjectively onto the space of modular units that are Borcherds products. Moreover, we show that every boundary divisor of a Borcherds product can be obtained in this way. As a byproduct we obtain new identities of eta products.</description>

      <title>Splitting and expliciting the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, together with a quasi-isomorphism with the direct sum of its (shifted) cohomology groups.</description>

      <title>Simple bounds for the auxiliary function of Riemann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give simple numerical bounds for $\zeta(s)$, $\vartheta(s)$, $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$, $Z(t)$, for use in the numerical computation of these functions.
  The purpose of the paper is to give bounds for several functions needed in the calculation of $\zeta(s)$ and $Z(t)$. We are not pretending to have any originality. Our object is to be useful as a reference in our work for simple (simple to compute and simple to check) bounds.</description>

      <title>The second moment of the $GL_3$ standard $L$-function on the critical line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a strong bound on the second moment of the $GL_3$ standard $L$-function on the critical line. The method builds on the recent work of Aggarwal, Leung, and Munshi which treated shorter intervals. We deduce some corollaries including an improvement on the error term in the Rankin-Selberg problem, and on certain subconvexity bounds for $GL_3 \times GL_2$ and $GL_3$ $L$-functions. As a byproduct of the method of proof, we also obtain an estimate for an average of shifted convolution sums of $GL_3$ Fourier coefficients.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic $L$-function and Iwasawa Main Conjecture for an Artin motive over a CM field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an algebraic Hecke character defined on a CM field $F$ of degree $2d$, Katz constructed a $p$-adic $L$-function of $d+1+\delta_{F,p}$ variables in his innovative paper published in 1978, where $\delta_{F,p}$ denotes the Leopoldt defect for $F$ and $p$. In the present article, we generalise the result of Katz under several technical conditions (containing the absolute unramifiedness of $F$ at $p$), and construct a $p$-adic Artin $L$-function of $d+1+\delta_{F,p}$ variables, which interpolates critical values of the Artin $L$-function associated to a $p$-unramified Artin representation of the absolute Galois group $G_F$. Our construction is an analogue over a CM field of Greenberg's construction over a totally real field, but there appear new difficulties which do not matter in Greenberg's case.</description>

      <title>On close fields and the local Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Fargues-Scholze's semisimplified local Langlands correspondence (for quasisplit groups) with $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-coefficients is compatible with Deligne and Kazhdan's philosophy of close fields. From this, we deduce that the same holds with $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-coefficients after restricting to wild inertia, addressing questions of Gan-Harris-Sawin and Scholze. The proof involves constructing a moduli space of nonarchimedean local fields and then extending Fargues-Scholze's work to this context.</description>

      <title>On some conjectural determinants of Sun involving residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$ and integers $d, k, m$ with gcd$(p,d)=1$ and $2\leq k\leq \frac{p-1}{2}$, we consider the determinant
  \begin{equation*}
  S_{m,k}(d,p) = \left|(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)^m\right|_{1 \leq i,j \leq \frac{p-1}{k}},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\alpha_i$ are distinct $k$-th power residues modulo $p$. In this paper, we deduce some residue properties for the determinant $S_{m,k}(d,p)$ as a generalization of certain results of Sun. Using these, we further prove some conjectures of Sun related to $$\left(\frac{\sqrt{S_{1+\frac{p-1}{2},2}(-1,p)}}{p}\right) \text{ and } \left(\frac{\sqrt{S_{3+\frac{p-1}{2},2}(-1,p)}}{p}\right).$$ In addition, we investigate the number of primes $p$ such that $p\ |\ S_{m+\frac{p-1}{k},k}(-1,p)$, and confirm another conjecture of Sun related to $S_{m+\frac{p-1}{2},2}(-1,p)$.</description>

      <title>The Functors $\mathcal{F}^G_P$ over Local Fields of Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field. In the $p$-adic setting, Orlik-Strauch constructed functors from the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ associated to the Lie algebra of $G$ to the category of locally analytic representation of $G$. We generalize these functors to such groups over non-archimedean local fields of arbitrary characteristic. To this end, we introduce the hyperalgebra of a non-archimedean Lie group $G$, which generalizes its Lie algebra, and consider topological modules over the algebra of locally analytic distributions on $G$ and subalgebras related to this hyperalgebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n \geq 2$, define $t_n$ to be the smallest number such that the additive energy $E(A)$ of any subset $A \subset \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$ and any $d$ is at most $|A|^{t_n}$. Trivially we have $t_n \leq 3$ and $$ t_n \geq 3 - \log_n\frac{3n^3}{2n^3+n} $$ by considering $A = \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$. In this note, we investigate the behavior of $t_n$ for large $n$ and obtain the following non-trivial bounds: $$ 3 - (1+o_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1)) \log_n \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \leq t_n \leq 3 - \log_n(1+c), $$ where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Old Meets New: Connecting Two Infinite Families of Congruences Modulo Powers of 5 for Generalized Frobenius Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2012 Paule and Radu proved a difficult family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for Andrews' 2-colored generalized Frobenius partition function. The family is associated with the classical modular curve of level 20. We demonstrate the existence of a congruence family for a related generalized Frobenius partition function associated with the same curve. We construct an isomorphism between this new family and the original family of congruences via a mapping on the associated rings of modular functions. The pairing of the congruence families provides a new strategy for future work on congruences associated with modular curves of composite level. We show how a similar approach can be made to multiple other recent examples in the literature. We also give some important insights into the behavior of these congruence families with respect to the Atkin--Lehner involution which proved very important in Paule and Radu's original proof.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>

      <title>The Explicit Hypergeometric-Modularity Method I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theories of hypergeometric functions and modular forms are highly intertwined. For example, particular values of truncated hypergeometric functions and hypergeometric character sums are often congruent or equal to Fourier coefficients of modular forms. In this series of papers, we develop and explore an explicit "Hypergeometric-Modularity" method for associating a modular form to a given hypergeometric datum. In particular, for certain length three and four hypergeometric data we give an explicit method for finding a modular form $f$ such that the corresponding hypergeometric Galois representation has a subrepresentation isomorphic to the Deligne representation of $f$. Our method utilizes Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases, commutative formal group laws, and supercongruences. As a byproduct, we give a collection of eta quotients with multiplicative coefficients constructed from hypergeometric functions. In the second paper, we discuss a number of applications, including explicit connections between hypergeometric values and periods of these explicit eta quotients as well as evaluation formulae for certain special $L$-values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jacobian is an algebraic invariant of a graph which is often seen in analogy to the class group of a number field. In particular, there have been multiple investigations into the Iwasawa theory of graphs with the Jacobian playing the role of the class group. In this paper, we construct an Iwasawa module related to the Jacobian of a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower of connected graphs, and give examples where we use this to compute asymptotic sizes of the Jacobians in this tower.</description>

      <title>The shifted prime-divisor function over shifted primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we denote by $\omega_a^*(n)$ the number of shifted-prime divisors $p-a$ of $n$, where $p&gt;a$ is prime. In this paper, we study the moments of $\omega_a^*$ over shifted primes $p-b$. Specifically, we prove an asymptotic formula for the first moment and upper and lower bounds of the correct order of magnitude for the second moment. These results suggest that the average behavior of $\omega^*_a$ on shifted primes is similar to its average behavior on natural numbers. We shall also prove upper bounds for the mean values of sub-multiplicative functions in a nice class over the least common multiples of the shifted primes $p-a$ and $q-b$. Such upper bounds are intimately related to the second moments of $\omega^*_a$ over natural numbers and over shifted primes. Finally, we propose a new conjecture on the second moment of $\omega_1^*$ over natural numbers and provide a heuristic argument in support of this conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^4+ax^3+d\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$, where $ad\ne 0$. Let $C_n$ denote the cyclic group of order $n$, $D_4$ the dihedral group of order 8, and $A_4$ the alternating group of order 12. Assuming that $f(x)$ is monogenic, we give necessary and sufficient conditions involving only $a$ and $d$ to determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$. In particular, we show that $G=D_4$ if and only if $(a,d)=(\pm 2,2)$, and that $G\not \in \{C_4,C_2\times C_2\}$. Furthermore, we prove that $f(x)$ is monogenic with $G=A_4$ if and only if $a=4k$ and $d=27k^4+1$, where $k\ne 0$ is an integer such that $27k^4+1$ is squarefree. This article extends previous work of the authors on the monogenicity of quartic polynomials and their Galois groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.12880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Euclidean pure point diffractive Delone sets of finite local complexity and with uniform patch frequencies it is well known that the patch counting entropy computed along the closed centred balls is zero. We consider such sets in the setting of sigma-compact locally compact Abelian groups and show that the topological entropy of the associated Delone dynamical system is zero. For this we provide a suitable version of the variational principle. We furthermore construct counterexamples, which show that the patch counting entropy of such sets can be non-zero in this context. Other counterexamples will show that the patch counting entropy of such a set can not be computed along a limit and even be infinite in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Chai's conjecture on the additivity of the base change conductor of semiabelian varieties in the case of Jacobians of proper curves. This includes the first infinite family of non-trivial wildly ramified examples. Along the way, we extend Raynaud's construction of the N\'eron lft-model of a Jacobian in terms of the Picard functor to arbitrary seminormal curves (beyond which Jacobians admit no N\'eron lft-models, as shown by our more general structural results). Finally, we investigate the structure of Jacobians of (not necessarily geometrically reduced) proper curves over fields of degree of imperfection at most one and prove two conjectures about the existence of N\'eron models and N\'eron lft-models due to Bosch-L\"utkebohmert-Raynaud for Jacobians of general proper curves in the case of perfect residue fields, thus strengthening the author's previous results in this situation.</description>
