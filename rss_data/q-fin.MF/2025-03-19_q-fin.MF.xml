      <title>On weak notions of no-arbitrage in a 1D general diffusion market with interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish deterministic necessary and sufficient conditions for the no-arbitrage notions "no increasing profit" (NIP), "no strong arbitrage" (NSA) and "no unbounded profit with bounded risk" (NUPBR) in one-dimensional general diffusion markets. These are markets with one risky asset, which is modeled as a regular continuous strong Markov process that is also a semimartingale, and a riskless asset that grows exponentially at a constant rate $r\in \mathbb{R}$. All deterministic criteria are provided in terms of the scale function and the speed measure of the risky asset process. Our study reveals a variety of surprising effects. For instance, irrespective of the interest rate, NIP is not excluded by reflecting boundaries or an irregular scale function. In the case of non-zero interest rates, it is even possible that NUPBR holds in the presence of reflecting boundaries and/or skew thresholds. In the zero interest rate regime, we also identify NSA as the minimal no arbitrage notion that excludes reflecting boundaries and that forces the scale function to be continuously differentiable with strictly positive absolutely continuous derivative, meaning that it is of the same form as for a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Collective completeness and pricing hedging duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on "Collective Arbitrage and the Value of Cooperation" by Biagini et al. (2025, forthcoming in "Finance and Stochastics"), which introduced in discrete time the notions of collective arbitrage and super-replication in a multi-agent market framework, where agents may operate in several submarkets and collaborate through risk exchange mechanisms. Expanding on these foundations, we establish a First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and a collective pricing-hedging duality under different assumptions and with new techniques compared to Biagini et al. (2025). We further introduce the notion of collective replication in order to study collective market completeness and provide a Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing in this cooperative multi-agent setting.</description>

      <title>Capturing Smile Dynamics with the Quintic Volatility Model: SPX, Skew-Stickiness Ratio and VIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the two-factor Quintic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, where volatility is modeled as a polynomial of degree five based on the sum of two Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by the same Brownian Motion, each mean-reverting at a different speed. We demonstrate that the Quintic model effectively captures the volatility surfaces of SPX and VIX while aligning with the skew-stickiness ratio (SSR) across maturities ranging from a few days to over two years. Furthermore, the Quintic model shows consistency with key empirical stylized facts, notably reproducing the Zumbach effect.</description>

      <title>Existence of Optimal Contracts for Principal-Agent Problem with Drift Control and Quadratic Effort Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of optimal contracts of the principal-agent problem is a long-standing problem. According to the general framework in Cvitani\'c et al. [2], this existence can be derived from the existence of a classical solution to a degenerated fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation problem. In this work we consider the simple case with drift control and quadratic cost function, then prove the existence of classical solution to that PDE.</description>
