      <title>Impartial Selection with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.</description>

      <title>Desirable Effort Fairness and Optimality Trade-offs in Strategic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic learning studies how decision rules interact with agents who may strategically change their inputs/features to achieve better outcomes. In standard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to learn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that agents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align exclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external effects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of certain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the principal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across heterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e., maximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the principal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that captures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal dependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others; (2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning, through which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical guarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular desirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness measures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort.</description>

      <title>Autobidding Arena: unified evaluation of the classical and RL-based autobidding algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL) autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.</description>

      <title>Comparing Uniform Price and Discriminatory Multi-Unit Auctions through Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as $\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively. However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences: uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as $\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand, and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Achievable Quotas in Multiwinner Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Justified representation (JR) and extended justified representation (EJR) are well-established proportionality axioms in approval-based multiwinner voting. Both axioms are always satisfiable, but they rely on a fixed quota (typically Hare or Droop), with the Droop quota being the smallest one that guarantees existence across all instances. With this observation in mind, we take a first step beyond the fixed-quota paradigm and introduce proportionality notions where the quota is instance-dependent. We demonstrate that all commonly studied voting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of $\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our instance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of $\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\alpha$-JR is NP-complete. To address this, we introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for computing committees that satisfy $\alpha$-JR, and we provide positive results in the voter interval (VI) and candidate interval (CI) domains.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Ties: Approximation Ratios and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study matching markets with ties, where workers on one side of the market may have tied preferences over jobs, determined by their matching utilities. Unlike classical two-sided markets with strict preferences, no single stable matching exists that is utility-maximizing for all workers. To address this challenge, we introduce the \emph{Optimal Stable Share} (OSS)-ratio, which measures the ratio of a worker's maximum achievable utility in any stable matching to their utility in a given matching. We prove that distributions over only stable matchings can incur linear utility losses, i.e., an $\Omega (N)$ OSS-ratio, where $N$ is the number of workers. To overcome this, we design an algorithm that efficiently computes a distribution over (possibly non-stable) matchings, achieving an asymptotically tight $O (\log N)$ OSS-ratio. When exact utilities are unknown, our second algorithm guarantees workers a logarithmic approximation of their optimal utility under bounded instability. Finally, we extend our offline approximation results to a bandit learning setting where utilities are only observed for matched pairs. In this setting, we consider worker-optimal stable regret, design an adaptive algorithm that smoothly interpolates between markets with strict preferences and those with statistical ties, and establish a lower bound revealing the fundamental trade-off between strict and tied preference regimes.</description>

      <title>Structural aspects of the Student Project Allocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Student Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students (SPA-S), which involves the assignment of students to projects based on student preferences over projects, lecturer preferences over students, and capacity constraints on both projects and lecturers. The goal is to find a stable matching that ensures no student and lecturer can mutually benefit by deviating from a given assignment to form an alternative arrangement involving some project. We explore the structural properties of SPA-S and characterise the set of stable matchings for an arbitrary SPA-S instance. We prove that, similar to the classical Stable Marriage problem (SM) and the Hospital Residents problem (HR), the set of all stable matchings in SPA-S forms a distributive lattice. In this lattice, the student-optimal and lecturer-optimal stable matchings represent the minimum and maximum elements, respectively. Finally, we introduce meta-rotations in the SPA-S setting using illustrations, demonstrating how they capture the relationships between stable matchings. These novel structural insights paves the way for efficient algorithms that address several open problems related to stable matchings in SPA-S.</description>

      <title>The Meta-rotation Poset for Student-Project Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Student Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students (SPA-S), an extension of the well-known Stable Marriage and Hospital Residents problem. In this model, students have preferences over projects, each project is offered by a single lecturer, and lecturers have preferences over students. The goal is to compute a stable matching which is an assignment of students to projects (and thus to lecturers) such that no student or lecturer has an incentive to deviate from their current assignment. While motivated by the university setting, this problem arises in many allocation settings where limited resources are offered by agents with their own preferences, such as in wireless networks.
  We establish new structural results for the set of stable matchings in SPA-S by developing the theory of meta-rotations, a generalisation of the well-known notion of rotations from the Stable Marriage problem. Each meta-rotation corresponds to a minimal set of changes that transforms one stable matching into another within the lattice of stable matchings. The set of meta-rotations, ordered by their precedence relations, forms the meta-rotation poset. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of stable matchings and the closed subsets of the meta-rotation poset. By developing this structure, we provide a foundation for the design of efficient algorithms for enumerating and counting stable matchings, and for computing other optimal stable matchings, such as egalitarian or minimum-cost matchings, which have not been previously studied in SPA-S.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Correlated Equilibria in Generalized Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated equilibria -- and their generalization $\Phi$-equilibria -- are a fundamental object of study in game theory, offering a more tractable alternative to Nash equilibria in multi-player settings. While computational aspects of equilibrium computation are well-understood in some settings, fundamental questions are still open in generalized games, that is, games in which the set of strategies allowed to each player depends on the other players' strategies. These classes of games model fundamental settings in economics and have been a cornerstone of economics research since the seminal paper of Arrow and Debreu [1954]. Recently, there has been growing interest, both in economics and in computer science, in studying correlated equilibria in generalized games. It is known that finding a social welfare maximizing correlated equilibrium in generalized games is NP-hard. However, the existence of efficient algorithms to find any equilibrium remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this question negatively, showing that this problem is PPAD-complete.</description>

      <title>A Principled Approach to Randomized Selection under Uncertainty: Applications to Peer Review and Grant Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items; examples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and investment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or deliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the items deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and uncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such deterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving explicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in practice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we prove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval estimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient Randomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the worst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty represented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max intervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an interpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method scales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic properties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically compare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate that MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility under fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while outperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case formulation.</description>

      <title>Inference of Altruism and Intrinsic Rewards in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human interactions are influenced by emotions, temperament, and affection, often conflicting with individuals' underlying preferences. Without explicit knowledge of those preferences, judging whether behaviour is appropriate becomes guesswork, leaving us highly prone to misinterpretation. Yet, such understanding is critical if autonomous agents are to collaborate effectively with humans. We frame the problem with multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning and show that even a simple model, where agents weigh their own welfare against that of others, can cover a wide range of social behaviours. Using novel Bayesian techniques, we find that intrinsic rewards and altruistic tendencies can be reliably identified by placing agents in different groups. Crucially, this disentanglement of intrinsic motivation from altruism enables the synthesis of new behaviours aligned with any desired level of altruism, even when demonstrations are drawn from restricted behaviour profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction (CMRA) is a new auction format used in recent European spectrum auctions. We show that an auction-specific version of truthful bidding leads to an efficient allocation. We then characterize different ex-post equilibria that feature truthful bidding, demand expansion, and demand reduction. The truthtelling equilibrium is fragile to small asymmetries in the bidders' caps. Moreover, if bidders are sufficiently symmetric, the CMRA is vulnerable to risk-free collusion. We propose an alternative activity rule that prevents such collusive strategies while keeping other equilibria intact. We discuss outcomes of several Danish CMRAs in light of our equilibrium predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study popularity for matchings under preferences. This solution concept captures matchings that do not lose against any other matching in a majority vote by the agents. A popular matching is said to be robust if it is popular among multiple instances. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether there exists a robust popular matching if instances only differ with respect to the preferences of a single agent. The same method applies also to dominant matchings, a subclass of maximum-size popular matchings. By contrast, we obtain NP-completeness if two instances differ only by two agents of the same side or by a swap of two adjacent alternatives by two agents. The first hardness result applies to dominant matchings as well. Moreover, we find another complexity dichotomy based on preference completeness for the case where instances differ by making some options unavailable. We conclude by discussing related models, such as strong and mixed popularity.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Time-Aware Fairness in Data Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios. Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>
