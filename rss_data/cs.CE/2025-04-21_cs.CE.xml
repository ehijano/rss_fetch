      <title>CardioFit: A WebGL-Based Tool for Fast and Efficient Parameterization of Cardiac Action Potential Models to Fit User-Provided Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac action potential models allow examination of a variety of cardiac dynamics, including how behavior may change under specific interventions. To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over half a century, the computer mouse has been the primary tool for interacting with digital data, yet it remains a limiting factor in exploring complex, multi-scale scientific images. Traditional 2D visualization methods hinder intuitive analysis of inherently 3D structures. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a transformative alternative, providing immersive, interactive environments that enhance data comprehension. This article introduces ASCRIBE-VR, a VR platform of Autonomous Solutions for Computational Research with Immersive Browsing \&amp; Exploration, which integrates AI-driven algorithms with scientific images. ASCRIBE-VR enables multimodal analysis, structural assessments, and immersive visualization, supporting scientific visualization of advanced datasets such as X-ray CT, Magnetic Resonance, and synthetic 3D imaging. Our VR tools, compatible with Meta Quest, can consume the output of our AI-based segmentation and iterative feedback processes to enable seamless exploration of large-scale 3D images. By merging AI-generated results with VR visualization, ASCRIBE-VR enhances scientific discovery, bridging the gap between computational analysis and human intuition in materials research, connecting human-in-the-loop with digital twins.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models Meet Financial Data Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on extracting meaningful signals from diverse financial data sources, including candlestick charts, order statistics on put and canceled orders, traded volume data, limit order books, and news flow. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in processing unstructured data and has significantly advanced natural language processing, its application to structured financial data remains an ongoing challenge. This study investigates the integration of deep learning models with financial data modalities, aiming to enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization. We present a novel approach to incorporating limit order book analysis into algorithmic trading by developing embedding techniques and treating sequential limit order book snapshots as distinct input channels in an image-based representation. Our methodology for processing limit order book data achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-frequency trading algorithms, underscoring the effectiveness of deep learning in financial applications.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin's Edge: Embedded Sentiment in Blockchain Transactional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns, and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data. Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available, transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its price movement.</description>

      <title>Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>

      <title>Transformer Encoder and Multi-features Time2Vec for Financial Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</description>

      <title>ProteinGPT: Multimodal LLM for Protein Property Prediction and Structure Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires a detailed analysis of protein structures and functions, a task that is inherently complex and time-consuming in traditional protein research. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we constructed a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins, each annotated with 20-30 property tags and 5-10 QA pairs per protein, and optimized the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. Experiments demonstrate that ProteinGPT effectively generates informative responses to protein-related questions, achieving high performance on both semantic and lexical metrics and significantly outperforming baseline models and general-purpose LLMs in understanding and responding to protein-related queries. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ProteinGPT/ProteinGPT.</description>
