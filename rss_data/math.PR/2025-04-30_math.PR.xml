      <title>On optimal error rates for strong approximation of SDEs with a H\"older continuous drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article we study strong approximation of solutions of scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with bounded and $\alpha$-H\"older continuous drift coefficient and constant diffusion coefficient at time point $1$. Recently, it was shown in [arXiv:1909.07961v4 (2021)] that for such SDEs the equidistant Euler scheme achieves an $L^p$-error rate of at least $(1+\alpha)/2$, up to an arbitrary small $\varepsilon$, for all $p\geq 1$ and all $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion $W$. In this article we prove a matching lower error bound for $\alpha\in(0, 1)$. More precisely, we show that for every $\alpha\in(0, 1)$, the $L^p$-error rate $(1+\alpha)/2$ of the Euler scheme in [arXiv:1909.07961v4 (2021)] can not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely many evaluations of $W$ at fixed time points. Up to now, this result was known in the literature only for $\alpha=1$.
  Additionally, we extend a result from [arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] on sharp lower errror bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with a bounded drift coefficient of fractional Sobolev regularity $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and constant diffusion coefficient at time point $1$. We prove that for every $\alpha\in (0,1)$, the $L^p$-error rate $ (1 + \alpha)/2$ that was shown in [arXiv:2101.12185v2 (2022)] for the equidistant Euler scheme can, up to a logarithmic term, not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely many evaluations of W at fixed time points. This result was known from [arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] only for $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$ and $p=2$.
  For the proof of these lower bounds we use variants of the Weierstrass function as a drift coefficient and we employ the coupling of noise technique recently introduced in [arXiv:2010.00915v1 (2020)].</description>

      <title>The number of particles at sublinear distances from the tip in branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a branching Brownian motion (BBM). It is well known that the rightmost particle is located near $ m_t = \sqrt{2} t - \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} \log t $. Let $N(t,x) $ be the number of particles within distance $ x $ from $ m_t $, where $ x = o(t/\log(t)) $ grows with $ t $. We prove that $ N(t,x)/\pi^{-1/2}xe^{\sqrt{2}x} e^{-x^2/(2t)} $ converges in probability to $Z_\infty$ and note that, for $ x \leq t^{1/3} $, the convergence cannot be strengthened to an almost sure result. Moreover, the intermediate steps in our proof provide a path localisation for the trajectories of particles in $ N(t,x) $ and their genealogy, allowing us to develop a picture of the BBM front at sublinear distances from $ m_t $.</description>

      <title>Exponential moments of truncated branching random walk martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a branching random walk that drifts to infinity, consider its Malthusian martingale, i.e.~the additive martingale with parameter $\theta$ being the smallest root of the characteristic equation. When particles are killed below the origin, we show that the limit of this martingale admits an exponential tail, contrary to the case without killing, where the tail is polynomial. In the critical case, where the characteristic equation has a single root, the same holds for the (truncated) derivative martingale, as we show. This study is motivated by recent work on first passage percolation on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.</description>

      <title>Flowshop Machine Scheduling: Markov Modeling, Optimal Schedules and Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flowshop machine scheduling has been of main interest in several applications where the timing of its processes plays a fundamental role in the utilization of system resources. Addressing the optimal sequencing of the jobs when equivalent failures across machines exist is a decision of particular relevance to the general scheduling problem. Such failures allow for unpredictable time consumption and improper utilization of the machines. Therefore, it is of particular relevance to address the problem with new modeling approaches considering the parallel and sequential components of the manufacturing process under equivalent failure in the jobs at each machine. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain to model the N/ M/P/F permutation flowshop. We analyze the time cost encountered due to M consecutive machine equivalent failures in processing N jobs. We derive new closed form expressions of the completion time under such setup. We extend the Markov model into its underlying components, providing another new Markov model with processes that dont encounter failures and compare both systems. We provide new insights on job ordering decision rules and new approaches in a set of proposed algorithms that provide novel optimal and heuristic methods that provides optimal or near optimal schedules. We derive closed form expressions that divide per machine CT and per machine processing and waiting times. Further, we provide a novel scheme that proves intimate connections between such time components and the maximum number of rounds per machine that allows optimal utilization of the machines in one CT.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Gaussians in the Hellinger-Kantorovich-Boltzmann gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study leverages the basic insight that the gradient-flow equation associated with the relative Boltzmann entropy, in relation to a Gaussian reference measure within the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, preserves the class of Gaussian measures. This invariance serves as the foundation for constructing a reduced gradient structure on the parameter space characterizing Gaussian densities. We derive explicit ordinary differential equations that govern the evolution of mean, covariance, and mass under the HK-Boltzmann gradient flow. The reduced structure retains the additive form of the HK metric, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics involved.
  We explore the geodesic convexity of the reduced system, revealing that global convexity is confined to the pure transport scenario, while a variant of sublevel semi-convexity is observed in the general case. Furthermore, we demonstrate exponential convergence to equilibrium through Polyak-Lojasiewicz-type inequalities, applicable both globally and on sublevel sets. By monitoring the evolution of covariance eigenvalues, we refine the decay rates associated with convergence. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-Gaussian targets exhibiting strong log-lambda-concavity, corroborating our theoretical results with numerical experiments that encompass a Gaussian-target gradient flow and a Bayesian logistic regression application.</description>

      <title>The relative entropy of primes in arithmetic progressions is really small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a modulus $q$. One would expect the number of primes in each invertible residue class mod $q$ to be multinomially distributed, i.e. for each $p \,\mathrm{mod}\, q$ to behave like an independent random variable uniform on $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^\times$. Using techniques from data science, we discover overwhelming evidence to the contrary: primes are much more uniformly distributed than iid uniform random variables. This phenomenon was previously unknown, and there is no clear theoretical explanation for it.
  To demonstrate that our test statistic of choice, the KL divergence, is indeed extreme, we prove new bounds for the left tail of the relative entropy of the uniform multinomial using the method of types.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Fair Division: Chores Are Easier Than Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dividing items among agents, two of the most widely studied fairness notions are envy-freeness and proportionality. We consider a setting where $m$ chores are allocated to $n$ agents and the disutility of each chore for each agent is drawn from a probability distribution. We show that an envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that $m \ge 2n$, and moreover, $m$ must be at least $n+\Theta(n)$ in order for the existence to hold. On the other hand, we prove that a proportional allocation is likely to exist as long as $m = \omega(1)$, and this threshold is asymptotically tight. Our results reveal a clear contrast with the allocation of goods, where a larger number of items is necessary to ensure existence for both notions.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969). In this work, we develop a new approach towards effectivising the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods extend to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unimodality of the number of paths per length on polytopes: Examples, counter-examples, and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To solve a linear program, the simplex method follows a path in the graph of a polytope, on which a linear function increases. The length of this path is an key measure of the complexity of the simplex method. Numerous previous articles focused on the longest paths, or, following Borgwardt, computed the average length of a path for certain random polytopes. We detail more precisely how this length is distributed, i.e., how many paths of each length there are.
  It was conjectured by De Loera that the number of paths counted according to their length forms a unimodal sequence. We give examples (old and new) for which this holds; but we disprove this conjecture by constructing counterexamples for several classes of polytopes. However, De Loera is "statistically correct": We prove that the length of coherent paths on a random polytope (with vertices chosen uniformly on a sphere) admits a central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20753v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new operator for certain types of ultrametric Cantor sets is constructed using the measure coming from the spectral triple associated with the Cantor set, as well as its zeta function. Under certain mild conditions on that measure, it is shown that it is an integral operator similar to the Vladimirov-Taibleson operator on the p-adic integers. Its spectral properties are studied, and the Markov property and kernel representation of the heat kernel generated by this so-called \emph{Vladimirov-Pearson} operator is shown, viewed as acting on a certain Sobolev space. A large class of these operators have a heat kernel and a Green function explicitly given by the ultrametric wavelets on the Cantor set, which are eigenfunctions of the operator.</description>

      <title>Freezing Phase Transitions for Lattice Systems and Higher-Dimensional Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X = \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$, where $d \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set, equipped with the action of the shift map. For a given continuous potential $\phi: \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta&gt;0$ (``inverse temperature''), there exists a (nonempty) set of equilibrium states $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. The potential $\phi$ is said to exhibit a ``freezing phase transition'' if $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) = \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for all $\beta, \beta' &gt; \beta_c$, while $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) \neq \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for any $\beta &lt; \beta_c &lt; \beta'$, where $\beta_c\in (0,\infty)$ is a critical inverse temperature depending on $\phi$. In this paper, given any proper subshift $X_0$ of $X$, we explicitly construct a continuous potential $\phi: X \to \mathbb{R}$ for which there exists $\beta_c \in (0,\infty)$ such that $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$ coincides with the set of measures of maximal entropy on $X_0$ for all $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, whereas for all $\beta &lt; \beta_c$, $\mu(X_0)=0$ for all $\mu\in \mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. This phenomenon was previously studied only for $d = 1$ in the context of dynamical systems and for restricted classes of subshifts, with significant motivation stemming from quasicrystal models. Additionally, we prove that under a natural summability condition -- satisfied, for instance, by finite-range potentials or exponentially decaying potentials -- freezing phase transitions are impossible.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Stein operators: a noncommutative algebra perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we make a novel connection between Stein's method and noncommutative algebra by viewing polynomial Stein operators (Stein operators with polynomial coefficients) as elements of the first Weyl algebra. Through this connection we study the algebraic structure of classes of polynomial Stein operators. In the case of the standard Gaussian distribution, we provide a complete description of the corresponding class of polynomial Stein operators by (i) identifying it as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ with an explicit given basis and (ii) by showing that this class is a principal right ideal of the first Weyl algebra generated by the classical Gaussian Stein operator $\partial -x$, with $\partial$ denoting the usual differential operator. We also study the characterising property of polynomial Stein operators for the standard Gaussian distribution, and give examples of general classes of polynomial Stein operators that are characterising, as well as classes that are not characterising unless additional distributional assumptions are made. By appealing to a standard property of Weyl algebras, we shown that the non-characterising property possessed by a wide class of polynomial Stein operators for the standard Gaussian distribution is a consequence of a general result that is perhaps surprising from a probabilistic perspective: the intersection between the class of polynomial Stein operators for any two target distributions with holonomic densities or holonomic characteristic functions is non-trivial.</description>

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are one of the most popular classes of algorithms for sampling from a target probability distribution. A rising trend in recent years consists in analyzing the convergence of MCMC algorithms using tools from the theory of large deviations. In (Milinanni &amp; Nyquist, 2024), a new framework based on this approach has been developed to study the convergence of empirical measures associated with algorithms of Metropolis-Hastings type, a broad and popular sub-class of MCMC methods.
  The goal of this paper is to leverage these large deviation results to improve the efficiency of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Specifically, we use the large deviations rate function (a central object in large deviation theory) to quantify and characterize the algorithms' speed of convergence. We begin by extending the analysis from (Milinanni &amp; Nyquist, 2024), deriving alternative representations of the rate function. Building on this, we establish explicit upper and lower bounds, which we then use to design schemes to tune Metropolis-Hastings algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we realize the half-steps of a general class of Markov chains as alternating projections with respect to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between convex sets of joint probability distributions. Using this characterization, we provide a geometric proof of an information-theoretic duality between the Markov chains defined by the even and odd half-steps of the alternating projection scheme.</description>

      <title>Outlier eigenvalues for full rank deformed single ring random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n \times n$ deterministic matrix and $\Sigma_n$ be a deterministic non-negative matrix such that $A_n$ and $\Sigma_n$ converge in $*$-moments to operators $a$ and $\Sigma$ respectively in some $W^*$-probability space. We consider the full rank deformed model $A_n + U_n \Sigma_n V_n,$ where $U_n$ and $V_n$ are independent Haar-distributed random unitary matrices. In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues of $A_n + U_n\Sigma_n V_n$ in two domains that are outside the support of the Brown measure of $a +u \Sigma$. We give a sufficient condition to guarantee that outliers are stable in one domain, and we also prove that there are no outliers in the other domain. When $A_n$ has a bounded rank, the first domain is exactly the one outside the outer boundary of the single ring, and the second domain is the inner disk of the single ring. Our results generalize the results of Benaych-Georges and Rochet (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiclass processor-sharing queue with feedback. Jobs arrive according to renewal processes, and service times follow general distributions. Upon service completion, jobs may either depart the system or re-enter as a different class according to a probabilistic, Jackson-like routing mechanism. Under heavy-traffic conditions, we establish a diffusion approximation for a measure-valued process tracking the residual service times of jobs.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [11] and [12, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inviscid 2D Boussinesq equations driven by rough transport noise of Kraichnan type with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$. For all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of probabilistic strong solutions for all $L^p$ initial vorticity and $L^2$ initial temperature, under the parameter constraint $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 1-1/(p\wedge 2)$. The key ingredient is the anomalous regularity due to the noise proven by Coghi and Maurelli \cite{CogMau} who dealt with stochastic 2D Euler equations. Combining techniques from analysis and probability, we demonstrate how the additional regularity from noise compensates the singularity due to the nonlinear parts and coupled terms.</description>

Abstract: Private signals model noisy information about an unknown state. Although these signals are called "private," they may still carry information about each other. Our paper introduces the concept of private private signals, which contain information about the state but not about other signals. To achieve privacy, signal quality may need to be sacrificed. We study the informativeness of private private signals and characterize those that are optimal in the sense that they cannot be made more informative without violating privacy. We discuss implications for privacy in recommendation systems, information design, causal inference, and mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, Correlation and Competition in Ergodic N-player Games and Mean-field Games of Singular Controls: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of $N$-player games and mean-field games of singular controls with ergodic performance criterion, providing a benchmark case for irreversible investment games featuring mean-field interaction and strategic complementarities. The state of each player follows a geometric Brownian motion, controlled additively through a nondecreasing process, while agents seek to maximize a long-term average reward functional with a power-type instantaneous profit, under strategic complementarity. We explore three different notions of optimality, which, in the mean-field limit, correspond to the mean-field control solution, mean-field coarse correlated equilibria, and mean-field Nash equilibria. We explicitly compute equilibria in the three cases and compare them numerically, in terms of yielded payoffs and existence conditions. Finally, we show that the mean-field control and mean-field equilibria can approximate the cooperative and competitive equilibria, respectively, in the corresponding $N$-player game when $N$ is sufficiently large. Our analysis of the mean-field control problem features a novel Lagrange multiplier approach, which proves crucial in establishing the approximation result, while the treatment of mean-field coarse correlated equilibria necessitates a new, specifically tailored definition for the stationary setting.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ and let $I(S) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)}\int_{S} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Inj}(x)^2 \wedge 1} dx$, where $\mathrm{Inj}(x)$ is the injectivity radius at $x$. We prove that for any $k\in \{1,\ldots, 2g-3\}$, the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ of the Laplacian satisfies \begin{equation*}
  \lambda_k \geq \frac{c k^2}{I(S) g^2} \, , \end{equation*} where $c&gt;0$ is some universal constant. We use this bound to prove the heat kernel estimate \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \int_S \Big| p_t(x,x) -\frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \Big | ~dx \leq C \sqrt{ \frac{I(S)}{t}} \qquad \forall t \geq 1 \, , \end{equation*} where $C&lt;\infty$ is some universal constant. These bounds are optimal in the sense that for every $g\geq 2$ there exists a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ satisfying the reverse inequalities with different constants.</description>

      <title>Evolution of weights on a connected finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a connected finite graph, we propose an evolution of weights including Ollivier's Ricci flow as a special case. During the evolution process, on each edge, the speed of change of weight is exactly the difference between the Wasserstein distance related to two probability measures and certain graph distance. Here the probability measure may be chosen as an $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk, an $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk, or a general probability measure. Based on the ODE theory, we show that the initial value problem has a unique global solution.
  A discrete version of the above evolution is applied to the problem of community detection. Our algorithm is based on such a discrete evolution, where probability measures are chosen as $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk and $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk respectively. Note that the later measure has not been used in previous works [2, 16, 21, 24]. Here, as in [21], only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. Moreover, our algorithm is much easier than those of [2, 16, 21], which were all based on Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature. The code is available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Evolution-of-weights-on-a-connected-finite-graph.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

Abstract: We study the capacity of the power-constrained additive Gaussian channel with an entropy constraint at the input. In particular, we characterize this capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime at small entropy. This follows as a corollary of the following general result on a moment matching problem: We show that for any continuous random variable with finite moments, the largest number of initial moments that can be matched by a discrete random variable of sufficiently small but positive entropy is three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of uniformly random permutation representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. Consider the composition of a uniformly random element of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,S_n)$ with the $(n-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_n$. We prove the strong convergence in probability as $n\to\infty$ of this sequence of random representations to the regular representation of $\Gamma$.
  As a consequence, for any closed hyperbolic surface $X$, with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ covering space of $X$ has near optimal relative spectral gap -- ignoring the eigenvalues that arise from the base surface $X$.
  To do so, we show that the polynomial method of proving strong convergence can be extended beyond rational settings.
  To meet the requirements of this extension we prove two new kinds of results. First, we show there are effective polynomial approximations of expected values of traces of elements of $\Gamma$ under random homomorphisms to $S_n$. Secondly, we estimate the growth rates of probabilities that a finitely supported random walk on $\Gamma$ is a proper power after a given number of steps.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mean-field particle Monte Carlo method for simulating the N-body Lindblad equation. We provide a convergence result showing that a system of interacting particles converges to the corresponding nonlinear Lindblad equation in the large N limit.</description>
