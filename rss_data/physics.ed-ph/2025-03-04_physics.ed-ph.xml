      <title>Astrof\'isica Observacional e Ensino de F\'isica Moderna: Uma Abordagem Conceitual da Espectroscopia Astron\^omica</title>

Abstract: Continuing professional development for teachers in the physical sciences is crucial to maintaining high-quality instruction, especially when addressing modern physics. Nevertheless, the teaching of these topics often relies on theoretical models that may seem abstract and removed from practical applications. In this context, research in astrophysics provides many valuable insights into the nature of light and its fundamental properties, such as continuous and discrete spectra, blackbody radiation, and atomic orbitals. This paper, aimed at both high school and university-level physics teachers, examines the peculiarities of the emission and absorption spectra of various types of astronomical objects and demonstrates how spectroscopy is applied in astrophysics research. From this perspective, the study conceptually illustrates how astrophysicists, by measuring light spectra, determine the composition, physical properties, origin, and evolution of celestial bodies and, by extension, of the universe as a whole. By understanding not only the theory but also the direct applications of astronomical spectroscopy, teachers will be better prepared to guide their students, thereby showcasing the true value of modern physics in the real world.</description>

      <title>A Stimulus-Response Model for Explaining When Students Decide to Engage in a Physics Task: The TSMS-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a testable model for physics-specific student engagement at the onset of task processing in response to a task-specific motivational stimulus. Empirical research provides evidence that contextual embedding of a task and interactions between cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational processes influence students' engagement and reasoning in physics tasks. The Task-Specific Motivational Stimulus (TSMS) Model integrates research from motivational psychology and dual process theory of reasoning. It describes how the feeling of rightness (FOR) and feeling of difficulty (FOD) that accompany the heuristically constructed first impression mental model of task type (FIMM) can shape situational expectancy x value estimations. During task typification, general physics-specific self-efficacy beliefs and test-related costs are specified for the task at hand, resulting in a task-specific motivational stimulus: the weighted estimated probability for solving the task (WEPST). The intensity of the WEPST determines the probability that students decide to engage in physics-specific analytic reasoning processes for task representation rather than simply relying on the probably incorrect first impression mental model of the task. We discuss the usefulness and validity of the TSMS model, its practical and theoretical contribution, its transferability to tasks in other domains, and propose hypotheses for testing the model.</description>

      <title>Global Blind Spot in Understanding Trigonometric Derivatives: A Multinational Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonometric derivatives are fundamental in both mathematics and physics, yet their proper application, particularly the distinction between radians and degrees, poses a significant challenge for college students globally. This study identifies a widespread "blind spot" in understanding trigonometric derivatives and their implications for physical systems, highlighting a critical gap in physics education. A multinational survey of 769 college students, primarily undergraduate and graduate STEM majors, from Israel, the United States, China, and India assessed their ability to differentiate between radians and degrees in mathematical and physical contexts, focusing on harmonic motion. Results reveal that only 26.3\% of students correctly identified that the well-known expressions for trigonometric derivatives hold exclusively in radians, while 70.7\% incorrectly assumed both radians and degrees are valid. Notably, students demonstrated improved recognition of radians in physical contexts (59.0\% correct responses) compared to mathematical ones, suggesting that students rely on familiar physical equations as cognitive reference points when applying mathematical concepts. These misunderstandings appear worldwide, suggesting a universal challenge. The findings highlight the need for curriculum reforms to better connect mathematical formalism with physical application.</description>

      <title>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect and the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</description>
