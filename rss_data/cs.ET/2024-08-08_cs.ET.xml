      <title>C-Nash: A Novel Ferroelectric Computing-in-Memory Architecture for Solving Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Nash equilibrium (NE), pivotal within game theory, has garnered widespread attention across numerous industries. Recent advancements introduced several quantum Nash solvers aimed at identifying pure strategy NE solutions (i.e., binary solutions) by integrating slack terms into the objective function, commonly referred to as slack-quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (S-QUBO). However, incorporation of slack terms into the quadratic optimization results in changes of the objective function, which may cause incorrect solutions. Furthermore, these quantum solvers only identify a limited subset of pure strategy NE solutions, and fail to address mixed strategy NE (i.e., decimal solutions), leaving many solutions undiscovered. In this work, we propose C-Nash, a novel ferroelectric computing-in-memory (CiM) architecture that can efficiently handle both pure and mixed strategy NE solutions. The proposed architecture consists of (i) a transformation method that converts quadratic optimization into a MAX-QUBO form without introducing additional slack variables, thereby avoiding objective function changes; (ii) a ferroelectric FET (FeFET) based bi-crossbar structure for storing payoff matrices and accelerating the core vector-matrix-vector (VMV) multiplications of QUBO form; (iii) A winner-takes-all (WTA) tree implementing the MAX form and a two-phase based simulated annealing (SA) logic for searching NE solutions. Evaluations show that C-Nash has up to 68.6% increase in the success rate for identifying NE solutions, finding all pure and mixed NE solutions rather than only a portion of pure NE solutions, compared to D-Wave based quantum approaches. Moreover, C-Nash boasts a reduction up to 157.9X/79.0X in time-to-solutions compared to D-Wave 2000 Q6 and D-Wave Advantage 4.1, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spatial Affordance-aware Interactable Subspace Allocation for Mixed Reality Telepresence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable remote Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) clients to collaborate as if they were in the same space during Mixed Reality (MR) telepresence, it is essential to overcome spatial heterogeneity and generate a unified shared collaborative environment by integrating remote spaces into a target host space. Especially when multiple remote users connect, a large shared space is necessary for people to maintain their personal space while collaborating, but the existing simple intersection method leads to the creation of narrow shared spaces as the number of remote spaces increases. To robustly align to the host space even as the number of remote spaces increases, we propose a spatial affordance-aware interactable subspace allocation algorithm. The key concept of our approach is to consider the perceivable and interactable areas separately, where every user views the same mutual space, but each remote user has a different interactable subspace, considering their location and spatial affordance. We conducted an evaluation with 900 space combinations, varying the number of remote spaces as two, four, and six, and results show our method outperformed in securing wide interactable mutual space and instantiating users compared to the other spatial matching methods. Our work enables multiple clients from diverse remote locations to access the AR host's space, allowing them to interact directly with the table, wall, or floor by aligning their physical subspaces within a connected mutual space.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Contrastive Graph Clustering Network via Structural Information Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering, a classical task in graph learning, involves partitioning the nodes of a graph into distinct clusters. This task has applications in various real-world scenarios, such as anomaly detection, social network analysis, and community discovery. Current graph clustering methods commonly rely on module pre-training to obtain a reliable prior distribution for the model, which is then used as the optimization objective. However, these methods often overlook deeper supervised signals, leading to sub-optimal reliability of the prior distribution. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep graph clustering method called CGCN. Our approach introduces contrastive signals and deep structural information into the pre-training process. Specifically, CGCN utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to foster information interoperability among multiple modules and allows the model to adaptively adjust the degree of information aggregation for different order structures. Our CGCN method has been experimentally validated on multiple real-world graph datasets, showcasing its ability to boost the dependability of prior clustering distributions acquired through pre-training. As a result, we observed notable enhancements in the performance of the model.</description>

      <title>Towards Less Greedy Quantum Coalition Structure Generation in Induced Subgraph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to 100% renewable energy requires new techniques for managing energy networks, such as dividing them into sensible subsets of prosumers called micro-grids. Doing so in an optimal manner is a difficult optimization problem, as it can be abstracted to the Coalition Structure Generation problem in Induced Subgraph Games, a NP-complete problem which requires dividing an undirected, complete, weighted graph into subgraphs in a way that maximizes the sum of their internal weights. Recently, Venkatesh et al. (arXiv:2212.11372) published a Quantum Annealing (QA)-based iterative algorithm called GCS-Q, which they claim to be the best currently existing solver for the problem in terms of runtime complexity. As this algorithm makes the application of QA to the problem seem promising, but is a greedy one, this work proposes several less greedy QA-based approaches and investigates whether any of them can outperform GCS-Q in terms of solution quality. While we find that this is not the case yet on D-Wave hardware, most of them do when using the classical QBSolv software as a solver. Especially an algorithm we call 4-split iterative R-QUBO shows potential here, finding all optima in our dataset while scaling favorably with the problem size in terms of runtime. Thus, it appears to be interesting for future research on quantum approaches to the problem, assuming QA hardware will become more noise-resilient over time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Storage for Efficient Key Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing discourse surrounding integrating QKD networks as a service for critical infrastructures, key storage design often receives insufficient attention. Nonetheless, it bears crucial significance as it profoundly impacts the efficiency of QKD network services, thereby shaping its suitability for diverse applications. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of key storage designs developed through practical testbeds and propose a novel key storage design to increase the effectiveness of key creation and supply. All key storage designs underwent analysis using network simulation tools, and the findings demonstrate that the novel key storage design surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Behavioral Test Cases For Natural Language Processing Using Clustering and Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in behavioral testing for natural language processing (NLP) models, such as Checklist, is inspired by related paradigms in software engineering testing. They allow evaluation of general linguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness and identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The current packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires domain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to develop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It clusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply prompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-known Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral test profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths of those models.</description>
