      <title>Shakespeare, Entropy and Educated Monkeys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has often been said, correctly, that a monkey forever randomly typing on a keyboard would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. Almost just as often it has been pointed out that this "eventually" is well beyond any conceivably relevant time frame. We point out that an educated monkey that still types at random but is constrained to only write "statistically typical" text, would produce any given passage in a much shorter time. Information theory gives a very simple way to estimate that time. For example, Shakespeare's phrase, Better three hours too soon than a minute too late, from The Merry Wives of Windsor, would take the educated monkey only 73 thousand years to produce, compared to the beyond-astronomical $2.7 \times 10^{63}$ years for the randomly typing one. Despite the obvious improvement, it would still take the educated monkey an unimaginably long $10^{42,277}$ years to produce all of Hamlet.</description>

      <title>Fourier Restriction: From Linear Restriction to Multilinear Restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation studies the Fourier restriction, which is to find the range of the constants p, q such that the L^q norm on a chosen subset of the Fourier domain is bounded above by the L^p norm in a spacial domain, up to some constant that is independent of the function. We discuss linear restriction, including Hausdorff-Young's inequality, A proof of the restriction estimate on curves, and further discussions on the restriction problem on the sphere and paraboloid via the Stein-Tomas argument. We then discuss bilinear restriction, where the estimate on 2-dimensional case is proved by the reverse square function estimate and the bilinear interaction of transverse wave packets. The result is further used to verify the restriction conjecture on the 2-dimensional paraboloid. We discuss about multi-linear restriction in the final section, focusing on a short proof of a close result of the multilinear restriction estimate from I. Bejenaru.</description>

      <title>\"Uber Nichts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of Nothing from both philosophical and mathematical perspectives, distinguishing between absolute non-being (nihil) and relational negation as a principle of difference. It explores how mathematics formalizes absence through two fundamental concepts: the number zero and the empty set. The text traces the historical evolution of zero from a positional marker in Babylonian systems to an independent algebraic entity in Indian mathematics, emphasizing its structural roles as a neutral and absorbing element. Parallel to this, the empty set is analyzed not as a void, but as an existing axiomatic object that serves as the foundation for constructing the number system in modern set theory. Furthermore, the operational utility of active nothing is demonstrated through its role in algebraic manipulation -- such as adding zero to reveal structure -- and in physical conservation laws. Finally, drawing on the philosophy of Nikolaus von Kues and the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, the paper interprets mathematics as a free, creative act of the human mind emerging ex nihilo.</description>

      <title>Early Highlights in the History of the Bernstein-von Mises Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The designation ``Bernstein-von Mises theorem'' is apparently due to Lucien Le Cam. Roughly, the assertion of this theorem states that the posterior distribution of a parameter, conditioned on a large sample, is approximately normal, independent of a particular prior. The present paper discusses important steps in the development of this theorem and its applications, from Laplace in 1774 to Le Cam in 1953. Regarding Bernstein and his disciple Neyman, it thereby relies on sources which were widely unknown and hard to obtain until recently.</description>

      <title>Is there Ethics in Mathematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a critical response to some arguments and general recommendations presented in a discussion paper Four Levels of Ethical Engagement [EiM Discussion Paper 1/2018 University of Cambridge Ethics in Mathematics Project, https://www.ethics-in-mathematics.com/assets/dp/18 1.pdf] by Maurice Chiodo and Piers Bursill-Hall. Much in their article is based on certain observations about characteristic psychological traits of mathematicians and their patterns of behavior that I find to be in stark contrast to my own observations. I argue against their assumptions and conclusions using examples.</description>
