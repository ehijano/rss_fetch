      <title>Permutation extropy: a time series complexity measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On account of a greater need for understanding the complexity of time series like physiological time series, financial time series, and many more that enter into picture for their inculpation with real-world problems, several complexity parameters have already been proposed in the literature. Permutation entropy, Lyapunov exponents are such complexity parameters out of many. In this article, we introduce a new time series complexity parameter, that is, the permutation extropy. The failure of permutation entropy in correctly specifying complexity of some chaotic time series motivates us to come up with a better complexity parameter, hence we propose this permutation extropy measure. We try to combine the ideas behind the permutation entropy and extopy to construct this measure. We also validate our proposed measure using several chaotic maps like logistic map, Henon map and Burger map. We apply the proposed complexity parameter to study the complexity of financial time series of the stock market and time series constructed using WHO data, finding a better complexity specification than permutation entropy. The proposed measure is kind of robust, fast calculation and invariant with respect to monotonous nonlinear transformation like permutation entropy, but it gives us a better result in specifying complexity in some cases.</description>

      <title>A Fokker-Planck-Based Loss Function that Bridges Dynamics with Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have derived a novel loss function from the Fokker-Planck equation that links dynamical system models with their probability density functions, demonstrating its utility in model identification and density estimation. In the first application, we show that this loss function can enable the extraction of dynamical parameters from non-temporal datasets, including timestamp-free measurements from steady non-equilibrium systems such as noisy Lorenz systems and gene regulatory networks. In the second application, when coupled with a density estimator, this loss facilitates density estimation when the dynamic equations are known. For density estimation, we propose a density estimator that integrates a Gaussian Mixture Model with a normalizing flow model. It simultaneously estimates normalized density, energy, and score functions from both empirical data and dynamics. It is compatible with a variety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and score matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network, where the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to sparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density estimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid data manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule, facilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a principled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between dynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that clarify the underlying theoretical intuitions.</description>

      <title>A model for dynamical systems with strange attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a system with one degree of freedom that models a class of dynamical systems with strange attractors in three dimensions. This system retains all the characteristics of chaotic attractors and is expressed by a second-order integro-differential equation which mimics a spring-like problem. We determine the potential energy, the rate of change of the kinetic energy of this system, and show that is self-oscillating.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and averaging in partially hyperbolic systems with fast and slow variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of dynamical systems obtained by coupling an Anosov map on the two-dimensional torus -- the chaotic system -- with the identity map on the one-dimensional torus -- the neutral system -- through a dissipative interaction. We show that the two systems synchronize: the trajectories evolve toward an attracting invariant manifold, and the full dynamics is conjugated to its linearization around the invariant manifold. As a byproduct, we obtain that there exists a unique exponentially mixing physical measure. When the interaction is small, the evolution of the variable which describes the neutral system is very close to the identity; hence, it appears as a slow variable with respect to the variable which describes the chaotic system, and which is wherefore named the fast variable. We demonstrate that, seen on a suitably long time scale, the slow variable effectively follows the solution of a deterministic differential equation obtained by averaging over the fast variable. More precisely, we prove that the invariant manifold is in probability close to the fixed point of the averaged dynamics and that the difference between the exact evolution of the slow variable, seen from the invariant manifold, and its averaged evolution is in probability exponentially decreasing for arbitrarily large times.</description>

      <title>{ComplexityMeasures.jl}: scalable software to unify and accelerate entropy and complexity timeseries analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the nonlinear timeseries analysis literature, countless quantities have been presented as new ``entropy'' or ``complexity'' measures, often with similar roles. The ever-increasing pool of such measures makes creating a sustainable and all-encompassing software for them difficult both conceptually and pragmatically. Such a software however would be an important tool that can aid researchers make an informed decision of which measure to use and for which application, as well as accelerate novel research. Here we present {ComplexityMeasures.jl}, an easily extendable and highly performant open-source software that implements a vast selection of complexity measures. The software provides 1638 measures with 3,841 lines of source code, averaging only 2.3 lines of code per exported quantity (version 3.7). This is made possible by its mathematically rigorous composable design. In this paper we discuss the software design and demonstrate how it can accelerate complexity-related research in the future. We carefully compare it with alternative software and conclude that {ComplexityMeasures.jl} outclasses the alternatives in several objective aspects of comparison, such as computational performance, overall amount of measures, reliability, and extendability. {ComplexityMeasures.jl} is also a component of the {DynamicalSystems.jl} library for nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear timeseries analysis and follows open source development practices for creating a sustainable community of developers and contributors.</description>
