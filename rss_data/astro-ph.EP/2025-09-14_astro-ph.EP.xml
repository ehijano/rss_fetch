      <title>Precise Constraints on the Energy Budget of WASP-121 b from its JWST NIRISS/SOSS Phase Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.</description>

      <title>The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS). VII. Statistical comparison with the HARPS/Coralie survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems.

      <title>Dynamically New Comet C/2025 D1 (Groeller) with Record Perihelion Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.</description>

      <title>Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is quickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit resonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter its rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation becomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into play and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet by its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system and can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the angular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no dependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It is applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to the cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific planet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its hypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and Charon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution scenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether Pluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more compact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit -- a topic to be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to exoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the possibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered.</description>

      <title>A massive primordial atmosphere on early Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars finished forming while the solar nebula was still present, and acquired its primordial atmosphere from this reservoir. The absence of a detectable cometary xenon signature in the present-day Martian atmosphere suggests that the capture of solar nebular gas was significant enough to dilute later cometary contributions. By quantifying the mass of cometary material efficiently retained on Mars, we place a lower bound on the mass of the primordial Martian atmosphere. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we use cometary bombardment data from two independent studies conducted within a solar system evolutionary model consistent with its current structure. Our calculations show that, even under the most conservative scenario, the minimal mass of the primordial martian atmospheres would yield a surface pressure of no less than 2.9 bar. Such a massive nebular envelope is consistent with recent models in which atmospheric capture is strongly enhanced by the presence of heavier species on Mars - due to outgassing or redox buffering with a magma ocean.</description>

      <title>A four-planet system orbiting the old thick disk star TOI-1203</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-1203 is a bright (V=8.6) G3 V star known to host a transiting warm sub-Neptune on a 25.5 d orbit. Here we report on an intensive high-precision radial velocity and photometric follow-up campaign carried out with the HARPS spectrograph and the CHEOPS space telescope. We found that TOI-1203 has an enhancement of $\alpha$ elements relative to iron of [$\alpha$/Fe]=$0.21\pm0.04$. With an age of $\sim$12.5 Gyr, TOI-1203 belongs to the old, $\alpha$-element enhanced stellar population of the galactic thick disk. We spectroscopically confirmed the planetary nature of the 25.5 d sub-Neptune TOI-1203 d, measured its mass ($M_{d}=7.39\pm0.62~M_{\oplus}$) and refined its radius ($R_{d}=2.918_{-0.045}^{+0.046}~R_{\oplus}$). We discovered the presence of an additional transiting super-Earth on a 4.2 d orbit (TOI-1203 b) with a mass of $M_{b}=3.51_{-0.32}^{+0.33}~M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_{b}=1.520_{-0.046}^{+0.045}~R_{\oplus}$. We also revealed the presence of two additional low-mass planets at 13.1 d and 204.6 d (TOI-1203 c and e), with minimum masses of $5.46_{-0.50}^{+0.51}~M_{\oplus}$ and $42.10_{-1.78}^{+1.83}~M_{\oplus}$. We found that the outer planet TOI-1203 e lies on an eccentric orbit with $e_{e}=0.152\pm0.029$. We performed a stability analysis of the system confirming that there are configurations consistent with the observed parameters that are dynamically stable over billion-year timescales. While analyzing the HARPS time series, we discovered that the FWHM of the HARPS cross-correlation function shows a significant long-period signal ($\sim$615 d) that has no counterpart in the radial velocity data or in the remaining HARPS ancillary time series. We significantly detected the same signal in the FWHM of the Th-Ar calibration lines used to compute the nightly wavelength solution, and attributed this systematic effect to a long-term variation of the HARPS instrumental profile.</description>

      <title>Calculating Occultation Light Curves using Wavelets: Exponential Atmospheres and the Constraints of Static Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signatures of waves are seen during many high-quality ground-based refractive stellar occultations by solar system atmospheres. We present a new forward-modeling technique for ground-based stellar occultations based on wavelet decomposition. If profiles of refractivity are written as the product of an exponential and a wavelet decomposition, then we can analytically write the profiles of the bending angles and the bending angle derivatives that are needed to calculate occultation light curves. Requiring that the atmosphere is statically stable places limits on the amplitudes of atmospheric waves and their effect on the observed light curve.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric Electron Heat Flow Modulates Planetary Ambipolar Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambipolar electrostatic field has long been recognized as a key driver of ion escape from planetary atmospheres. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the generation of this field is critical for understanding atmospheric escape and the evolution of habitability on terrestrial planets. Yet, existing comparisons between ambipolar diffusion theory and in-situ potential measurements have largely neglected the effect of electron heat flow. Confronting the theory incorporating heat-flow effect with in-situ electrical potential data from the \textit{Endurance} sounding rocket mission, we identify observational signatures of electron heat-flow effects. Furthermore, the implications of electron heat-flow effect across terrestrial planets are revealed, focusing on its capacity to resolve the enigma of Venusian electric potential drop anomaly. The anisotropic ion temperatures and the associated enhancement of electron heat-flow effect can explain the anomalous electric potential drop observed in the ionosphere of Venus.</description>

      <title>Astroclimes -- measuring the abundance of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the Earth's atmosphere using astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.</description>

      <title>Stellar halo subtraction alternative for accreting companions' characterization with integral field spectroscopy: Analytical and on-sky demonstration on the PDS70, HTLup, and YSES1 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&amp;K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.</description>

      <title>What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.</description>

      <title>The Moon as a possible source for Earth's co-orbital bodies</title>

Abstract: There is a growing number of Earth's co-orbital bodies being discovered. At least five of them are known to be temporarily in quasi-satellite orbits. One of those, 469219 Kamo'oalewa, was identified as possibly having the same composition as the Moon. We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to the formation of quasi-satellite orbits. We systematically investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the entire lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification methodology for identifying all co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the entire lunar surface with velocities ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be a common outcome, with approximately 6.15% of all simulated particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% specifically exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2 times escape velocity) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency at this specific velocity. The spatial distribution of successful ejections shows a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or the Moon occur for only 4% of the sample. Our results strengthen the plausibility of lunar origin for Earth's co-orbital bodies, including quasi-satellites like Kamo'oalewa and 2024 PT5. We identify both "prompt" and "delayed" co-orbital formation mechanisms, with a steady-state production regime that could explain the presence of lunar-derived objects in Earth's co-orbital regions despite the infrequent occurrence of major lunar impacts capable of launching meter-scale fragments.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of eccentricity in planet-disc interactions</title>

Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. III. Survey Performance After Three Years on Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) has been delivering a rich set of precise radial velocity (RV) measurements for 41 bright, nearby main sequence stars. Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using RVSearch demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: The Occurrence of Giant Planets orbiting M-dwarfs within 100 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P &lt; 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100\,pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds.
  We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\% \pm 0.047\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\% \pm 0.032\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample. We note that while our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 10.0$ days, these occurrence rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 5.0$ days. This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.</description>
