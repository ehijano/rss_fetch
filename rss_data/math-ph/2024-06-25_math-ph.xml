      <title>From Kalman to Einstein and Maxwell: the Structural Controllability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Special Relativity paper of Einstein (1905), only a footnote provides a reference to the conformal group of space-time for the Minkowski metric $\omega$. We prove that General Relativity (1915) will depend on the following {\it cornerstone} result of differential homological algebra (1990). Let $K$ be a differential field and $D=K[d_1,...,d_n]$ be the ring of differential operators with coefficients in $K$. If $M$ is the differential module over $D$ defined by the Killing operator ${\cal{D}} :T \rightarrow S_2T^*: \xi \rightarrow \Omega = {\cal{L}}(\xi) \omega$ and $N$ is the differential module over $D$ defined by the $Cauchy = ad(Killing)$ adjoint operator with torsion submodule $t(N)$, then $t(N) \simeq {ext}^1_D(M) = 0$ and the Cauchy operator can be thus parametrized by stress functions having strictly nothing to do with $\Omega$. This result is largely superseding the Kalman controllability test in classical OD control theory and is showing that controllability is a structural "{\it built-in}" property of an OD/PD control system not depending on the choice of inputs and outputs, contrary to the engineering tradition. It also points out the {\it terrible confusion} done by Einstein (1915) while following Beltrami (1892), both of them using the Einstein operator but ignoring that it was self-adjoint in the framework of differential double duality (1995). We finally prove that the structure of electromagnetism and gravitation only depends on the nonlinear {\it elations} of the conformal group of space-time, showing thus that {\it nothing is left from the mathematical foundations of both general relativity and gauge theory}.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds in the continuum via localized frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of interacting fermions in the continuum. Our approach uses the concept of lattice-localized frames, which we introduce here. We first prove a Lieb-Robinson bound that is valid for a general class of local interactions, which implies the existence of the dynamics at the level of the CAR algebra. We then turn to the physical situation relevant to the (fractional) quantum Hall effect, namely the quasi-free second quantized Landau Hamiltonian to which electron-electron interactions can be added.</description>

      <title>Construction and Accuracy of Electronic Continuum Models of Incommensurate Bilayer 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle continuum models such as the popular Bistritzer-MacDonald model have become powerful tools for predicting electronic phenomena of incommensurate 2D materials and the development of many-body models aimed to model unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulators. In this work, we introduce a procedure to construct continuum models of arbitrary accuracy relative to tight-binding models for moir\'{e} incommensurate bilayers. This is done by recognizing the continuum model as arising from Taylor expansions of a high accuracy momentum space approximation of the tight-binding model. We apply our procedure in full detail to two models of twisted bilayer graphene and demonstrate both admit the Bistritzer-MacDonald model as the leading order continuum model, while higher order expansions reveal qualitative spectral differences.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Some Logistic Maps and the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the relation between the $r=1$ logistic map $x_{i+1}=rx_i(1-x_i)$, $x_i\in\mathbb R$, $i=0,1,\ldots$, $r&gt;0$ and $x_0\geq0$, and the RG flow in the multiscale analysis of zero fixed point, asymptotic free QFT models as e.g. the ultraviolet (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model and QCD, and the infrared $\phi^4_4$. We obtain the asymptotics of the mapping, showing an inverse power decay to the fixed point $x^*=0$ Gaussian fixed point, with logarithmic-like corrections. This asymptotics is independent of the initial condition $x_0\in(0,1)$ (so, there is no constraint for $x_0$ to be small, as usual in QFT models), and only depends on the lowest orders in a polynomial perturbation. In asymptotic free QFT, this means that knowing the RG $\beta$ function expansion up to higher orders in the coupling does not improve our knowledge of the flow asymptotics. A comparison with an ODE with continuous time is made by analyzing stability of the solution with higher order monomial perturbations. We also obtain the asymptotics for $0&lt;r&lt;1$. Also, our methods work when $r\in(1,3]$. It is known, but without detailed asymptotics, that all trajectories with initial condition $x_0\in(-1,1)$ converge to the fixed point $x^*=(r-1)/r$. For the super attractive case $r=2$, we obtain an explicit exact solution with an exploding nonconstant exponential decay rate to the $x^*=1/2$ fixed point. Our methods include the use of iterations, a discrete version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a discrete version of the integrating factor method for 1st order linear ODEs and, sometimes, a scaling transformation. We do not use the Banach contraction mapping theorem, which only provides an upper bound on the asymptotics. We expect that our methods apply to determine the asymptotics of the logistic map for a wider range of parameters, where other fixed points are present.</description>

      <title>Overdamped QNM for Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the number of quasinormal modes (QNM) for Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in a disc of radius $ r $ is bounded from below by $ c r^3 $. This shows that the recent upper bound by J\'ez\'equel is sharp. The argument is an application of a spectral asymptotics result for non-self-adjoint operators which provides a finer description of QNM and explains the emergence of a distorted lattice on which they lie. Our presentation gives a general result about exponentially accurate Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules for one dimensional problems. The description of QNM allows their accurate evaluation ``deep in the complex" where numerical methods break down due to pseudospectral effects.</description>

      <title>Functional measures associated to operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every operator in $L^{2}$ has an associated measure on a space of functions and prove that it can be used to find solutions to abstract Cauchy problems, including partial differential equations. We find explicit formulas to compute the integral of functions with respect to this measure and develop approximate formulas in terms of a perturbative expansion. We show that this method can be used to represent solutions of classical equations, such as the diffusion and Fokker-Plank equations, as Wiener and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jansen-de Dominics integrals, and propose an extension to paths in infinite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>A study on the domain independence of the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness in lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness for lattice equations (partial difference equations), mainly focusing on how the choice of initial value problem (the choice of domain) affects these properties. We show that these properties do not depend on the choice of domain as long as they are considered together. In other words, these properties are inherent to a difference equation. Applying our result, we discuss the reductions of lattice equations. We show that any reduction of a Laurent system, even if the lattices have torsion elements, preserves the Laurent property.</description>

      <title>On open book analogs of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum graphs have become in this century a favorite playground for mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and chemists, due to their manifold applications as models of thin structures, as well as presenting sometimes simpler playground for hard higher dimensional problems.
  It was clear from some applications that thin surface structures (looking as stratified varieties) also arise, for instance in photonic crystals theory and dynamical systems. However, both justification and studying of these models is much harder and very little progress has been made by now. The goal of this note is to set down some basic notions and results for such structures.
  The name ``open book'' has been used for such geometric structures in topology and comes from an image of several smooth $n$-dimensional ``pages'' bound to an $(n-1)$- dimensional ``binding.''</description>

      <title>Tumbling Downhill along a Given Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cylinder will roll down an inclined plane in a straight line. A cone will roll around a circle on that plane and then will stop rolling. We ask the inverse question: For which curves drawn on the inclined plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ can one carve a shape that will roll downhill following precisely this prescribed curve and its translationally repeated copies? This simple question has a solution essentially always, but it turns out that for most curves, the shape will return to its initial orientation only after crossing a few copies of the curve - most often two copies will suffice, but some curves require an arbitrarily large number of copies.</description>

      <title>Eigenvectors in terms of reduced complements of minor determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvectors associated with non-degenerate eigenvalues are shown to correspond to columns of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix. Degenerate eigenvalues are associated with eigenvectors that correspond to reduced complement tensors of minor determinants of the characteristic matrix. These observations are corroborated by a description of the non-degenerate two-level system and the Dirac equation, which exhibits twofold spin degeneracy of energy eigenvalues. Trace identities for the reduced order-one complement tensor and the diagonal sum of minor determinants are also presented.</description>

      <title>On a Generating Function for the Isotropic Basis Functions and Other Connected Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- i.e. that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the local Hadamard well-posedness of a certain third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a multi-term linear part and a general power nonlinearity known as the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, formulated on a finite interval with a combination of nonzero Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Specifically, for initial and boundary data in suitable Sobolev spaces that are related to one another through the time regularity induced by the equation, we prove the existence of a unique solution as well as the continuous dependence of that solution on the data. The precise choice of solution space depends on the value of the Sobolev exponent and is dictated both by the linear estimates associated with the forced linear counterpart of the nonlinear initial-boundary value problem and, in the low-regularity setting below the Sobolev algebra property threshold, by certain nonlinear estimates that control the Sobolev norm of the power nonlinearity. In particular, as usual in Schr\"odinger-type equations, in the case of low regularity it is necessary to derive Strichartz estimates in suitable Lebesgue/Bessel potential spaces. The proof of well-posedness is based on a contraction mapping argument combined with the linear estimates, which are established by employing the explicit solution formula for the forced linear problem derived via the unified transform of Fokas. Due to the nature of the finite interval problem, this formula involves contour integrals in the complex Fourier plane with corresponding integrands that contain differences of exponentials in their denominators, thus requiring delicate handling through appropriate contour deformations. It is worth noting that, in addition to the various linear and nonlinear results obtained for the finite interval problem, novel time regularity results are established here also for the relevant half-line problem.</description>

      <title>On the null space of the backprojection operator and Rubin's conjecture for the spherical mean transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical mean transform associates to a function $f$ its integral averages over all spheres. We consider the spherical mean transform for functions supported in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for odd $n$, with the centers of integration spheres restricted to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. In this setup, Rubin employed properties of Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional integrals and analytic continuation to re-derive the explicit inversion formulas proved earlier by Finch, Patch, and Rakesh using wave equation techniques. As part of his work, Rubin stated a conjecture relating spherical mean transform, its associated backprojection operator and the Riesz potential. Furthermore, he pointed to the necessity of a detailed analysis of injectivity of the backprojection operator as a crucial step toward the resolution of his conjecture. This article addresses both questions posed by Rubin by providing a characterization of the null space of the backprojection operator, and disproving the conjecture through the construction of an explicit counterexample. Crucial to the proofs is the range characterization for the spherical mean transform in odd dimensions derived recently by the authors.</description>

Abstract: We explore two variations of the Curtright-Zachos (CZ) deformation of the Virasoro algebra. Firstly, we introduce a scaled CZ algebra that inherits the scaling structure found in the differential operator representation of the magnetic translation (MT) operators. We then linearly decompose the scaled CZ generators to derive two types of Hom-Lie deformations of the W-infinity algebra. We discuss *-bracket formulations of these algebras and their connection to the Moyal product. We show that the *-bracket form of the scaled CZ algebra arises from the Moyal product, while we obtain the second type of deformed W-infinity through a coordinate transformation of the first type of Moyal operators. From a physical point of view, we construct the Hamiltonian of a tight binding model (TBM) using the Wyle matrix representation of the scaled CZ algebra. We note that the integer powers of q are linked to the quantum fluctuations that are inherent in the Moyal product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetric Non-Hermitian Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and explore PT-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics consisting of a ferromagnetic YIG sphere driven by external magnetic field. Non-Hermicity is engineered by using a traveling field directly interacting with YIG. The external magnetic field excites collective mechanical modes of magnons, which later excites cavity mode leading to a coupling between cavity magnons and photons. The magnomechanical interaction of the system also excites phonon and couple them to the system. By computing eigenvalue spectrum, we demonstrate the occurrence of three-order exceptional point emerge with the increase of magnon-photon coupling at a specific incidence angle of traveling field. We illustrate the unique bi-broken and uni-protected PT-symmetry regions in eigenvalue spectrum unlike previously investigated non-Hermitian system, which can be tuned with gain and loss configuration by manipulating ratio between traveling field strength and magnon-photon coupling. Interestingly, protected PT-symmetry only exists on the axis of exceptional point. We further show that the PT-symmetry can only be govern at two angle of incident of traveling field. However, later, by performing stability analysis, we illustrate that the system is only stable at $\pi/2$ and, on all other angles, either the system is non-PT-symmetric or it is unstable. Furthermore, we govern the parametric stability conditions for the system and, by defining stablity parameter, illustrate the stable and unstable parametric regimes. Our finding not only discusses a new type of PT-symmetric system, but also could act as foundation to bring cavity magnomechanics to the subject of quantum information and process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective action formalism introduced by Vilkovisky and later modified by DeWitt is completely covariant suitable for obtaining an effective action that is independent of the parametrization of the quantum fields. Among a few basic properties of an effective action, one property is that it can be written as a sum of one-particle irreducible diagrams. In this work, we verify this property up to three-loop order for Vilkovisky-Dewitt effective action (VDEA) by solving the equations satisfied by VDEA written down in the original parametrization for non-gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Noise in V-Shape Linear Well Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium noise is characterized as noise realizations where external agitations disrupt the harmonic equilibrium of Brownian motion. Excitations in a particle's random walk into a so-called L\'evy flight changes the distribution of the noise from Gaussian to the fat-tailed L\'evy distribution. Generalization between Gaussian and L\'evy distributions is the $\alpha$-stability distribution, where $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. In this study, the $\alpha$-stability distributed noise is subjugated into the Langevin and fractional Fokker--Planck equations that correspond to a V-shaped linear potential well $V(x)=F|x|$. From these equations, an Euler scheme for computational simulation via iterations is presented, and a probability density function that is normalizable under any $\alpha\in(1,2]$ is obtained. This study is focused more on the theoretical framework of non-equilibrium noise in V-shaped linear well profiles, which is intended to be applied to systems known to exhibit self-organized criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

Abstract: A universal Turing machine is a powerful concept - a single device can compute any function that is computable. A universal spin model, similarly, is a class of physical systems whose low energy behavior simulates that of any spin system. Our categorical framework for universality (arXiv:2307.06851) captures these and other examples of universality as instances. In this article, we present an accessible account thereof with a focus on its basic ingredients and ways to use it. Specifically, we show how to identify necessary conditions for universality, compare types of universality within each instance, and establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability).</description>

      <title>Commutative families in DIM algebra, integrable many-body systems and $q,t$ matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our consideration of commutative subalgebras (rays) in different representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra to the elliptic Hall algebra (or, equivalently, to the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra $U_{q,t}(\widehat{\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$). Its advantage is that it possesses the Miki automorphism, which makes all commutative rays equivalent. Integrable systems associated with these rays become finite-difference and, apart from the trigonometric Ruijsenaars system not too much familiar. We concentrate on the simplest many-body and Fock representations, and derive explicit formulas for all generators of the elliptic Hall algebra $e_{n,m}$. In the one-body representation, they differ just by normalization from $z^nq^{m\hat D}$ of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Lie algebra, and, in the $N$-body case, they are non-trivially generalized to monomials of the Cherednik operators with action restricted to symmetric polynomials. In the Fock representation, the resulting operators are expressed through auxiliary polynomials of $n$ variables, which define weights in the residues formulas. We also discuss $q,t$-deformation of matrix models associated with constructed commutative subalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry-enriched topological orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror-symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

Abstract: The reduction of the `master system' of free motion on the cotangent bundle $T^*G$ of a compact, connected and simply connected, semisimple Lie group is considered using the conjugation action of $G$. It is proved that the restriction of the reduced system to the smooth component of the quotient space $T^*G/G$, given by the principal orbit type, inherits the degenerate integrability of the master system. The proof can be generalized easily to other interesting examples of Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria of Mechanical Systems with Rotational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of classifying relative equilibria for mechanical systems with rotational symmetry. We divide relative equilibria into two natural groups: a generic class which we call normal, and a non-generic abnormal class. The eigenvalues of the locked inertia tensor descend to shape-space and endow it with the geometric structure of a 3-web with the property that any normal relative equilibrium occurs as a critical point of the potential restricted to a leaf from the web. To demonstrate the utility of this web structure we show how the spherical 3-body problem gives rise to a web of Cayley cubics on the 3-sphere, and use this to fully classify the relative equilibria for the case of equal masses.</description>

      <title>A crossed module representation of a $2$-group constructed from the $3$-loop group $\Omega^3 G$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of chiral fermions on a 3-manifold in an external gauge potential is known to lead to an abelian extension of the gauge group. In this article we concentrate on the case of $\Omega^3 G$ of based smooth maps on a 3-sphere taking values in a compact Lie group $G.$ There is a crossed module constructed from an abelian extension $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ of this group and a group of automorphims acting on it as explained in a recent article by Mickelson and Niemim\"aki. We shall construct a representation of this crossed module in terms of a repesentation of $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ on a space of functions of gauge potentials with values in a fermionic Fock space and a representation of the automorphism group of $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ as outer automorphisms of the canonical anticommutation relations algebra in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Principal Landau Determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate the Landau analysis of Feynman integrals with the aim of advancing the state of the art in modern particle-physics computations. We contribute new algorithms for computing Landau singularities, using tools from polyhedral geometry and symbolic/numerical elimination. Inspired by the work of Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky (GKZ) on generalized Euler integrals, we define the principal Landau determinant of a Feynman diagram. We illustrate with a number of examples that this algebraic formalism allows to compute many components of the Landau singular locus. We adapt the GKZ framework by carefully specializing Euler integrals to Feynman integrals. For instance, ultraviolet and infrared singularities are detected as irreducible components of an incidence variety, which project dominantly to the kinematic space. We compute principal Landau determinants for the infinite families of one-loop and banana diagrams with different mass configurations, and for a range of cutting-edge Standard Model processes. Our algorithms build on the Julia package Landau.jl and are implemented in the new open-source package PLD.jl available at https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/PLD/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish identities of Pfaffian type for the theta function associated with twice or half the period matrix of a hyperelliptic curve. They are implied by the large size asymptotic analysis of exact Pfaffian identities for expectation values of ratios of characteristic polynomials in ensembles of orthogonal or quaternionic self-dual random matrices. We show that they amount to identities for the theta function with the period matrix of a hyperelliptic curve, and in this form we reprove them by direct geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Equality of critical parameters for percolation of Gaussian free field level-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider upper level-sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d\geq 3$, above a given real-valued height parameter $h$. As $h$ varies, this defines a canonical percolation model with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. We prove that three natural critical parameters associated to this model, respectively describing a well-ordered subcritical phase, the emergence of an infinite cluster, and the onset of a local uniqueness regime in the supercritical phase, actually coincide. At the core of our proof lies a new interpolation scheme aimed at integrating out the long-range dependence of the Gaussian free field. Due to the strength of correlations, its successful implementation requires that we work in an effectively critical regime. Our analysis relies extensively on certain novel renormalization techniques that bring into play all relevant scales simultaneously. The approach in this article paves the way to a complete understanding of the off-critical phases for strongly correlated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable Simulation of Quantum Channels: the Error Exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem has been a milestone in quantum information theory. It states that asymptotically reliable simulation of a quantum channel, assisted by unlimited shared entanglement, requires a rate of classical communication equal to the channel's entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this paper, we study the error exponent of quantum channel simulation, which characterizes the optimal speed of exponential convergence of the performance towards the perfect, as the blocklength increases. Based on channel purified distance, we derive lower and upper bounds for the error exponent. Then we show that the two bounds coincide when the classical communication rate is below a critical value, and hence, we have determined the exact formula of the error exponent in the low-rate case. This enables us to obtain an operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order from 1 to 2, since our formula is expressed as a transform of this quantity. In the derivation, we have also obtained an achievability bound for quantum channel simulation in the finite-blocklength setting, which is of realistic significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1977 L\"uscher found a class of SO(4)-symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills solutions in Minkowski space, which have been rederived 40 years later by employing the isometry $S^3\cong\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and conformally mapping SU(2)-equivariant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on (two copies of) de Sitter space $\mathrm{dS}_4\cong\mathbb{R}{\times}S^3$. Here we present the noncompact analog of this construction via $\mathrm{AdS}_3\cong\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. On (two copies of) anti-de Sitter space $\mathrm{AdS}_4\cong\mathbb{R}{\times}\mathrm{AdS}_3$ we write down SU(1,1)-equivariant Yang-Mills solutions and conformally map them to $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. This yields a two-parameter family of exact SU(1,1) Yang-Mills solutions on Minkowski space, whose field strengths are essentially rational functions of Cartesian coordinates. Gluing the two AdS copies happens on a $\mathrm{dS}_3$ hyperboloid in Minkowski space, and our Yang-Mills configurations are singular on a two-dimensional hyperboloid $\mathrm{dS}_3\cap\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$. This renders their action and the energy infinite, although the field strengths fall off fast asymptotically except along the lightcone. We also construct Abelian solutions, which share these properties but are less symmetric and of zero action.</description>

Abstract: For a punctured surface $\mathfrak{S}$, the author and Scarinci (arXiv:2112.13329) have recently constructed a quantization of a moduli space of Lorentzian metrics on the 3-manifold $\mathfrak{S} \times \mathbb{R}$ of constant sectional curvature $\Lambda \in \{-1,0,1\}$. The invariance of this quantization under the action of the mapping class group ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ of $\mathfrak{S}$ yields families of unitary representations of ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ on a Hilbert space, with key ingredients being three versions of the quantum dilogarithm functions depending on $\Lambda$. In this survey article, we review and elaborate on this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of Hopf algebra and noncommutative differential geometry to build a noncommutative (NC) theory of gravity in a bottom-up approach. Noncommutativity is introduced via deformed Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms by means of a Drinfeld twist. The final result of the construction is a general formalism for obtaining NC corrections to the classical theory of gravity for a wide class of deformations and a general background. This also includes a novel proposal for noncommutative Einstein manifold. Moreover, the general construction is applied to the case of a linearized gravitational perturbation theory to describe a NC deformation of the metric perturbations. We specifically present an example for the Schwarzschild background and axial perturbations, which gives rise to a generalization of the work by Regge and Wheeler. All calculations are performed up to first order in perturbation of the metric and noncommutativity parameter. The main result is the noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential. Finally, we comment on some differences in properties between the Regge-Wheeler potential and its noncommutative counterpart.</description>

      <title>New classical integrable systems from generalized $T\bar{T}$-deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel class of classical integrable many-body systems obtained by generalized $T\bar{T}$-deformations of free particles. Deformation terms are bilinears in densities and currents for the continuum of charges counting asymptotic particles of different momenta. In these models, which we dub ``semiclassical Bethe systems'' for their link with the dynamics of Bethe ansatz wave packets, many-body scattering processes are factorised, and two-body scattering shifts can be set to an almost arbitrary function of momenta. The dynamics is local but inherently different from that of known classical integrable systems. At short scales, the geometry of the deformation is dynamically resolved: either particles are slowed down (more space available), or accelerated via a novel classical particle-pair creation/annihilation process (less space available). The thermodynamics both at finite and infinite volumes is described by the equations of (or akin to) the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and at large scales generalized hydrodynamics emerge.</description>

Abstract: 40 years ago, Conway and Sloane proposed using the highly symmetrical Coxeter-Todd lattice $K_{12}$ for quantization, and estimated its second moment. Since then, all published lists identify $K_{12}$ as the best 12-dimensional lattice quantizer. Surprisingly, $K_{12}$ is not optimal: we construct two new 12-dimensional lattices with lower normalized second moments. The new lattices are obtained by gluing together 6-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotics of polynomials satisfying the orthogonality relations $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} z^k P_n(z; t , N) \mathrm{e}^{-N \left(\frac{1}{4}z^4 + \frac{t}{2}z^2 \right)} \mathrm{d} z = 0 \quad \text{ for } \quad k = 0, 1, ..., n-1, $$ where the complex parameter $t$ is in the so-called two-cut region. As an application, we deduce asymptotic formulas for certain families of solutions of Painlev\'e-IV which are indexed by a non-negative integer and can be written in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The proofs are based on the characterization of orthogonal polynomials in terms of a Riemann-Hilbert problem and the Deift-Zhou non-linear steepest descent method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with dynamic boundary conditions. In contrast to classical Neumann boundary conditions, the dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn--Hilliard type allow for dynamic changes of the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the boundary, a convection-induced motion of the contact line as well as absorption of material by the boundary. The coupling conditions for bulk and surface quantities involve parameters $K,L\in[0,\infty]$, whose choice declares whether these conditions are of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type. We first prove the existence of a weak solution to our model in the case $K,L\in (0,\infty)$ by means of a Faedo--Galerkin approach. For all other cases, the existence of a weak solution is then shown by means of the asymptotic limits, where $K$ and $L$ are sent to zero or to infinity, respectively. Eventually, we establish higher regularity for the phase-fields, and we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions given that the mobility functions are constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

      <title>Particle Scattering and Fusion for the Ablowitz-Ladik Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future, particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion rule.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4D (i.e., 3+1D) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We uncover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with any violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Local Hamiltonian dynamics from non-local action principles and applications to binary systems in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantisation of tensor multiplet models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is applied to quantise the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric generalisation of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model, which was proposed by Lindstr\"om and Ro\v{c}ek in 1983 in Minkowski superspace and is lifted to a supergravity background in this paper. This super FT theory describes a non-Abelian tensor multiplet and is known to be classically equivalent to a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model. Using path integral considerations, we demonstrate that this equivalence holds at the quantum level in the sense that the quantum supercurrents in the two theories coincide. A modified Faddeev-Popov procedure is employed to quantise models for the ${\cal N}=2$ tensor multiplet in harmonic superspace. The obtained results agree with those derived by applying the Batalin-Vilkovisky scheme within the harmonic superspace setting.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>
