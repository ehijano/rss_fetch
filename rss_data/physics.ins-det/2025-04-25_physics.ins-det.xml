      <title>Performance of the MORA Apparatus for Testing Time-Reversal Invariance in Nuclear Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MORA experimental setup is designed to measure the triple-correlation D parameter in nuclear beta decay. The D coefficient is sensitive to possible violations of time-reversal invariance. The experimental configuration consists of a transparent Paul trap surrounded by a detection setup with alternating beta and recoil-ion detectors. The octagonal symmetry of the detection setup optimizes the sensitivity of positron-recoil-ion coincidence rates to the D correlation, while reducing systematic effects. MORA utilizes an innovative in-trap laser polarization technique. The design and performance of the ion trap, associated beamline elements, lasers and beta and recoil-ion detectors, are presented. Recent progress towards the polarization proof-of-principle is described.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Hamamatsu R11065-20 PMTs for use in the SABRE South NaI(Tl) Crystal Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SABRE Experiment is a direct detection dark matter experiment using a target composed of multiple NaI(Tl) crystals. The experiment aims to be an independent check of the DAMA/LIBRA results with a detector in the Northern (Laboratori Nazionali Del Gran Sasso, LNGS) and Southern (Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, SUPL) hemispheres. The SABRE South photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) will be used near the low energy noise threshold and require a detailed calibration of their performance and contributions to the background in the NaI(Tl) dark matter search, prior to installation. We present the development of the pre-calibration procedures for the R11065-20 Hamamatsu PMTs. These PMTs are directly coupled to the NaI(Tl) crystals within the SABRE South experiment. In this paper we present methodologies to characterise the gain, dark rate, and timing properties of the PMTs. We develop a method for in-situ calibration without a light injection source. Additionally we explore the application of machine learning techniques using a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) trained on the response of single PMTs to understand the information available for background rejection. Finally, we briefly present the simulation tool used to generate digitised PMT data from optical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Design and Monte Carlo Simulation of a Neutron Beam Shutter for Cyclotron-Based Neutron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel design methodology for neutron beam shutters that integrates Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP) with machine learning techniques to enhance shielding performance and accelerate the design process. The target facility is a compact neutron science platform where neutrons are produced by proton beams from a cyclotron striking a neutron production target. The system includes both thermal and fast neutron beamlines. A beam shutter is installed on the thermal neutron line to reduce occupational radiation exposure during maintenance activities.
  In this work, 200 neutron shutter configurations with varying material sequences were simulated using MCNP. The resulting dataset was used to train a fully connected neural network to predict the neutron flux downstream of the shielding. The trained model was subsequently applied to 1,000 randomly generated shielding configurations for rapid flux prediction and performance ranking. The 20 designs with the lowest predicted flux were selected and further validated via MCNP simulations.
  Results show that the optimal design reduces the neutron flux from 5.61 x 10^9 n/cm2*s at the shutter entrance to 4.96 x 10^5 n/cm2*s at the exit, achieving a reduction of four orders of magnitude. These findings confirm that the integration of machine learning techniques can effectively reduce simulation costs and assist in identifying high-performance shielding configurations, demonstrating the strong potential of data driven approaches in neutron system design.</description>

      <title>Modular Cosmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and its Potential Use in Various Physics Experiments, Astrophysics and Geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the collaboration building a set of detectors for the new collider, our group was tasked with designing and building a large-scale cosmic ray detector, which was to complement the capabilities of the MPD (Dubna) detec-tor set. The detector was planned as a trigger for cosmic ray particles and to be used to calibrate and test other systems. Additional functions were to be the detection of pairs of high-energy muons originating from some parti-cle decay processes generated during collisions and con-tinuous observation of the cosmic muon stream in order to detect multi muons events. From the very beginning, the detector was designed as a scalable and universal device for many applications. The following work will present the basic features and parameters of the Modular COsmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and examples of its possible use in high energy physics, astrophysics and geology. Thanks to its universal nature, MCORD can be potential used as a fast trigger, neutron veto detector, muon detector and as a tool in muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Operational experience and performance of the Silicon Vertex Detector after the first long shutdown of Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, the Belle II experiment resumed data taking after the Long Shutdown 1, which was required to install a two-layer pixel detector and upgrade accelerator components. We describe the challenges of this shutdown and the operational experience thereafter. With new data, the silicon-strip vertex detector (SVD) confirmed the high hit efficiency, the large signal-to-noise ratio, and the excellent cluster position resolution. In the coming years, the SuperKEKB peak luminosity is expected to increase to its target value, resulting in a larger SVD occupancy caused by beam background. Considerable efforts have been made to improve SVD reconstruction software by exploiting the excellent SVD hit-time resolution to determine the collision time and reject off-time particle hits. A novel procedure to group SVD hits event-by-event, based on their time, has been developed using the grouping information during reconstruction, significantly reducing the fake rate while preserving the tracking efficiency. The front-end chip (APV25) is operated in the multi-peak mode, which reads six samples. A 3/6-mixed acquisition mode, based on the timing precision of the trigger, reduces background occupancy, trigger dead-time, and data size. Studies of the radiation damage show that the SVD performance will not seriously degrade during the lifetime of the detector, despite moderate radiation-induced increases in sensor current and strip noise.</description>

      <title>A new dark matter direct search based on archaeological Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Muon Imaging of Hydrotreatment Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the design and simulation-based validation of a muon imaging system tailored for potential applications in industrial hydrotreatment units. The system is built around a two-panel plastic scintillator hodoscope, equipped with silicon photomultipliers and read-out via a CAEN FERS-A5202 acquisition system. The detector was calibrated using a stepwise ``staircase'' method and characterized under open-sky and controlled conditions. We conducted muon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead shielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA framework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With the detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a realistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal variations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and computing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to detect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of exposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural information. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$ from vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain feasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the feasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex industrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for real-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural analysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>
