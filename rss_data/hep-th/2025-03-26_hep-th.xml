      <title>A holographic description on half planes and wedges for N = 1 SUSY BF theory in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BF theory is a topological field theory that appears in different parts of theoretical physics and one of its important uses is in lower dimensional holography settings. While it can be defined as a dimensional reduction of 3D CS theory, it is also equivalent to JT gravity. Moreover, further holographic settings relate BF theory to a particle on group theory. Here, we reconsider this "simplest holography" construction as SL(2,R) invariant particle on group theory and extend the web of dualities diagram in terms of a holographic description of the 2D N=1 BF theory on half-plane and find its 1D particle on group description as N=1B supermultiplet superconformal quantum mechanics. Moreover, we provide wedge space holography-type construction to achieve codimension 2 holography and show the web of dualities diagram also closes diagonally for BF and CS theories. For BF theory it leads to a complex 1D particle on group mechanics on the face of the wedge, a 0D quantum mechanics on the boundary theory of the faces, and its supersymmetric extension is a supermultiplet containing complex boson and complex scalar of the Landau-Ginzburg type. Upon this construction boundary theory also realizes a global U_j(1) invariance which extends the total symmetry group. To have a more complete picture we also included wedge space holography for 3D CS theory as an appendix and showed its codimension 2 holography corresponds to a 1D particle on group we found earlier.</description>

      <title>Symmetries Beyond Branes: Geometric Engineering and Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the relation between finite isometries of the internal space and symmetries of the transverse field theory in Geometric Engineering. On top of the established relation between branes wrapping torsional cycles and topological defects, we study other symmetries of the field theory that are not captured by branes wrapped at infinity. Isometries of the engineering geometry have a representations on the field theory, encoded by their non-trivial actions on exceptional and torsional cycles. In this work we describe such action in general terms. As examples, we focus on three classes of geometric engineering spaces: Du Val singularities, toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and $G_2$ manifolds obtained as fibrations of Du Val singularities over $\mathbb S^3$. In the latter case, we check explicitly that M-theory on Calabi-Yau or $G_2$ manifold with finite isometries reproduces correctly the higher group structures and non-invertible symmetries of the transverse field theories.</description>

      <title>Relational Supersymmetry and Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relationality is the paradigmatic conceptual core of general-relativistic gauge field theory. It can be made manifest via the Dressing Field Method (DFM) of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to achieve gauge-invariance by extracting the physical degrees of freedom representing relations among field variables. We review and further expand on some applications of the DFM to the very foundations of the supersymmetric framework, where it allows to build relational supersymmetric field theory and (dis)solves crucial issues. Furthermore, we elaborate on a novel approach within the relational supersymmetric field theory framework giving a unified description of fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields, and thus close to Berezin's original motivation for the introduction of supergeometry in fundamental physics: a Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Unification (MISU). This new approach stands irrespective from the ultimate empirical status of standard supersymmetric field theory, about which it is agnostic.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit derivation of the four-dilatino scattering amplitude from type II superstring theory is presented. This is obtained by using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations for closed string scattering amplitudes in terms of the product of two open string scattering amplitudes. We also investigate its Regge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operator-algebraic definition for timelike entanglement entropy in QFT. This rigorously defined timelike entanglement entropy is real-valued due to the timelike tube theorem. A simple proof of the $F$-theorem is provided by the strong subadditivity inequality of this timelike entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Resurgent properties of $T\overline{T}$-deformed conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the resurgence analysis on the $T\overline{T}$-deformed 2d conformal field theory (CFT). Writing the deformed partition function as an infinite series in the deformation parameter $\lambda$, we develop efficient analytical methods to compute high-order terms of the $\lambda$-series. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the large-order perturbative series, we show that the $\lambda$-series is asymptotic and extract non-perturabtive contributions by resurgence. This paper extends a previous Letter of the same authors to interacting rational CFTs, with Lee-Yang CFT as a concrete example. We also discuss possible implications of the resurgence results on holography.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data.</description>

      <title>ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of mutual information in the Page curve for a functional renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work delves into probing the importance of mutual information of relevant subsystems in obtaining the correct time-evolution of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation, as suggested by Page. This was done by considering a functional renormalization group improved or simply, quantum corrected Schwarzschild black solution which captures the flavour of an effective theory of quantum gravity. The mentioned black hole solution emerges from a asymptotically safe average effective action which describes a trajectory in momentum-space and satisfies a renormalizarion group equation. Furthermore, in the before Page time scenario, the behaviour of the mutual information between appropriate subsystems over time leads to the Hartman-Maldacena time. The observations made for the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole have been compared to the same made for the standard Schwarzschild black hole in order to draw some novel conclusions. Based upon our observations, we also propose a formula for computing fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation for an eternal black hole, in presence of the island.</description>

      <title>Energy-Momentum Tensor and D-term of Baryons in Top-down Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a baryon in a top-down holographic QCD. In holographic QCD, the baryons are represented as solitons in a 5-dimensional gauge theory. We obtain the soliton solution by solving the equations of motion numerically. Using this result, the energy-momentum tensor and related quantities such as the mass, mean square radii, and the D-term (druck term) are computed. The evaluated D-term is about $-2.05$, whose absolute value is significantly larger than that in the previous work arXiv:2206.06578.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expanding, spatially flat ($k=0$) FLRW quantum spacetime with a Big Bang, considered as a background in Yang-Mills matrix models. The FLRW geometry emerges in the semi-classical limit as a projection from the fuzzy hyperboloid. We analyze the propagation of scalar fields, and demonstrate that their Feynman propagator resembles the Minkowski space Feynman propagator in the semi-classical regime. Moreover, the higher spin modes predicted by the matrix model are described explicitly. These results are compared to recent results on $k=-1$ FLRW quantum spacetimes with a Big Bounce.</description>

      <title>Perturbative aspects of the supersymmetric three-dimensional massive QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the study of perturbative aspects of a three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca theory minimally coupled to scalar superfields. Using the superfield formalism, we derive the propagators for both gauge and matter superfields and compute the leading quantum corrections to the effective action. The presence of the Proca-like term explicitly breaks gauge invariance, modifying the structure of the gauge superfield propagator and leading to an essentially new form of quantum contributions in comparison with the usual QED. We analyze the Feynman diagrams that contribute to the quadratic part of the effective action, obtaining corrections to both the kinetic and mass terms of the scalar superfields. Furthermore, we discuss the UV behavior of the model, considering its renormalization properties and the possibility of perturbative finiteness to all loop orders, similar to supersymmetric QED$_3$. Finally, we highlight potential applications of this model in condensed matter systems and possible connections with modified supersymmetric electrodynamics and dualities in lower-dimensional theories.</description>

      <title>Singular instantons with finite action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that in the absence of gravity there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons. In this paper, focusing on the false-vacuum decay in a single scalar field in flat Euclidean space, we provide a general discussion on $O(4)$-symmetric instantons that are singular at the true-vacuum bubble. We find that, for the action to remain finite without introducing a UV cutoff, the potential must be unbounded from below and take the exponential form, thereby evading Coleman's theorem. We then consider two explicit examples of such instantons and perturbatively analyze the dynamics of small deformations around them. We find that one of them does not allow regular deformations, which indicates that the $O(4)$ symmetric solution still gives the minimum action, while the other one is found to allow regular deformations that cost no additional action at second order in perturbation. The latter example opens up the possibility of the existence of non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with lower action if we allow singular instantons with finite action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed that global symmetries must be broken in Quantum Gravity. This includes higher-form symmetries, which are commonplace in supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. Recently, a quantitative criterion for the breaking of (higher-form) symmetries in effective field theories of gravity has been proposed. We studied this criterion in the context of center one-form symmetries broken by BPS states in Calabi--Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and M-theory. In a simple toy model, we evaluated the parameters quantifying the extent of symmetry breaking for large and small values of the moduli, comparing the scales of significant breaking with other relevant physical scales.</description>

      <title>Precision holography of AdS$_5$ bubbling geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic duality provides a microscopic interpretation of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter supergravity solutions. The dual states of the field theory give rise to expectation values of light operators. These expectation values correspond to coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of gauge-invariant combinations of supergravity fields. We consider the duality between type IIB theory on AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ and 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, focusing on the half-BPS sector. We clarify the structure of the precision holographic dictionary, making explicit the distinction between single-trace operators and single-particle operators, where the latter contain admixtures of multi-traces. We rewrite the holographic dictionary for half-BPS operators of dimension four in the single-particle basis. We then apply this dictionary to perform precision holographic studies of two different smooth supergravity solutions in the class derived by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena, that have been recently used to compute all-light four-point correlators by making extrapolations of heavy-light correlators.</description>

      <title>Generating Jackiw-Teitelboim Euclidean gravity from static three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider pure three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics in the static limit. We show that this theory can be mapped onto a two-dimensional gravitational model in the first-order formalism of Riemannian manifolds with Euclidean signature, coupled to a real scalar field naturally interpreted as a dilaton. In this framework, the Newtonian and cosmological constants in two dimensions are fully determined by the electric charge. The solution to this gravitational model is found to be trivial: a constant dilaton field on a flat manifold. However, we introduce two distinct shifts of the spin-connection that transform the model into Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Specifically, we identify two additional solutions: a hyperbolic manifold with also a constant dilaton configuration; and a spherical manifold where, again, the dilaton assumes a constant, nonzero field configuration. In both non-flat cases, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in the specific cases of compact manifolds, we establish that the manifold's radius is fixed by the cosmological constant (and, therefore, by the electric charge).</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ and the black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is ample evidence that the bulk dual of a $T\overline{T}$ deformed holographic CFT is a gravitational system with a finite area cutoff boundary. For states dual to black holes, the finite cutoff surface cannot be moved beyond the event horizon. We overcome this by considering an extension of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation with a boundary cosmological constant and a prescription for a sequence of flows that successfully pushes the cutoff boundary past the event horizon and arbitrarily close to the black hole singularity. We show how this sequence avoids the complexification of the deformed boundary energies. The approach to the singularity is reflected on the boundary by the approach of the deformed energies to an accumulation point in the limit of arbitrarily large distance in deformation space. We argue that this sequence of flows is automatically implemented by the gravitational path integral given only the values of the initial ADM charges and the area of the finite cutoff surface, suggesting a similar automatic boundary mechanism that keeps all the deformed energies real at arbitrary values of the deformation parameter. This leads to a natural definition of a deformed boundary canonical ensemble partition function that sums over the entire spectrum and remains real for any value of the deformation parameter. We find that this partition function displays Hagedorn growth at the scale set by the deformation parameter, which we associate to the region near the inner horizon in the bulk dual.</description>

      <title>Photonic Modes in Bonnor-Melvin Domain Walls: Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons in a \((2+1)\)-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime, which features a magnetic field aligned with the symmetry axis \(z\) and a nonzero cosmological constant \(\Lambda\). This cylindrically symmetric background preserves Lorentz invariance under boosts in the \(z\)-direction and corresponds to the \((2+1+0)\)-brane solution of the Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime in gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. By deriving the radial wave equation, which is mathematically identical to the Helmholtz equation, we obtain exact eigenvalue solutions applicable to both massive and massless vector bosons (photons). Notably, we find that photons acquire a nonzero ground-state energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their states form magnetized, rotating ring-like structures, which can be interpreted as rotating magnetic vortices.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in Cotton gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of General Relativity (GR) has recently been expanded through the introduction of Cotton Gravity (CG), a theoretical extension proposed by J. Harada. This modified approach integrates the Cotton tensor into the gravitational field equations, naturally encompassing all conventional GR solutions while allowing the cosmological constant to emerge as an integration constant. In this study, we delve into the implications of CG when coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), constructing and analyzing three distinct static, spherically symmetric configurations. Our investigation centers on the horizon structure, metric characteristics, and the underlying NLED Lagrangian density of each model. We also confront the theoretical predictions with observational data by comparing the calculated shadow radii of these solutions to constraints imposed by the Event Horizon Telescope's (EHT) measurements of Sgr A$^{*}$. The results reveal an extensive spectrum of spacetime geometries, ranging from multi-horizon structures to naked singularities. Furthermore, the agreement between the predicted shadow sizes and EHT observations reinforces the viability of these models in describing the astrophysical image of Sgr A$^{*}$ within certain parameter bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior and phase diagram of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime using an effective model. In our approach, the Polyakov loops along the compactified directions are treated as dynamic variables, and the model is calibrated to match lattice simulation results for thermodynamic observables on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$. Our analysis reveals a novel first-order phase transition in the deconfined phase that ends at critical points, which appear to belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. This transition is driven by the interplay between the two Polyakov loops, introduced via a cross-term in the Polyakov-loop potential.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. We compare this to the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Uncertainties in First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate theoretical uncertainties in perturbative analyses of first-order electroweak phase transitions (EWPT). Utilizing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, we quantify the gauge dependence, renormalization scheme, and scale dependences in predicting phase-transition parameters across both zero and finite chemical potential regimes. Our key findings reveal that: 1) the gauge-parameter dependence and the chemical potential are subdominants, and 2) Baryon number preservation criteria and phase transition observables exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the renormalization scale in the ${\overline{\rm MS}}$ scheme. Comparative analyses with the on-shell scheme demonstrate that within strongly first-order EWPT parameter spaces, the ${\overline{\rm MS}}$ scheme predicts enhanced phase transition strengths and prolonged transition durations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain on the line and in its ground state. In the regime of large mass, the non vanishing terms are only the on-site and the nearest-neighbour ones. Analytic expressions are obtained for their profiles, which are written in terms of piecewise linear functions that can be discontinuous and display sharp transitions as the separation between the blocks changes. In the regime of vanishing mass, where the matrices characterising the entanglement Hamiltonian contain couplings at all distances, we explore the location of the subdominant terms and some combinations of matrix elements that are useful for the continuum limit, comparing the results with the corresponding ones for the free chiral current. The single-particle entanglement spectra of these entanglement Hamiltonians are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density. This quantity can be influenced by ambient factors, following which, in this work we have investigated the impact of dark matter environment on the merger statistics. We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the conditions that must be imposed on the action for a magnetic universe in a theory of non-linear electrodynamics in order to have an asymptotically de Sitter initial state followed by a slow roll inflationary phase. We show that models so far proposed in the literature do not allow for a prolonged inflationary phase consistent with observations. We construct a Lagrangian that reduces to the Maxwell one in weak field; this is the only class of models that satisfies the required conditions for slow roll in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced entanglement at finite temperature: A memory-driven time-crystalline phase?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Dip and non-linearity in the curvature perturbation from inflation with a transient non-slow-roll stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Proca stars in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) Ellis wormholes. This study distinguishes itself from the analysis of the Proca stars in asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the AdS Ellis wormhole background, the mass of the wormhole solutions vanishes. Consequently, we employ numerical techniques to investigate in detail the impact of the cosmological constant on both the matter field and the wormhole geometry, while categorizing the solutions in accordance with the symmetries of the Proca field. The results show that when the cosmological constant decreases, not only does the characteristic spiral behavior of the Proca star solutions, namely the charge-frequency relation $Q$-$\omega$, gradually disappear, but the throat or both sides of the wormhole may also develop a ``horizon", presenting a ``black bounce" characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of $f(Q)$ cosmology with quintom-like scenario: the phantom field as effective realization of the non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that $f(Q)$ cosmology with a non-trivial connection, namely the Connection II of the literature, is dynamically equivalent with a quintom-like model. In particular, we show that the scalar field arising from the non-linear $f(Q)$ form, and the scalar field associated to the non-trivial connection, are combined to provide one canonical and one phantom field in the minisuperspace Lagrangian. Hence, the combination of two well-behaved fields appears effectively as a phantom field. This is fundamentally different from the usual approach in phantom and quintom cosmology, in which the phantom field is introduced ad hoc, and thus it may open a new way to handle the phantom fields, namely as effective realizations of the connection-related canonical fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all finite W-algebras in type $A$, a certain embedding of the finite W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of differential operators. We first prove a classical analogue for equivariant Slodowy slices using multiplication maps on generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian, then deduce the result for equivariant finite W-algebras by Fedosov quantization. This implies the statement for finite W-algebras, as well as Kostant-Whittaker reductions of arbitrary algebras in the category of Harish Chandra bimodules, including quantizations of Moore--Tachikawa varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the analytic continuation of $(p+q)$-dimensional Minkowski space (with $p$ and $q$ even) to $(p,q)$-signature, and study the conformal boundary of the resulting "Klein space". Unlike the familiar $(-+++..)$ signature, now the null infinity ${\mathcal I}$ has only one connected component. The spatial and timelike infinities ($i^0$ and $i'$) are quotients of generalizations of AdS spaces to non-standard signature. Together, ${\mathcal I}, i^0$ and $i'$ combine to produce the topological boundary $S^{p+q-1}$ as an $S^{p-1} \times S^{q-1}$ fibration over a null segment. The highest weight states (the $L$-primaries) and descendants of $SO(p,q)$ with integral weights give rise to natural scattering states. One can also define $H$-primaries which are highest weight with respect to a signature-mixing version of the Cartan-Weyl generators that leave a point on the celestial $S^{p-1} \times S^{q-1}$ fixed. These correspond to massless particles that emerge at that point and are Mellin transforms of plane wave states.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach for calculating one-loop effective action and vacuum energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach for calculating one-loop effective actions and vacuum energies in quantum field theory. Spectral functions are functions defined by the eigenvalues of an operator. One-loop effective actions and vacuum energies in quantum field theory, as well as scattering phase shifts and scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics, are all spectral functions. If a transformation between different spectral functions is identified, we can obtain a spectral function from another through the transformation. In this paper, we convert quantum mechanical methods for calculating scattering phase shifts and scattering amplitudes into quantum field theory methods for calculating one-loop effective actions and vacuum energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two families of AdS$_2$ vacua in Type IIB Supergravity performing U(1) and SL(2) T-dualities on the $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{$ \widehat{\mathbb{CP}}\!\!~^3$} \times $ I solutions to Type IIA recently reported in arXiv:2304.12207. Depending on the T-duality we operate, we find two different classes of solutions of the type $\text{AdS}_2 \times \text{$ \widehat{\mathbb{CP}}\!\!~^3$} \times $ I $\times$ I and $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{$ \widehat{\mathbb{CP}}\!\!~^3$} \times $ I $\times$ S$^1$. This provides evidence for more general classes of solutions $\text{AdS}_2 \times \text{$ \widehat{\mathbb{CP}}\!\!~^3$} \times \Sigma $, dual to superconformal quantum mechanics with ${\cal N}=5,6$ supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Physics with non-unital algebras? An invitation to the Okubo algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents some preliminary discussion on the possible relevance of the Okubonions, i.e. the real Okubo algebra $\mathcal{O}$, in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The Okubo algebra lacks a unit element and sits in the adjoint representation of its automorphism group $\text{SU}_{\mathcal{O}}$, thus being fundamentally different from the better-known octonions $\mathbb{O}$. While these latter may represent quarks (and color singlets), the Okubonions are conjectured to represent the gluons, i.e. the gauge bosons of the QCD $\text{SU}(3)$ color symmetry. However, it is shown that the $\text{SU}(3)$ groups pertaining to Okubonions and octonions are distinct and inequivalent subgroups of $Spin(8)$ that share no common $\text{SU}(2)$ subgroup. The unusual properties of Okubonions may be related to peculiar QCD phenomena like asymptotic freedom and color confinement, though the actual mechanisms remain to be investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity as well as gauge theories, non-trivial symmetries can appear at boundaries. In the presence of radiation some of the symmetries are not Hamiltonian vector fields, hence the definition of charges for the symmetries becomes delicate. It can lead to the problem of field-dependent 2-cocycles in the charge algebra, as opposed to the central extensions allowed in standard classical mechanics. We show that if the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, its covariance requirement guarantees that the algebra of Noether currents is free of field-dependent 2-cocycles, and its stationarity requirement further removes central extensions. Therefore the charge algebra admits at most a time-independent field-dependent 2-cocycle, whose existence depends on the boundary conditions. We report on new results for asymptotic symmetries at future null infinity that can be derived with this approach.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correction to the entropy of a Kerr-Newman family of black holes in $U(1)^2$-charged STU supergravity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading quantum-gravitational correction to the black hole entropy is known to be a universal logarithmic term. In this study, we investigate the logarithmic corrections for the black holes in the STU supergravity models, which are a bosonic truncation into a specific class of $U(1)^2$-charged Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We demonstrate how the entire Kerr-Newman-AdS and Kerr-Newman family of black holes can be recovered within the gauged and ungauged STU supergravity models as special embedding choices in 4D. Logarithmic corrections are computed using two distinct Euclidean quantum gravity setups for extremal and non-extremal limits of all embedded rotating, static, charged, and neutral black holes. Our calculations employ the on-shell heat kernel method based Seeley-DeWitt expansion computations. Notably, all the AdS$_4$ results exhibit a confirmed non-topological nature as compared to the flat counterparts, offering a natural and more comprehensive ``infrared window into the microstates'' of black holes.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz-covariant gauge. Concretely, in the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the Rindler coordinates, the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz-covariant gauge is obtained, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the B-field and ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and B-fields are decoupled from the ghost fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the B-field are examined in this study. Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the B-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of those mode-solutions are determined. Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1) gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the equal-time commutation relations of the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates are also given in this study.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies AdS/CFT in its $p$-adic version (at the ``finite place") in the setting where the bulk geometry is made up of the Tate curve, a discrete quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree. Generalizing a classic result due to Zabrodin, the boundary dual of the free massive bulk theory is explicitly derived. Introducing perturbative interactions, the Wittens diagrams for the two-point and three-point correlators are computed for generic scaling dimensions at one-loop and tree level respectively. The answers obtained demonstrate how $p$-adic AdS/CFT on the Tate curve provides a useful toy model for real CFTs at finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the phase space of a spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the covariant phase space formalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the $d$-dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine their commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The first of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is responsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been well-documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood, being integrable for $d \geq 2$ only if we allow for field-dependent diffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the construction of the duality group for $\mathcal N=2$ $\widehat{A}_n$-shaped quivers SCFTs and generalize it to the previously unexplored case of $\widehat{D}_n$-shaped quivers. We then provide a systematic description of non-invertible duality symmetries in both classes. Furthermore, we characterize the $\mathcal N=1$ mass deformations of these theories that preserve such symmetries, thereby identifying a large class of $\mathcal N=1$ SCFTs with non-invertible duality symmetries inherited from their parent $\mathcal N=2$ theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonplanar universal anomalous dimension of twist-two operators at four loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and push its direct diagrammatic calculation through Lorentz spin j=20, one unit beyond the state of the art, so as to confirm the correctness of the general, all-j result conjectured previously by us [1] imposing certain constraints on its analytic form. Thanks to our new result, such constraints can be eliminated altogether. By the same token, this allows us to re-derive, in a completely independent way, the nonplanar four-loop cusp anomalous dimension by taking the large-j limit of the general result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M-theory geometric engineering on non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds (CY4) produces 3d theories with 4 supercharges. Carefully establishing a dictionary between the geometry of the CY4 and the QFT in the transverse directions remains, to a large extent, an unresolved challenge, complicated by subtleties arising from M5-brane instanton corrections. Such difficulties can be circumvented in the restricted and yet controlled setting offered by CY4 with terminal singularities, as they do not admit crepant resolutions with compact exceptional divisors. After a general review of their properties and partial classifications, we focus on a subclass of terminal CY4 constructed as deformed Du Val singularities, that admit crepant resolutions with at most exceptional 2-cycles. We extract the corresponding 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory descendant in an unambiguous fashion, as the absence of compact 4-cycles leaves no room for a choice of background $G_4$ flux. These turn out to be theories of chiral multiplets with no gauge group and at most abelian flavor factors: we argue that they serve as the simplest building blocks to substantiate a rigorous CY4/3d QFT geometric engineering mapping.</description>

      <title>A note on loop resummation in de Sitter spacetime with the wavefunction of the universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the computation of $n$-point correlation functions in de Sitter spacetime, including loop corrections, using the wavefunction of the universe approach. This method consists of two stages employing distinct Feynman rules. First, one must compute the wavefunction coefficients using interactions as vertices. Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using wavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in the first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the question of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained via other methods. By considering a scalar field with an arbitrary potential, we compute $n$-point correlation functions to first order in the potential but to all orders in loops. We find that, although loop integrals in the first stage are indeed IR convergent, the second procedure reintroduces the IR divergence. We discuss how this induces renormalization of the interaction potential such that the final result combining both steps exactly matches the form of $n$-point functions previously calculated with other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Quantum field theories can exhibit various generalized symmetry structures, among which higher-group symmetries and non-invertible symmetry defects are particularly prominent. In this work, we explore a new general scenario in which these two structures are intertwined. This phenomenon arises in four dimensions when gauging one of multiple $U(1)$ 0-form symmetries in the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We illustrate this with two distinct models that flow to an IR gapless phase and a gapped phase, respectively, and examine how this symmetry structure manifests in each case. Additionally, we investigate a five-dimensional model where a similar structure exists intrinsically. Our main tool is a symmetry TQFT in one higher dimension, formulated using non-compact gauge fields and having infinitely many topological operators. We carefully determine its boundary conditions and provide a detailed discussion on various dressing choices for its bulk topological operators.</description>

      <title>Remarks on nonperturbative perturbations</title>

Abstract: We consider the linearized perturbations of near-horizon extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in $d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and seven-dimensional third-order Lovelock gravity. We find the solutions for the gravitational perturbations as a function of the higher-derivative coupling coefficients, which we treat nonperturbatively. Consequently, we observe a breakdown in perturbation theory for large harmonics for the six-derivative corrections.</description>

      <title>The integrable Bullough-Dodd model under celestial holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study celestial amplitudes for the S-matrix of the 2d integrable Bullough-Dodd model. This model has bound states that appear as poles in the physics strip of its 2d S-matrix, which complicates the computation of celestial amplitudes. However, it turns out that the celestial amplitudes are, in fact, well-structured. The celestial bootstrap (arising from the unitarity and crossing symmetry of 2d S-matrix) can be decomposed into a finite-dimensional linear space, whose base-integrals evaluate into harmonic numbers. This clean structure replaces the complicated integration with simple algebra of elementary functions, and the celestial bootstrap reduces to a programmable recursion process of simple algebra. Interestingly, this linear space has a subspace that happens to cover the celestial bootstrap of the Sinh-Gordon model studied by 2209.02776. So the celestial dual of these 2d integrable models turns out to be 'bootstrapable' in the practical sense, that is, a programmable recursion process.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Renormalization, Decoupling and the Hierarchy Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with renormalization and decoupling. We can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics through the decoupling of heavy fields. It is essential to correctly identify the observable physical mass as the renormalized one that depends on the external momentum, as opposed to the constant mass. We reconsider the properties of the renormalized loop corrections, which are finite, independent of regularization and admit a well-defined perturbation. By explicit calculation, we show that any loop corrections to the scalar mass-squared are suppressed as $(p^2-m^2)^2/M^2$, where $p,m$ and $M$ are the external momentum, the scalar pole mass and the heavy field mass in the loop, respectively. This is in accordance with the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, which we have explicitized and completed for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds in Scalar Effective Field Theories at One-loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameters in an effective field theory can be subject to certain positivity bounds if one requires a UV completion that obeys the fundamental principles of quantum field theory. These bounds are relatively straightforward at the tree level, but would become more obscure when loop effects are important. Using scalar theories as examples, we carefully exam the positivity bounds in a case where the leading contribution to a forward elastic amplitude arises at the one-loop level, and point out certain subtleties in terms of the implications of positivity bounds on the theory parameter space. In particular, the one-loop generated dimension-8 operator coefficients (that would be positive if generated at the tree level), as well as their $\beta$-functions are generally not subject to positivity bounds as they might correspond to interference terms of the cross sections under the optical theorem, which could have either sign. A strict positivity bound can only be implied when all contributions at the same loop order are considered, including the ones from dim-4 and dim-6 operator coefficients, which have important effects at the one-loop level. Our results may have important implications on the robustness of experimental tests of positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Minimal dark matter in $SU(5)$ grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal dark matter is an attractive candidate for dark matter because it is stabilized without the need to impose additional symmetries. It is known that the $SU(2)_L$ quintuplet fermion can serve as a minimal dark matter candidate, with its mass predicted to be around $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, based on the thermal production mechanism. In this work, we embed the quintuplet dark matter within nonsupersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theories. We find that two pairs of colored sextet fermions are required at the $\mathcal{O}(1-10)~\mathrm{TeV}$ scale to achieve gauge coupling unification, with the unification scale near the reduced Planck scale. These colored sextet fermions become metastable because their interactions are suppressed by the unification scale. Our model can be tested through comprehensive searches for colored sextet fermions in collider experiments, as well as through indirect and direct detection methods for minimal dark matter. Once the minimal dark matter scenario has been experimentally confirmed, it will have implications for modifying string theories.</description>
