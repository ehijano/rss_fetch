      <title>The Lagrangian and symplectic structures of the Kuramoto oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly. Based on this result perturbation analysis around (unstable) Kuramoto equilibria are shown to be equivalent to low-energy fluctuations of mean-field Heisenberg spin models.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the dyadic Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two formulations for the computation of the dyadic Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in layered media are presented in details. The first formulation derived using TE/TM decomposition is well-known and intensively used in engineering community while the second formulation derived using vector potential and a matrix basis is recently used in establishing a fast multipole method. We significantly simplify the derivation of second formulation and show that it is equivalent to the first one while the derivation is more straightforward as the interface conditions are directly decoupled using the vector potential. The matrix basis is designed to split out all non-symmetric factors in the density functions which facilitates the derivation of far-field approximations for the dyadic Green's functions. Moreover, it can be applied to the computation of the dyadic Green's functions of elastic wave equation in layered media.</description>

      <title>Bethe Vectors in Quantum Integrable Models with Classical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to give a precise and simple definition for off-shell Bethe vectors in a generic $g$-invariant integrable model for $g=gl_n$, $o_{2n+1}$, $sp_{2n}$ and $o_{2n}$. We prove from our definition that the off-shell Bethe vectors indeed become on-shell when the Bethe equations are obeyed.
  Then, we show that some properties for these off-shell Bethe vectors, such as the action formulas of monodromy entries on these vectors, their rectangular recurrence relations and their coproduct formula, are a consequence of our definition.</description>

      <title>The Ground State Energy of a Mean-Field Fermi Gas in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously establish a formula for the correlation energy of a two-dimensional Fermi gas in the mean-field regime for potentials whose Fourier transform $\hat{V}$ satisfies $\hat{V}(\cdot) | \cdot | \in \ell^1$. Further, we establish the analogous upper bound for $\hat{V}(\cdot)^2 | \cdot |^{1 + \varepsilon} \in \ell^1$, which includes the Coulomb potential $\hat{V}(k) \sim |k|^{-2}$. The proof is based on an approximate bosonization using slowly growing patches around the Fermi surface. In contrast to recent proofs in the three-dimensional case, we need a refined analysis of low-energy excitations, as they are less numerous, but carry larger contributions.</description>

      <title>Transpositional rule for constrained systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of nonholonomic mechanical systems, focusing on fundamental variational assumptions and the role of the transpositional rule. We analyze how the Cetaev condition and the first variation of constraints define compatible virtual displacements for systems subject to kinematic constraints, including those nonlinear in generalized velocities. The study explores the necessary conditions for commutation relations to hold, clarifying their impact on the consistency of the derived equations of motion. By detailing the interplay between these variational identities and the Lagrangian derivatives of constraint functions, we elucidate the differences between equations of motion formulated via the d'Alembert--Lagrange principle and those obtained from extended time-integral variational principles. This work aims to provide a clearer theoretical framework for applying these core principles to nonholonomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A compellingly simple proof of the speed of sound for interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On physical grounds, one expects locally interacting quantum many-body systems to feature a finite group velocity. This intuition is rigorously underpinned by Lieb-Robinson bounds that state that locally interacting Hamiltonians with finite-dimensional constituents on suitably regular lattices always exhibit such a finite group velocity. This also implies that causality is always respected by the dynamics of quantum lattice models. It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved. This work proves a strikingly simple such bound for particle propagation - shown in literally a few elementary, yet not straightforward, lines - for generalized Bose-Hubbard models defined on general lattices, proving that appropriately locally perturbed stationary states feature a finite speed of sound in particle numbers.</description>

      <title>The universal logic of repeated experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{E}$ be the event space of an experiment that can be indefinitely repeated, in such a way that the result of one repetition does not affect the result of the other. A natural question arises: given a countable cardinal $\kappa$, which is the event space of the $\kappa$-times repeated experiment? In the case of classical experiments, where $\mathsf{E}$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra on some set $S$, i.e. a \textit{classical }or\textit{ distributive logic}, the answer is more and less known: the (complete) Boolean algebra on $S^{\kappa}$ generated by $\mathsf{E}^{\kappa}$. But, what if $\mathsf{E}$ is not a Boolean algebra? In this paper we give a constructive answer to this question for any $\kappa$ and in the context of general orthocomplemented complete lattices, i.e. \textit{general logics}. Concretely, given a general logic $\mathsf{E}$ defining the event space of a given experiment, we construct a logic $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ representing the event space of the $\kappa$-times repeated experiment, in such a way that $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ and $\mathsf{E}$ are isomorphic if $\kappa=1$, and such that $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ is distributive if and only if so is $\mathsf{E}$. We also extend our construction to the case in which the event space changes from one repetition to another and the cardinal $\kappa$ is arbitrary. This gives rise to tensor products $\bigotimes_{\alpha\in\kappa}\mathsf{E}_{\alpha}$ of families $\left\{ \mathsf{E}_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in\kappa}$ of orthocomplemented complete lattices, in terms of which $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)=\bigotimes_{\alpha\in\kappa}\mathsf{E}$.</description>

      <title>Existence and (in)stability of standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations on looping-edge graphs with $\delta'$-type interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and orbital (in)stability of several branches of standing--wave solutions for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on a looping--edge graph $\mathcal{G}$, consisting of a circle and a finite number $N$ of infinite half--lines attached to a common vertex. The model is endowed with $\delta'$--type interaction boundary conditions at the vertex, which enforce continuity of the derivatives of the wave functions, while continuity of the wave function itself is not required. By means of the Implicit Function Theorem, we establish the existence of families of standing--wave profiles that converge, on the circular component of the graph, to Jacobi elliptic solutions of dnoidal type, coupled with soliton--type tail profiles on the half--lines. Tools from perturbation theory and Kre\u{\i}n--von Neumann extension theory for symmetric operators play a central role in the (in)stability analysis of such standing wave solutions. Our approach may be extended to other bound states for the NLS on looping graphs or more general non--compact metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Cohomology, BRST Quantization, and Analytic Localization: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed exposition of the two main models for equivariant cohomology -- the Cartan and Weil models -- and their explicit isomorphism via the Kalkman (Mathai--Quillen) transformation. We then connect this framework to the BRST quantization of gauge theories, showing how the BRST complex can be identified with the Cartan model. Viewing both the Kalkman transformation and Witten's Morse-theoretic deformation as gauge-fixing procedures leads naturally to the \emph{equivariant Witten deformation}. This combined perspective yields a transparent analytic proof of the Atiyah--Bott--Berline--Vergne (ABBV) localization formula for integrals of equivariantly closed forms.The theory is richly illustrated with computations on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\mathbb{CP}^n$, supplemented by explicit coordinate calculations.</description>

      <title>Nature is stingy: Universality of Scrooge ensembles in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Events during transition to turbulence either follow modal or non-modal routes, or combinations of the two. Here, we report a computational investigation of strong freestream excitation caused by a train of convecting vortices. For this TCV excitation, we show a strong interaction of modal and non-modal components causing a spectacular growth of disturbances. We propose this as the mechanism for the severe encounters due to convective vortical disturbances on the underlying shear layer.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp nonuniqueness result for the forced generalized SQG equation. First, this yields nonunique $\dot{H}^s$- energy solutions below the Miura-Ju class. In particular, this shows that the solutions constructed by Resnick and Marchand for the dissipative SQG equation are not necessarily unique. Second, this establishes nonuniqueness below the Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin class for the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, as well as below the Constantin-Wu and Dong-Chen-Zhao-Liu classes for the dissipative SQG equation.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise from Electron-Hole Asymmetry in Normal and Superconducting Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines $\Delta_T$ noise in two-terminal hybrid nanostructures featuring a quantum point contact (QPC), realized either between two normal metals (NQN) or between a normal metal and a superconductor (NQS). The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\Delta_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\Delta_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.</description>

      <title>Large-party limit of topological entanglement entropy in Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological entanglement entropy of quantum states arising in the context of three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{dm,dn}$ torus link complements, which is a $d$-party pure quantum state, and analyze its large-party limit, i.e., $d\to \infty$ limit. We show that the entanglement measures in this limit will receive contributions only from the Abelian anyons, and non-Abelian sectors are suppressed in the large-party limit. Consequently, the large-party limiting value of the entanglement entropy has an upper bound of $\ln |Z_G|$, where $|Z_G|$ is the order of the center of the group $G$. As an explicit example, we perform quantitative analysis for the simplest case of the SU(2) group and $T_{d,dn}$ torus link to obtain the large-party limit of the entanglement entropy. We further investigate the semiclassical ($k \to \infty$) limit of the entropies after taking the large-party limit for this particular example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ergodic properties of a unitary Floquet dynamics arising from the repeated application of a translationally-invariant Clifford Quantum Cellular Automata to an infinite system of qubits in d dimensions. One expects that if the QCA does not exhibit any periodicity, a generic initial state of qubits will thermalize, that is, approach the infinite-temperature state. We show that this is true for many classes of states, both pure and mixed. In particular, this is true for all initial states that are short-range entangled and close to the equilibrium state.

      <title>Geometric Complexity of Quantum Channels via Unitary Dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological stability of Voronoi percolation in higher dimensions. We show that slightly increasing p allows a discretization that preserves increasing topological properties with high probability. This strengthens a theorem of Bollob\'as and Riordan and generalizes it to higher dimensions. As a consequence, we prove a sharp phase transition for the emergence of i-dimensional giant cycles in Voronoi percolation on the 2i-dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian representation of isomonodromic deformations of twisted rational connections: The Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Finding All Solutions of qKZ Equations in Characteristic $p$</title>

Abstract: In [J. Lond. Math. Soc. 109 (2024), e12884, 22 pages, arXiv:2208.09721], the difference qKZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$ and a family of polynomial solutions of the qKZ equations modulo $p$ was constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper, we study in detail the first family of nontrivial examples of the qKZ equations in characteristic $p$. We describe all solutions of these qKZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We also prove a Lagrangian property (called the orthogonality property) of the subbundle of the qKZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections. This paper extends the results of [arXiv:2405.05159] on the differential KZ equations to the difference qKZ equations.</description>

      <title>Contact Lie systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces: from scaling symmetries to curvature-dependent reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of the notion of scaling symmetries for the case of Lie-Hamilton systems, allowing their subsequent reduction to contact Lie systems. As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes. Under certain topological conditions, some of these systems retrieve well-known two-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through a curvature-dependent reduction.</description>

Abstract: The irrational torus, $\mathrm{T}_\alpha$, originally introduced as a geometric model for quasicrystals, is a foundational object in the theory of diffeology. This paper, after recalling its main algebraic properties, provides a comprehensive analysis of a new geometric invariant for this singular space: the group of flows, $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R})$. This invariant, which is trivial for all manifolds, arises as the core of the obstruction to the de Rham theorem in the diffeological setting. We provide a complete computation and geometric interpretation of this group, proving the isomorphism $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R}) \simeq \mathbf{R} \times \mathrm{coker}(\Delta_\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry transformation group arising from the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler problem in classical mechanics exhibits a rich structure of conserved quantities, highlighted by the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector. Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated.</description>

      <title>From Yang-Mills to Yang-Baxter: In Memory of Rodney Baxter and Chen--Ning Yang</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The year 2025 marked the passing of two towering figures of twentieth-century mathematical physics, Rodney Baxter and Chen-Ning Yang. Yang reshaped modern physics through the introduction of non-abelian gauge theory and, independently, through the consistency conditions underlying what is now called the Yang-Baxter equation. Baxter transformed those conditions into a systematic theory of exact solvability in statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems. This article is written in memory of Baxter and Yang, whose work revealed how local consistency principles generate global mathematical structure. We review the Yang-Mills formulation of gauge theory, its mass obstruction and resolution via symmetry breaking, and the geometric framework it engendered, including instantons, Donaldson-Floer theory, magnetic monopoles, and Hitchin systems. In parallel, we trace the emergence of the Yang-Baxter equation from factorised scattering to solvable lattice models, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons theory. Rather than separate narratives, gauge theory and integrability are presented as complementary manifestations of a shared coherence principle, an ongoing journey from gauge symmetry toward mathematical unity.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Attached Eddy in Wall Turbulence: Statistical Foundations, Inverse Identification and Influence Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis models the logarithmic region of high Reynolds number wall turbulence as a random superposition of wall-attached, geometrically self-similar eddies whose sizes obey a scale-invariant population law. Building on the statistical framework of Woodcock and Marusic (2015), the present work (i) poses an inverse problem to infer the ideal single-eddy contribution (influence) functions for the mean velocity and Reynolds stresses from DNS moments, (ii) uses these inferred kernels to guide a minimal Biot-Savart-consistent hairpin-type eddy built from Rankine vortex rods together with an inviscid image system, and (iii) introduces a spectral Influence kernel that maps a self-similar eddy footprint to its one-dimensional energy spectrum. The Influence-kernel viewpoint yields a transparent explanation for the emergence (and limitations) of the linear part of the energy spectrum, provides a clear scale-by-scale decomposition and helps rationalize why simple eddy templates can reproduce a broad set of log-layer statistics once the mean-flow anchoring is fixed.</description>

Abstract: This is an introduction to calculus, and its applications to basic questions from physics. We first discuss the theory of functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, with the notion of continuity, and the construction of the derivative $f'(x)$ and of the integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$. Then we investigate the case of the complex functions $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$, and notably the holomorphic functions, and harmonic functions. Then, we discuss the multivariable functions, $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb R^M$ or $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb C^M$ or $f:\mathbb C^N\to\mathbb C^M$, with general theory, integration results, maximization questions, and basic applications to physics.</description>

Abstract: In light of recent work in the global well-posedness of solutions for an ionic Vlasov-Poisson system, as demonstrated by Griffin-Pickering and Iacobelli, the current work focuses on the moment propagation of the corresponding system in quasi-neutral regime. Such moment propagation result relies on an estimate of $Q_*(t)=|V(t;0,x,v)-V(0;0,x,v)|$, where $V(s;t,x,v)$ represents the solution of the characteristic ordinary differential equation associated with the Vlasov-Poisson system.</description>

Abstract: We study higher spin (pure and mixed spin) representations of the Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We provide a geometric realization in terms of the critical cohomology of representations of the quiver with potential of Bykov and Zinn-Justin [BZJ20]. When the framing dimension is 1, it recovers the evaluation pullback of the $\ell+1$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We introduce the lattice model and prove that its partition function coincides with the weight function constructed using the framed shuffle formula. The latter follows the approach of Rim\'anyi, Tarasov and Varchenko [RTV15].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\mathcal{SP}$. This result can be regarded as a distant analogue of the classical Bertrand's theorem (1873), which characterizes centrally symmetric potentials in the presence of an abundance of periodic orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically a recent BGK-type model for a multi-component mixture of monatomic gases, undergoing a reversible bimolecular chemical reaction. The model replaces each collisional term of the Boltzmann equation with a relaxation term, thereby describing separately the effects of the mechanical processes and the chemical reaction. Additionally, the model exhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when auxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We assume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the macroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward thermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the equalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the monotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that, when initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional is not monotone during the initial transient.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of inter-species interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the relaxation of the distribution functions to equilibrium is shown through entropy dissipation. Some numerical simulations are included to investigate the trend to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>One-Point Restricted Conformal Blocks and the Fusion Tensor Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-point restriction of conformal blocks on $(\mathbb{P}^1,\infty,1,0)$ associated with modules over a vertex operator algebra. By restricting the module attached to the point $\infty$ to its bottom degree, we obtain a new formula for computing fusion rules in terms of a left $A(V)$-module $M^1\odot M^2$ over the Zhu algebra $A(V)$. As a consequence, for strongly rational VOAs, the construction of $M^1\odot M^2$ induces the fusion tensor product on the module category $\mathsf{Mod}(A(V))$.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems from kinetic models for bacterial communities on a leaf surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description>

      <title>Genus zero Whitham hierarchy via Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: B. Dubrovin introduced the structure of a Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold on a space of ramified coverings of a sphere by a genus $g$ Riemann surface with the prescribed ramification profile. This is now known as a genus $g$ Hurwitz--Frobenius manifold. We investigate the genus zero Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds and their connection to the integrable hierarchies. In particular, we prove that the Frobenius potentials of the genus zero Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds stabilize and therefore define an infinite system of commuting PDEs. We show that this system of PDEs is equivalent to the genus zero Whitham hierarchy of I. Krichever. Our result shows that this system of PDEs has both Fay form, depending heavily on the flat structure fo the Hurwitz--Frobenius manifold and coordinatefree Lax form. We also show how to extend this system of PDEs to the multicomponent KP hierarchy via the $\hbar$--deformation of the differential operators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>

      <title>Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop groups and Drinfeld double of preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive/negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,\pm,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the (opposite) algebra of the integral preprojective (nilpotent) $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ ($(\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q})^{op}$) of the same quiver type $Q$. As the application, we prove that one can identify the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO,\mathbb{Z}}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ as the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ in the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ as the quasitriangular Hopf $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_e^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras. Moreover we use the freeness of the wall subalgebra in MO quantum loop groups to prove the freeness of the preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra for arbitrary torus $\mathbb{C}_q^*\subset A\subset T$.</description>

      <title>Distortion of charge distribution due to internal electric fields described by the drift-diffusion semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Quantum Codes Beyond the Pauli Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional derivative-free optimization. A case study on minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents an evaluation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for the direct minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals involving nonlinear orbital parameters and quantum numbers with noninteger order. The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters. This work presents the first systematic investigation of derivative-free optimization methods for Hartree-Fock$-$Roothaan energy minimization with non-integer Slater orbitals.</description>
