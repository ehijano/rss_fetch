      <title>Global Dynamics of the Non-Radial Energy-Critical Inhomogeneous Biharmonic NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear biharmonic Schr\"odinger equation \[ i\partial_t u + \Delta^2 u - |x|^{-b}|u|^p u = 0 \quad \text{on } \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^N, \] in the energy-critical regime, $p = \frac{8 - 2b}{N - 4}$, and $5 \leq N &lt; 12$. We focus on the challenging non-radial setting and establish global well-posedness and scattering under the subcritical assumption $ \sup_{t \in I} \|\Delta u(t)\|_{L^2} &lt; \|\Delta W\|_{L^2}, $ where $W$ denotes the ground state solution to the associated elliptic equation.
  In contrast to previous results in the homogeneous case ($b = 0$), which often rely on radial symmetry and conserved quantities, our analysis is carried out without symmetry assumptions and under a non-conserved quantity, the kinetic energy. The presence of spatial inhomogeneity combined with the fourth-order dispersive operator introduces substantial analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we develop a refined concentration-compactness and rigidity framework, based on the Kenig-Merle approach \cite{KM}, but more directly inspired by recent work of Murphy and the first author \cite{CM} in the second-order inhomogeneous setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast with a large variety of conventional models of thermally driven fluids, we show that the standard Oberbeck--Boussinesq approximation \emph{cannot} be obtained as a singular limit of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier system in the rotational coordinate system, with the buoyancy force proportional to the sum of the gravitational and centrifugal forces multiplied by the temperature variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a variational algorithm, in the spirit of the minimizing movements scheme, to model the volume-preserving anisotropic mean curvature flow in 2D. We show that this algorithm can be used to prove the existence of classical solutions. Moreover, we prove that this algorithm converges to the global solution of the equation.</description>

      <title>Discrete Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities and ground state solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the discrete Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{N}$ ($N\geq 1$) in a broader range of parameters than the classical continuous version [8]: \[ \parallel u\parallel_{\ell_{b}^{q}}\leq C(a,b,c,p,q,r,\theta,N)\parallel u\parallel_{D_{a}^{1,p}}^{\theta}\parallel u\parallel_{\ell_{c}^{r}}^{1-\theta},\:\forall u\in D_{a,0}^{1,p}(\mathbb{Z}^{N}) \cap \ell_c ^r(\mathbb{Z}^{N}), \] where $p,q,r&gt;1,0\leq\theta\leq1$, $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{a}{N}&gt;0,\frac{1}{r}+\frac{c}{N}&gt;0,b\leq\theta a+(1-\theta)c,$$\frac{1}{q^{\ast}}+\frac{b}{N}= \theta(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{a-1}{N})+(1-\theta)(\frac{1}{r}+\frac{c}{N})$ and $q\geq q^{\ast}$. For two special cases $\theta=1,a=0$ and $a=b=c=0$, by the discrete Schwarz rearrangement established in [24], we prove the existence of extremal functions for the best constants in the supercritical case $q&gt;q^{\ast}$. As an application, we get positive ground state solutions to the nonlinear elliptic equations.</description>

      <title>Zero-relaxation and vanishing-damping limits of pressureless Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the one-dimensional pressureless Euler system with relaxation in the Radon measure space. As the relaxation time tends to zero, the entropy solution converges to a static solution with the density converging to its initial value. As the relaxation time tends to infinity, which means the damping vanishes, the entropy solution of damped pressureless Euler system converges to that of pressureless Euler system.</description>

      <title>Modeling Carreau fluid flows through a very thin porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates three-dimensional, steady-state, and non-Newtonian flows within a very thin porous medium (VTPM). The medium is modeled as a domain confined between two parallel plates and perforated by solid cylinders that connect the plates and are distributed periodically in perpendicular directions. We denote the order of magnitude of the thickness of the domain by $\epsilon$ and define the period and order of magnitude of the cylinders' diameter by $\epsilon$^l, where 0 &lt; l &lt; 1 is fixed. In other words, we consider the regime $\epsilon$ $\ll$ $\epsilon$^l. We assume that the viscosity of the non-Newtonian fluid follows Carreau's law and is scaled by a factor of $\epsilon$^$\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is a real number. Using asymptotic techniques with respect to the thickness of the domain, we perform a new, complete study of the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid as $\epsilon$ tends to zero. Our mathematical analysis is based on deriving sharp a priori estimates through pressure decomposition, and on compactness results for the rescaled velocity and pressure, obtained using the unfolding method. Depending on $\gamma$ and the flow index r, we rigorously derive different linear and nonlinear reduced limit systems. These systems allow us to obtain explicit expressions for the filtration velocity and simpler Darcy's laws for limit pressure.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of flow in inflatable periodic structures with nonlinear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new type of weakly nonlinear two-scale model of inflatable periodic poroelastic structures saturated by Newtonian fluids. The periodic microstructures incorporate fluid inclusions connected to the fluid channels by admission and ejection valves respected by a 0D model. This induces a nonlinearity in the macroscopic Biot-type model, whereby the Darcy flow model governs the fluid transport due to the channels. Moreover, the fluid channels consist of compartments separated by semipermeable membranes inducing the pressure discontinuity. The homogenized model is derived under the small deformation assumption, however the equilibrium is considered in the Eulerian frame. Deformation-dependent homogenized coefficients of the incremental poroelasticity constitutive law and the permeability are approximated using the sensitivity analysis, to avoid coupled two-scale iterations. Numerical simulations illustrate the inflation process in time. Example of a bi-material cantilever demonstrates the inflation induced bending. The proposed two-scale model is intended to provide a computational tool for designing of porous metamaterials for fluid transport, or shape morphing with various potential applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate transonic shock solution for hypersonic flow past a large curved convex wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of a global transonic shock generated by hypersonic potential flow over a large curved convex wedge. Modeling 2-dimensional steady potential flow leads to a free boundary value problem of quasilinear equation. By applying the hodograph transformation, in which one of the coordinate is the unknown function, this problem is reduced to a free boundary value problem of linear equation. For hypersonic incoming flow with adiabatic index $\gamma=2$, we construct an approximate boundary based on the asymptotic state. Then, within the region defined by this approximate boundary, we solve a narrow-region elliptic boundary value problem. This solution serves as the approximate solution to the free boundary problem that we seek. Utilizing uniform weighted Schauder estimates for the elliptic mixed boundary value problem in the narrow region, we obtain an error estimate for the free boundary.</description>

      <title>Global solvability for doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system with a wide range of bacterial responses in physical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of bacteria's response to environmental conditions, we consider the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{align*} \begin{cases} u_t=\nabla\cdot(uv\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u^{\alpha}v\nabla v)+\ell uv,\\ v_t=\Delta v-uv, \end{cases} \end{align*} subjected to no-flux boundary conditions and smooth initial data, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is the bacterial response parameter. Global solvability of weak solutions to this taxis system is highly challenging due to not only the doubly nonlinear diffusion and its degeneracy but also the strong chemotactic effect, where the latter is strong at the large species density if $\alpha$ is close to $2$ or at the small species density if $\alpha&lt;0$. Recent findings on the global weak solvability for the considered system are summarised as follows \begin{itemize} \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 2021] for $\alpha=2$, $N=1$; \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2024] for $1\le\alpha\le 2$, $N=2$ with initial data of small size if $\alpha=2$; \item In [Z. Zhang and Y. Li, \textit{arXiv:2405.20637}, 2024] for $\alpha=2$, $N=2$; and \item In [G. Li, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2022] for $\frac{7}{6}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{13}{9}$, $N=3$. \end{itemize} Our work aims to provide a picture of global weak solvability for $0\le\alpha&lt;2$ in the physically dimensional setting $N=3$. As suggested by the analysis, it is divided into three separable cases, including (i) $0\le\alpha\le 1$: Weak chemotaxis effect; (ii) $1&lt;\alpha\le 3/2$: Moderate chemotaxis effect; and (iii) $3/2&lt;\alpha&lt;2$: Strong chemotaxis effect.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of One-Dimensional Nonlinear Diffusion Equations with a Fourth-Type Dynamic Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a one-dimensional diffusion equation equipped with a dynamic boundary condition and an additional boundary condition that renders the one-dimensional Laplace operator self-adjoint. The equation serves as a model for describing filtration in aquaria, originally introduced by the author and Kitahata. The boundary condition treated in this work differs from classical types such as Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions; we refer to it as the fourth or FK-type boundary condition. The boundary condition is designed to capture interactions between the two boundaries in the context of filtration. The framework for establishing well-posedness is based on L^p-L^q maximal regularity classes.</description>

      <title>The non-isothermal Maxwell-Stefan asymptotics of the multi-species Boltzmann equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence from the multi-species Boltzmann equations to the non-isothermal Maxwell-Stefan system. The global-in-time well-posedness of the Maxwell-Stefan system is first established. The solution is utilized as the fluid quantities to construct a local Maxwellian vector. The Maxwell-Stefan system can be derived from the multi-species Boltzmann equations under diffusive scaling by adding a relation on the total concentration. Different with the classical hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equations, the Maxwellian based on the Maxwell-Stefan system is not a local equilibrium for the mixtures due to cross-interactions. A local coercivity property for the operator linearized around the local Maxwellian is established, based on the explicit spectral gap of the operator linearized around the global equilibrium. The global-in-time solution to the multi-species Boltzmann equations uniform in Knudsen number $\varepsilon$ is established in this scaling, thus the first non-isothermal Maxwell-Stefan asymptotics is rigorously justified. This generalizes Bondesan and Briant's work \cite{briant2021stability} from isothermal to non-isothermal case.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper [S. Alinhac, The null condition for quasilinear wave equations in two space dimensions I, Invent. Math. 145 (2001), no. 3, 597-618], S. Alinhac established the global existence of small data smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions. However, for the corresponding 2-D initial boundary value problem in exterior domains, it is still open whether the global solutions exist. When the 2-D quadratic nonlinearity admits a special $Q_0$ type null form, the global small solution is shown in our previous article [Hou Fei, Yin Huicheng, Yuan Meng, Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, arXiv:2411.06984]. In the present paper, we now solve this open problem through proving the global existence of small solutions to 2-D general quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains. Our proof procedure is based on finding appropriate divergence structures of quasilinear wave equations under null conditions, introducing a good unknown to eliminate the resulting $Q_0$ type nonlinearity and deriving some new precise pointwise spacetime decay estimates of solutions and their derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions, (with $\beta\in\R\setminus\{0\}$ the Robin parameter), we consider a shape minimization problem for a function of the first eigenvalues if $\beta&gt;0$ and a shape maximization problem if $\beta&lt;0$. Both problems are settled in a suitable class of generalized polygons with an upper bound on the number of sides, under either perimeter or volume constraint.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate further qualitative properties of statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation (SME) and the Binormal Curvature Flow (BCF), continuing the work initiated by E. G., M. Hofmanov\'a. Concerning the statistically stationary solutions to the SME, we show that the laws of some relevant observables (such as the space average and the energy) are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, with a Gaussian decay property for the energy. We further prove that the law $\mu$ of the statistically stationary solution has dimension of at least two: this means that any compact set of Hausdorff dimension smaller than two has $\mu$-measure zero. These properties, with appropriate modifications of the norms, pass directly to the statistically stationary solutions to the BCF.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness problem for Prandtl spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of uniqueness of a divergence-free velocity field with vorticity given by the Prandtl spiral. We show that if the class of admissible velocities is restricted to those satisfying the velocity matching condition and an appropriate decay condition at the origin of the spiral, then the velocity field is uniquely determined. We subsequently extend the result to the case of fields with vorticity composed of unions of concentric logarithmic spirals. As a by-product, we derive an alternative way of deriving formula for the velocity corresponding to the Prandtl spirals. The proof relies on an approach that is of independent interest. We construct an explicit conformal map from the exterior of a logarithmic spiral onto a strip. This transformation reduces the problem to establishing the uniqueness of a holomorphic function defined on the strip, under non-standard boundary and decay conditions.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of discrete velocity kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long time behavior of some nonlinear discrete velocity kinetic equations in the one and three dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. We prove the exponential time decay of solutions towards the global equilibrium in the $L^2$ space. Our result holds for a wide class of interaction rates including the Goldstein-Taylor and Carleman equations, and the estimates on the rate of convergence are explicit and constructive. The technique is based on the construction of suitable Lyapunov functionals by modifying Boltzmann's entropy.</description>

      <title>Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced models for free-surface flows are required due to the high dimensionality of the underlying incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which need to fully resolve the flow in vertical direction to compute the surface height. On the other hand, standard reduced models, such as the classical Shallow Water Equations (SWE), which assume a small depth-to-length ratio and use depth-averaging, do not provide information about the vertical velocity profile variations. As a compromise, a recently proposed moment approach for shallow flow using Legendre polynomials as ansatz functions for vertical velocity variations showed the derivation of so-called Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) that combine low dimensionality with velocity profile modeling. However, only global polynomials are considered so far.
  This paper introduces Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations (SSWME) where piecewise defined spline ansatz functions allow for a flexible representation of velocity profiles with lower regularity. The local support of the spline basis functions opens up the possibility of adaptability and greater flexibility regarding some typical profile shapes. We systematically derive and analyze hierarchies of SSWME models with different number of basis functions and different degrees, before deriving a regularized hyperbolic version by performing a hyperbolic regularization with analytical proof of hyperbolicity for a hierarchy of high-order SSWME models. Numerical simulations show high accuracy and robustness of the new models.</description>

      <title>Quenching time and probability estimates for a stochastic reaction-diffusion system with coupled inner singular absorption terms driven by mixed noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a stochastic parabolic system under Robin boundary conditions, for which the deterministic counterpart exhibits finite quenching. The stochastic system incorporates mixed noise, combining standard one-dimensional Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion. Under appropriate assumptions, we derive explicit lower and upper bounds for the quenching time of the solution and establish the global existence of a weak solution. Leveraging Malliavin calculus, we further obtain a quantifiable lower and upper bound on the quenching probability. To complement the theoretical analysis, we design a numerical scheme tailored to the system and present results that validate the analytical predictions, offering insights into the interplay between noise and quenching behaviour.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}-Stratonovich Conversion in Infinite Dimensions for Unbounded, Time-Dependent, Nonlinear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a solution, in a variational framework, to the Stratonovich stochastic partial differential equation with noise $G\left(t, \Psi_t\right) \circ dW_t$ is given by a solution to the It\^{o} equation with It\^{o}-Stratonovich corrector $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^\infty D_uG_i\left(t, \Psi_t\right)\left[G_i(t,\Psi_t)\right]dt$. Here $G_i$ denotes the action of $G$ on the $i^{th}$ component of the cylindrical noise, and $D_uG_i$ its Fr\'{e}chet partial derivative in the Hilbert space for which the It\^{o} form is satisfied. The noise operator $G$ may be time-dependent, nonlinear, and unbounded in the sense of differential operators; in the latter case, one must pass to a larger space in order to solve the Stratonovich equation. Our proof relies on martingale techniques, and the results apply to fluid equations with time-dependent and nonlinear transport noise.</description>

      <title>Einstein Type Systems on Complete Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the coupled Einstein Constraint Equations (ECE) on complete manifolds through the conformal method, focusing on non-compact manifolds with flexible asymptotics. In particular, we do not impose any specific model for infinity being motivated to account for initial data sets of bounded geometry, which we take to be physically well motivated by standard cosmological space-times with non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces. First, we prove an existence criteria on compact manifolds with boundary which applies to more general systems and can be seen as a natural extension of known existence theory for the coupled ECE. Building on this, we prove an existence criterium on complete manifolds with appropriate barrier functions for a family of physically well-motivated coupled systems on complete manifolds. Finally, we build barrier functions and thus show existence in the bounded geometry case.</description>

      <title>Backward uniqueness of 2D and 3D convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the two- and three-dimensional convective Brinkman-Forchheimer (CBF) equations (or damped Navier--Stokes equations) on a torus $\mathbb{T}^d,$ $d\in\{2,3\}$:
  $$ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}-\mu \Delta\boldsymbol{u}+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+\alpha\boldsymbol{u}+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla p=\boldsymbol{f}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,$$ where $\mu,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$ and $r\in[1,\infty)$ is the absorption exponent. For $d=2,r\in[1,\infty)$ and $d=3,r\in[3,\infty)$ ($2\beta\mu\geq 1$ for $d=r=3$), we first show the backward uniqueness of deterministic CBF equations by exploiting the logarithmic convexity property and the global solvability results available in the literature. As a direct consequence of the backward uniqueness result, we first derive the approximate controllability with respect to the initial data (viewed as a start controller). Secondly, we apply the backward uniqueness results in the attractor theory to show the zero Lipschitz deviation of the global attractors for 2D and 3D CBF equations. By an application of log-Lipschitz regularity, we prove the uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories in 2D and 3D CBF flows and the continuity of Lagrangian trajectories with respect to the Eulerian initial data. Finally, we consider the stochastic CBF equations with a linear multiplicative Gaussian noise. For $d=2,r\in[1,\infty)$ and $d=3,r\in[3,5]$ ($2\beta\mu\geq 1$ for $d=r=3$), we show the pathwise backward uniqueness as well as approximate controllability via starter controller results.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove the $L^3$-based strong Onsager conjecture for the three-dimensional Euler equations. Our main theorem states that there exist weak solutions which dissipate the total kinetic energy, satisfy the local energy inequality, and belong to $C^0_t (W^{\frac 13-, 3} \cap L^{\infty-})$. More precisely, for every $\beta&lt;\frac 13$, we can construct such solutions in the space $C^0_t ( B^{\beta}_{3,\infty} \cap L^{\frac{1}{1-3\beta}} )$.</description>

Abstract: We present a stability result for ground states of a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in $(2+1)$ dimension, modelling the propagation of a light beam through a liquid crystal with nonlocal nonlinear response. A new uniqueness result for the ground state implies a coercivity bound for the second derivative of the action, and hence stability. In addition we prove existence of a ground state with frequency $\sigma$ for any $\sigma \in (0,1)$ as a minimal point over an appropriate Nehari manifold.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the heat equation with Grushin's operator. We present an expression for its heat kernel, prove its decay in $L^p$ spaces, and that it is an approximation of the identity. As a consequence, the heat semigroup associated with Grushin's operator using this heat kernel is estimated in Lebesgue spaces. Next, we use the results to prove the existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence, and blowup alternative of mild solutions of a nonlinear Cauchy problem associated with Grushin's operator. A global existence result is also presented.</description>

      <title>A shape optimization problem in cylinders and related overdetermined problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a shape optimization problem for the torsional energy associated with a domain contained in an infinite cylinder, under a volume constraint. We prove that a minimizer exists for all fixed volumes and show some of its geometric and topological properties. As this issue is closely related to the question of characterizing domains in cylinders that admit solutions to an overdetermined problem, our minimization result allows us to deduce interesting consequences in that direction. In particular, we find that, for some cylinders and some volumes, the ``trivial" domain given by a bounded cylinder is not the only domain where the overdetermined problem has a solution. Moreover, it is not even a minimizer, which indicates that solutions with flat level sets are not always the best candidates for optimizing the torsional energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of smooth, small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. Specifically, we investigate the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number if greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove existence of minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy for liquid crystals with homogeneous external magnetic field and strong uniaxial planar anchoring. Next we consider the asymptotics of solutions to the joint minimization of the energy w.r.t. the function and its boundary condition. This constitutes a generalization to arbitrary regular particle shapes of the results obtained in [BLS, arXiv:2403.20274] in a particular setting. Moreover, we show the absence of line singularities in some asymptotic parameter regime. Finally we characterize the optimal orientation of particles vis-\`a-vis the magnetic field direction and compute it explicitly for different particle shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on an approach introduced by Golovkin in the '60s, we show that nonuniqueness in some forced PDEs is a direct consequence of the existence of a self-similar linearly unstable eigenvalue: the key point is a clever choice of the forcing term removing complicated nonlinear interactions. We use this method to give a short and self-contained proof of nonuniqueness in 2D perfect fluids, first obtained in Vishik's groundbreaking result. In particular, we present a direct construction of a forced self-similar unstable vortex, where we treat perturbatively the self-similar operator in a new and more quantitative way.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions to a compressible fluid-particle interaction model with density-dependent friction force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a fluid-particle interaction model in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This model consists of the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations and the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation coupled together via the density-dependent friction force. Due to the strong coupling caused by the friction force, it is a challenging problem to construct the global existence and optimal decay rates of strong solutions. In this paper, by assuming that the $H^2$-norm of the initial data is sufficiently small, we establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions. Furthermore, if the $L^1$-norm of initial data is bounded, then we achieve the optimal decay rates of strong solutions and their gradients in $L^2$-norm. The proofs rely on developing refined energy estimates and exploiting the frequency decomposition method. In addition, for the periodic domain case, our global strong solutions decay exponentially.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the following quasilinear {S}chr\"{o}dinger equation: $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} - {\Delta u} - \frac{\kappa }{2}\Delta \left( {u}^{2}\right) u = h\left( u\right) \text{ in }{\mathbb{R}}^{N}, \\ u \in {H}^{1}\left( {\mathbb{R}}^{N}\right), \end{array}\right. $$ where $N \geq 3,\kappa &gt; 0$ is a parameter, and $h$ satisfies Berestycki-Lions condition. By using a critical point theory on a topological manifold, we obtain the existence of a ground state for $N \geq 3$, a nonradial ground state for $N \geq 4$, and infinitely many nonradial solutions for $N = 4$ or $N \geq 6$. Our results generalize several classical works into quasilinear equations.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously establish the formal asymptotics of Neu for Gross-Pitaevskii vortex dynamics in the plane. Given any integer $n\geq2$, we construct a family of $n$-vortex solutions with vortices of degree $\pm1$, and describe precisely the solution profile and associated vortex dynamics on an arbitrarily large, finite time interval. We compute an asymptotic expansion of the vortex positions in terms of the vortex core size $\epsilon&gt;0$, and show that the dynamics is governed at leading order as $\epsilon\to0$ by the classical Helmholtz-Kirchhoff system. Moreover, we show that the first correction to the leading order dynamics is determined by the solution of a linear wave equation, justifying a formal expansion found by Ovchinnikov and Sigal.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the Allen-Cahn equation with dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn-Hilliard type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems for partial differential equations coupled with dynamic boundary conditions can be viewed as a type of transmission problem between the bulk and its boundary. For the heat equation and the Allen-Cahn equation, various forms of such problems with dynamic boundary conditions are studied in this paper. In the case of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in the bulk, several models have been proposed in which the boundary equations and conditions differ. Recently, the vanishing surface diffusion limit has been investigated in more than one of these models. In such settings, the resulting dynamic boundary equation typically takes the form of a forward-backward parabolic equation. In this paper, we focus on a different model, in which the Allen-Cahn equation governs the bulk dynamics, while the boundary condition is of Cahn-Hilliard type. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the system, including the well-posedness of the limiting problems and corresponding error estimates for the differences between solutions. These aspects are discussed for three types of limiting systems.</description>

      <title>Existence results for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model with variable exponent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model where the diffusion coefficient involves a state-dependent variable exponent function $p(\cdot)$. This new theoretically flexible framework generalizes the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. The existence, uniqueness, higher moment and martingale properties of solutions are analyzed. The validity and efficiency of the model is illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and Kr\"oger inequality and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide quantitative improvements to the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and the Kr\"oger inequality, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

      <title>Moment Estimate and Variational Approach for Learning Generalized Diffusion with Non-gradient Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>
