      <title>Does GenAI Rewrite How We Write? An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.
  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Court-Ready? Evaluating Frontier Models on Indian Legal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are entering legal workflows, yet we lack a jurisdiction-specific framework to assess their baseline competence therein. We use India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy. Our multi-year benchmark assembles objective screens from top national and state exams and evaluates open and frontier LLMs under real-world exam conditions. To probe beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded, India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks, cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical, accountable judgment.</description>

      <title>Interpretability Framework for LLMs in Undergraduate Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in education, yet their correctness alone does not capture the quality, reliability, or pedagogical validity of their problem-solving behavior, especially in mathematics, where multistep logic, symbolic reasoning, and conceptual clarity are critical. Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative, and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments.</description>

      <title>Attracting Commercial Artificial Intelligence Firms to Support National Security through Collaborative Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike other military technologies driven by national security needs and developed with federal funding, AI is predominantly funded and advanced by commercial industry for civilian applications. However, there is a lack of understanding of the reasons commercial AI firms decide to work with the DoD or choose to abstain from the defence market. This thesis argues that the contract law and procurement framework are among the most significant obstacles. This research indicates that the commercial AI industry actually views the DoD as an attractive customer. However, this attraction is despite the obstacles presented by traditional contract law and procurement practices used to solicit and award contracts. Drawing on social exchange theory, this thesis introduces a theoretical framework, optimal buyer theory, to understand the factors that influence a commercial decision to engage with the DoD. Interviews from a sample of the participants explain why the AI industry holds such perceptions, opinions, and preferences about contracts generally and the DoD, specifically, in its role as a customer. This thesis concludes that commercial AI firms are attracted to contracts that are consistent with their business and technology considerations. Additionally, it develops best practices for leveraging existing contract law, primarily other transaction authority, to align contracting practices with commercial preferences and the machine learning development and deployment lifecycle.</description>

      <title>The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education in Spain: Descriptive Analysis and International Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators.</description>

      <title>Trust in foundation models and GenAI: A geographic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained machine learning models have reshaped our understanding of artificial intelligence across numerous domains, including our own field of geography. As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI.</description>

      <title>Integrating Generative AI into LMS: Reshaping Learning and Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Education in the era of generative AI faces a pivotal transformation. As AI systems reshape professional practices-from software development to creative design-educators must reconsider how to prepare students for a future where humans and machines co-construct knowledge. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude automate tasks and personalize learning, their educational potential depends on how meaningfully they are integrated into learning environments. This paper argues that Learning Management Systems (LMSs), as the core of educational practice, must evolve from static content repositories into dynamic ecosystems that cultivate higher-order thinking and meaningful human-AI interaction. We propose two guiding principles for integrating generative AI into LMSs. First, From Content Delivery to Fostering Higher-Order Thinking, emphasizing AI's role in supporting inquiry, collaboration, and reflective knowledge building. Second, Toward Meaningful Interaction with AI, highlighting the design of learning environments that nurture critical, intentional, and socially mediated engagement with AI. Drawing on a case study of CheckIT Learning, we illustrate how these principles can translate into practice. We conclude with the need for Edtech partnerships in an AI-powered world, underscoring that responsible AI integration in education requires sustained collaboration among researchers, educators, and technologists to ensure ethical, pedagogically grounded, and cognitively informed innovation.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-Primal Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Prompt-to-Primal (P2P) Teaching, an AI-integrated instructional approach that links prompt-driven exploration with first-principles reasoning, guided and moderated by the instructor within the classroom setting. In P2P teaching, student-generated AI prompts serve as entry points for inquiry and initial discussions in class, while the instructor guides learners to validate, challenge, and reconstruct AI responses through fundamental physical and mathematical laws. The approach encourages self-reflective development, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and conceptual foundational knowledge of the core engineering principles. A large language model (LLM) can be a highly effective tool for those who already possess foundational knowledge of a subject; however, it may also mislead students who lack sufficient background in the subject matter. Results from two student cohorts across different semesters suggest the pedagogical effectiveness of the P2P teaching framework in enhancing both AI literacy and engineering reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Cost-Benefit of Interdisciplinarity in AI for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has been introduced as a way to improve access to mental health support. However, most AI mental health chatbots rely on a limited range of disciplinary input, and fail to integrate expertise across the chatbot's lifecycle. This paper examines the cost-benefit trade-off of interdisciplinary collaboration in AI mental health chatbots. We argue that involving experts from technology, healthcare, ethics, and law across key lifecycle phases is essential to ensure value-alignment and compliance with the high-risk requirements of the AI Act. We also highlight practical recommendations and existing frameworks to help balance the challenges and benefits of interdisciplinarity in mental health chatbots.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models and Evaluating Student Outcomes in an Introductory Computer Science Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have broad implications for education in general, impacting the foundations of what we teach and how we assess. This is especially true in computing, where LLMs tuned for coding have demonstrated shockingly good performance on the types of assignments historically used in introductory CS (CS1) courses. As a result, CS1 courses will need to change what skills are taught and how they are assessed. Computing education researchers have begun to study student use of LLMs, but there remains much to be understood about the ways that these tools affect student outcomes. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a new CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that integrates the use of LLMs as a learning tool for students. We describe the design principles used to create our new CS1-LLM course, our new course objectives, and evaluation of student outcomes and perceptions throughout the course as measured by assessment scores and surveys. Our findings suggest that 1) student exam performance outcomes, including differences among demographic groups, are largely similar to historical outcomes for courses without integration of LLM tools, 2) large, open-ended projects may be particularly valuable in an LLM context, and 3) students predominantly found the LLM tools helpful, although some had concerns regarding over-reliance on the tools.</description>

      <title>MoveOD: Synthesizing Origin-Destination Commute Distribution from U.S. Census Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution origin-destination (OD) tables are essential for a wide spectrum of transportation applications, from modeling traffic and signal timing optimization to congestion pricing and vehicle routing. However, outside a handful of data rich cities, such data is rarely available. We introduce MOVEOD, an open-source pipeline that synthesizes public data into commuter OD flows with fine-grained spatial and temporal departure times for any county in the United States. MOVEOD combines five open data sources: American Community Survey (ACS) departure time and travel time distributions, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES) residence-to-workplace flows, county geometries, road network information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and building footprints from OSM and Microsoft, into a single OD dataset. We use a constrained sampling and integer-programming method to reconcile the OD dataset with data from ACS and LODES. Our approach involves: (1) matching commuter totals per origin zone, (2) aligning workplace destinations with employment distributions, and (3) calibrating travel durations to ACS-reported commute times. This ensures the OD data accurately reflects commuting patterns. We demonstrate the framework on Hamilton County, Tennessee, where we generate roughly 150,000 synthetic trips in minutes, which we feed into a benchmark suite of classical and learning-based vehicle-routing algorithms. The MOVEOD pipeline is an end-to-end automated system, enabling users to easily apply it across the United States by giving only a county and a year; and it can be adapted to other countries with comparable census datasets. The source code and a lightweight browser interface are publicly available.</description>

      <title>TACLA: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Tool for Transactional Analysis Training in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nuanced human social dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving psychological depth and consistent persona behavior crucial for high-fidelity training tools. This paper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a novel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA integrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as an orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each with its own pattern memory. An Orchestrator Agent prioritizes ego state activation based on contextual triggers and an agent's life script, ensuring psychologically authentic responses. Validated in an educational scenario, TACLA demonstrates realistic ego state shifts in Student Agents, effectively modeling conflict de-escalation and escalation based on different teacher intervention strategies. Evaluation shows high conversational credibility and confirms TACLA's capacity to create dynamic, psychologically-grounded social simulations, advancing the development of effective AI tools for education and beyond.</description>

      <title>Studying the Effects of Robot Intervention on School Shooters in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.</description>

      <title>BadScientist: Can a Research Agent Write Convincing but Unsound Papers that Fool LLM Reviewers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of LLM-powered research assistants and AI-based peer review systems creates a critical vulnerability: fully automated publication loops where AI-generated research is evaluated by AI reviewers without human oversight. We investigate this through \textbf{BadScientist}, a framework that evaluates whether fabrication-oriented paper generation agents can deceive multi-model LLM review systems. Our generator employs presentation-manipulation strategies requiring no real experiments. We develop a rigorous evaluation framework with formal error guarantees (concentration bounds and calibration analysis), calibrated on real data. Our results reveal systematic vulnerabilities: fabricated papers achieve acceptance rates up to . Critically, we identify \textit{concern-acceptance conflict} -- reviewers frequently flag integrity issues yet assign acceptance-level scores. Our mitigation strategies show only marginal improvements, with detection accuracy barely exceeding random chance. Despite provably sound aggregation mathematics, integrity checking systematically fails, exposing fundamental limitations in current AI-driven review systems and underscoring the urgent need for defense-in-depth safeguards in scientific publishing.</description>

      <title>Annotating the Chain-of-Thought: A Behavior-Labeled Dataset for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for improving safety oversight on reasoning.

      <title>Fostering the Ecosystem of AI for Social Impact Requires Expanding and Strengthening Evaluation Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact of deployed systems.</description>

      <title>Food4All: A Multi-Agent Framework for Real-time Free Food Discovery with Integrated Nutritional Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries, access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases, community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.</description>

      <title>RAISE: A Unified Framework for Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/raise-framework/raise.</description>

      <title>Facts are Harder Than Opinions -- A Multilingual, Comparative Analysis of LLM-Based Fact-Checking Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates scalable, automated fact-checking solutions. Yet, current benchmarks often overlook multilingual and topical diversity. This paper introduces a novel, dynamically extensible data set that includes 61,514 claims in multiple languages and topics, extending existing datasets up to 2024. Through a comprehensive evaluation of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between different languages and topics. While overall GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, it declines to classify 43% of claims. Across all models, factual-sounding claims are misclassified more often than opinions, revealing a key vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for caution and highlight challenges in deploying LLM-based fact-checking systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Combining Cost-Constrained Runtime Monitors for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In this paper, we study how to efficiently combine multiple runtime monitors into a single monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the best protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive settings.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Framework for Evaluating the Ethics and Trustworthiness of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies.</description>

      <title>The Narcissus Hypothesis: Descending to the Rung of Illusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Computation of DiRe Committees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a committee election consisting of (i) a set of candidates who are divided into arbitrary groups each of size ${at~most}$ two and a diversity constraint that stipulates the selection of ${at~least}$ one candidate from each group and (ii) a set of voters who are divided into arbitrary populations each approving ${at~most}$ two candidates and a representation constraint that stipulates the selection of ${at~least}$ one candidate from each population who has a non-null set of approved candidates.
  The DiRe (Diverse + Representative) committee feasibility problem (a.k.a. the minimum vertex cover problem on unweighted undirected graphs) concerns the determination of the smallest size committee that satisfies the given constraints. Here, for this problem, we propose an algorithm that is an amalgamation of maximum matching, breadth-first search, maximal matching, and local minimization. We prove the algorithm terminates in polynomial-time. We conjecture the algorithm is an unconditional deterministic polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning Fairer Representations with FairVIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, particularly in deep learning models, is a critical challenge due to nuanced definitions of fairness, dataset-specific biases, and the inherent trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach that enhances fairness in neural networks by integrating variance, invariance, and covariance terms into the loss function during training. Unlike methods that rely on predefined fairness criteria, FairVIC abstracts fairness concepts to minimise dependency on protected characteristics. We evaluate FairVIC against comparable bias mitigation techniques on benchmark datasets, considering both group and individual fairness, and conduct an ablation study on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. FairVIC demonstrates significant improvements ($\approx70\%$) in fairness across all tested metrics without compromising accuracy, thus offering a robust, generalisable solution for fair deep learning across diverse tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>DarkGram: A Large-Scale Analysis of Cybercriminal Activity Channels on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale analysis of 339 cybercriminal activity channels (CACs). Followed by over 23.8 million users, these channels share a wide array of malicious and unethical content with their subscribers, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, social media manipulation tools, and blackhat hacking resources such as malware, exploit kits, and social engineering scams. To evaluate these channels, we developed DarkGram, a BERT-based framework that automatically identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%. Using DarkGram, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts shared on these channels between February and May 2024, revealing key characteristics of the content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ strategies such as promotions and giveaways to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. Interestingly, these channels sometimes pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of the links shared in these channels contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Analyzing how subscribers consume and positively react to the shared content paints a dangerous picture of the perpetuation of cybercriminal content at scale. We also found that the CACs can evade scrutiny or platform takedowns by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we utilized DarkGram to detect emerging channels and reported malicious content to Telegram and affected organizations. This resulted in the takedown of 196 channels over three months. Our findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat the growing threats posed by these channels. To aid this effort, we open-source our dataset and the DarkGram framework.</description>

      <title>LLM Safety Alignment is Divergence Estimation in Disguise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less preferred) distributions. This perspective explains the emergence of separation in the latent space between safe and harmful prompts after alignment. As an application of our general divergence framework, we propose KLDO, a novel KL divergence-based alignment method, and empirically validate its effectiveness. We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard preference-based datasets, leads to stronger separation and improved safety alignment. Finally, to quantify the separation effect, we propose a distance-based metric in the prompt representation space, which also acts as a statistically significant indicator for model safety.</description>

      <title>The Shift Towards Preprints in AI Policy Research: A Comparative Study of Preprint Trends in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern legislative frameworks, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often involve complex webs of agencies, mandates, and interdependencies. Government issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static, dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout, an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and regulatory frameworks. Our approach enables stakeholders - policymakers, analysts, and the public - to navigate and understand the complexity inherent in modern law.</description>

      <title>"She's Like a Person but Better": Characterizing Companion-Assistant Dynamics in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 204) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots "real" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.</description>

      <title>SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate Human Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17516</link>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Interactions: Cognitive, Behavioral, and Emotional Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As stories of human-AI interactions continue to be highlighted in the news and research platforms, the challenges are becoming more pronounced, including potential risks of overreliance, cognitive offloading, social and emotional manipulation, and the nuanced degradation of human agency and judgment. This paper surveys recent research on these issues through the lens of the psychological triad: cognition, behavior, and emotion. Observations seem to suggest that while AI can substantially enhance memory, creativity, and engagement, it also introduces risks such as diminished critical thinking, skill erosion, and increased anxiety. Emotional outcomes are similarly mixed, with AI systems showing promise for support and stress reduction, but raising concerns about dependency, inappropriate attachments, and ethical oversight. This paper aims to underscore the need for responsible and context-aware AI design, highlighting gaps for longitudinal research and grounded evaluation frameworks to balance benefits with emerging human-centric risks.</description>
