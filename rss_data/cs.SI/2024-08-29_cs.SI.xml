      <title>Intertwined Biases Across Social Media Spheres: Unpacking Correlations in Media Bias Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Media bias significantly shapes public perception by reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating societal divisions. Prior research has often focused on isolated media bias dimensions such as \textit{political bias} or \textit{racial bias}, neglecting the complex interrelationships among various bias dimensions across different topic domains. Moreover, we observe that models trained on existing media bias benchmarks fail to generalize effectively on recent social media posts, particularly in certain bias identification tasks. This shortfall primarily arises because these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the rapidly evolving nature of social media content, which is characterized by shifting user behaviors and emerging trends. In response to these limitations, our research introduces a novel dataset collected from YouTube and Reddit over the past five years. Our dataset includes automated annotations for YouTube content across a broad spectrum of bias dimensions, such as gender, racial, and political biases, as well as hate speech, among others. It spans diverse domains including politics, sports, healthcare, education, and entertainment, reflecting the complex interplay of biases across different societal sectors. Through comprehensive statistical analysis, we identify significant differences in bias expression patterns and intra-domain bias correlations across these domains. By utilizing our understanding of the correlations among various bias dimensions, we lay the groundwork for creating advanced systems capable of detecting multiple biases simultaneously. Overall, our dataset advances the field of media bias identification, contributing to the development of tools that promote fairer media consumption. The comprehensive awareness of existing media bias fosters more ethical journalism, promotes cultural sensitivity, and supports a more informed and equitable public discourse.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Common Ground: Analyzing the quality and usage of International Auxiliary Languages in Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) are constructed languages designed to facilitate communication among speakers of different native languages while fostering equality, efficiency, and cross-cultural understanding. This study focuses on analyzing the editions of IALs on Wikipedia, including Simple English, Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Volapuk, Interlingue, and Novial. We compare them with three natural languages: English, Spanish, and Catalan. Our aim is to establish a basis for the use of IALs in Wikipedia as well as showcase a new methodology for categorizing wikis. We found in total there are 1.3 million articles written in these languages and they gather 15.6 million monthly views. Although this is not a negligible amount of content, in comparison with large natural language projects there is still a big room for improvement. We concluded that IAL editions on Wikipedia are similar to other projects, behaving proportionally to their communities' size. Therefore, the key to their growth is augmenting the amount and quality of the content offered in these languages. To that end, we offer a set of statistics to understand and improve these projects, and we developed a webpage that displays our findings to foster knowledge sharing and facilitate the expansion of the IAL communities.</description>

      <title>Antivax and off-label medication communities on brazilian Telegram: between esotericism as a gateway and the monetization of false miraculous cures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories, particularly those focused on anti-vaccine narratives and the promotion of off-label medications such as MMS and CDS, have proliferated on Telegram, including in Brazil, finding fertile ground among communities that share esoteric beliefs and distrust towards scientific institutions. In this context, this study seeks to answer how Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram are characterized and articulated concerning anti-vaccine themes and off-label medications? It is important to highlight that this study is part of a series of seven studies aimed at understanding and characterizing Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of seven studies is openly and originally available on the arXiv of Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across all studies, changing only the thematic object of analysis and providing replicable research, including proprietary and original codes developed, contributing to the culture of free and open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, it was observed: Themes such as the New World Order and Apocalypse and Survivalism act as significant gateways to anti-vaccine narratives, connecting them to theories of global control; Globalism and New World Order stand out as the main communities receiving invitations from anti-vaccine communities; Occultism and Esotericism emerge as the largest sources of invitations to off-label medication communities, creating a strong connection between esoteric beliefs and the promotion of non-scientific treatments; Anti-vaccine narratives experienced a 290% increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidencing a growing interconnectedness with other conspiracy theories; The overlap of themes between anti-vaccine and other conspiracy theories creates an interdependent disinformation network, where different narratives mutually reinforce each other.</description>

      <title>Climate change denial and anti-science communities on brazilian Telegram: climate disinformation as a gateway to broader conspiracy networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories related to climate change denial and anti-science have found fertile ground on Telegram, particularly among Brazilian communities that distrust scientific institutions and oppose global environmental policies. This study seeks to answer the research question: how are Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on climate change and anti-science themes characterized and articulated on Telegram? It is worth noting that this study is part of a series of seven studies aimed at understanding and characterizing Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of studies is openly and originally available on arXiv from Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across all seven studies, changing only the thematic focus of analysis, and providing replicable investigation methods, including custom-developed and proprietary codes, contributing to the culture of open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, the following observations were made: Climate change denial and anti-science communities interact synergistically, creating a complex network that mutually reinforces disinformation narratives; Apocalyptic themes, such as Apocalypse and Survivalism, act as gateways to climate denial, with 5,057 links directed to these communities; Anti-science communities function as gatekeepers, distributing links evenly to theories such as the New World Order and Globalism, among others; During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-science discussions experienced a significant peak, driven by vaccine disinformation; The intersection between anti-science narratives and esoteric beliefs reinforces the idea of a supposed alternative truth that challenges science; Since 2022, discussions on climate change have evolved to align with global domination theories; Additionally, the UN's 2030 Agenda is portrayed as part of a global conspiracy.</description>

      <title>Inferring Individual Direct Causal Effects Under Heterogeneous Peer Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inference in networks should account for interference, which occurs when a unit's outcome is influenced by treatments or outcomes of peers. Heterogeneous peer influence (HPI) occurs when a unit's outcome is influenced differently by different peers based on their attributes and relationships, or when each unit has a different susceptibility to peer influence. Existing solutions to estimating direct causal effects under interference consider either homogeneous influence from peers or specific heterogeneous influence mechanisms (e.g., based on local neighborhood structure). This paper presents a methodology for estimating individual direct causal effects in the presence of HPI where the mechanism of influence is not known a priori. We propose a structural causal model for networks that can capture different possible assumptions about network structure, interference conditions, and causal dependence and enables reasoning about identifiability in the presence of HPI. We find potential heterogeneous contexts using the causal model and propose a novel graph neural network-based estimator to estimate individual direct causal effects. We show that state-of-the-art methods for individual direct effect estimation produce biased results in the presence of HPI, and that our proposed estimator is robust.</description>

      <title>BotSCL: Heterophily-aware Social Bot Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting ever-evolving social bots has become increasingly challenging. Advanced bots tend to interact more with humans as a camouflage to evade detection. While graph-based detection methods can exploit various relations in social networks to model node behaviors, the aggregated information from neighbors largely ignore the inherent heterophily, i.e., the connections between different classes of accounts. Message passing mechanism on heterophilic edges can lead to feature mixture between bots and normal users, resulting in more false negatives. In this paper, we present BotSCL, a heterophily-aware contrastive learning framework that can adaptively differentiate neighbor representations of heterophilic relations while assimilating the representations of homophilic neighbors. Specifically, we employ two graph augmentation methods to generate different graph views and design a channel-wise and attention-free encoder to overcome the limitation of neighbor information summing. Supervised contrastive learning is used to guide the encoder to aggregate class-specific information. Extensive experiments on two social bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotSCL outperforms baseline approaches including the state-of-the-art bot detection approaches, partially heterophilic GNNs and self-supervised contrast learning methods.</description>
