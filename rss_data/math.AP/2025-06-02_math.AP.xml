      <title>Shape derivative approach to fractional overdetermined problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use shape derivative approach to prove that balls are the only convex and $C^{1,1}$ regular domains in which the fractional overdetermined problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} \Ds u&amp;= \lambda_{s, p} u^{p-1}\quad\text{in}\quad\Om \\ u &amp;= 0\quad \text{in}\quad\R^N\setminus \Om\\ u/d^s&amp;=C_0\quad\text{on\;\; $\partial\O$} \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} admits a nontrivial solution for $p\in [1, 2]$ and where $\lambda_{s, p}= \lambda_{s, p}(\O)$ is the best constant in the family of Subcritical Sobolev inequalities. In the cases $p=1$ and $p=2$, we recover the classical symmetry results of Serrin, corresponding to the torsion problem and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue problem, respectively (see \cite{FS-15}). We note that for $p\in (1,2)$, the above problem lies outside the framework of \cite{FS-15}, and the methods developed therein do not apply. Our approach extends to the fractional setting a method initially developed by A. Henrot and T. Chatelain in \cite{CH-99}, and relies on the use of domain derivatives combined with the continuous Steiner symmetrization introduced by Brock in \cite{Brock-00}.</description>

      <title>A large scaling property of level sets for degenerate $p$-Laplacian equations with logarithmic BMO matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we deal with generalized regularity properties for solutions to $p$-Laplace equations with degenerate matrix weights. It has already been observed in previous interesting works [A. Kh. Balci, L. Diening, R. Giova, A. Passarelli di Napoli, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 54(2022), 2373-2412] and [A. Kh. Balci, S.-S. Byun, L. Diening, H.-S. Lee, J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 177(2023), 484-530] that gaining Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for nonlinear equations with degenerate weights under the so-called $\log$-$\mathrm{BMO}$ condition and minimal regularity assumption on the boundary. In this paper, we also follow this direction and extend general gradient estimates for level sets of the gradient of solutions up to more subtle function spaces. In particular, we construct a covering of the super-level sets of the spatial gradient $|\nabla u|$ with respect to a large scaling parameter via fractional maximal operators.</description>

      <title>The vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation with potentials of high-dimensional double-wells under Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation with potentials of high-dimensional double-wells under Robin boundary conditions. We establish local-in-time convergence of solutions to mean curvature flow with a fixed contact angle $0&lt;\alpha\leq 90^\circ$, for a broad class of boundary energy densities and well-prepared initial data. The limiting sharp-interface system is derived, comprising harmonic heat flows in the bulk and minimal pair conditions at phase boundaries. The analysis combines the relative entropy method with gradient flow calibrations and weak convergence techniques. These results extend prior works on the analysis of the vector-valued case without boundary effects (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 78:1199-1247, 2025) and the scalar-valued case with boundary contact energy (Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ., 61:201, 2022).</description>

      <title>Concentrating solutions of the fractional $(p,q)$-Choquard equation with exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the following fractional $(p,q)$-Choquard equation with exponential growth of the form: $$\varepsilon^{ps}(-\Delta)_{p}^{s}u+\varepsilon^{qs}(-\Delta)_q^su+ Z(x)(|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{q-2}u)=\varepsilon^{\mu-N}[|x|^{-\mu}*F(u)]f(u) \ \ \mbox{in} \ \ \mathbb{R}^N,$$ where $s\in (0,1),$ $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter, $2\leq p=\frac{N}{s}&lt;q,$ and $0&lt;\mu&lt;N.$ The nonlinear function $f$ has an exponential growth at infinity and the continuous potential function $Z$ satisfies suitable natural conditions. With the help of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category theory and variational methods, the multiplicity and concentration of positive solutions are obtained for $\varepsilon&gt;0$ small enough. In a certain sense, we generalize some previously known results.</description>

      <title>Critical scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on waveguide manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on waveguide manifolds. Our work is primarily inspired by the recent paper of Kwak and Kwon \cite{KwakKwon} that established the local well-posedness of the periodic NLS with possibly non-algebraic nonlinearity. While we adopt a framework similar to \cite{KwakKwon} for our problem, two main obstacles prevent its direct adaptation to the waveguide setting. First, the classical Strichartz estimates for NLS in critical product spaces, introduced by Hani and Pausader, possess limited endpoints and are thus inapplicable to high-dimensional waveguides. Second, the crucial fractional arguments used in \cite{KwakKwon} rely on a well-known fractional derivative formula due to Strichartz, which admits only a Hilbert space-valued extension and is therefore incompatible with our model setting.
  To overcome these difficulties, we develop an anisotropic generalization of the framework in \cite{KwakKwon} using the anisotropic Strichartz estimates established by Tzvetkov and Visciglia, which allow for nearly unlimited endpoints. We also resolve several new challenges arising from the vector-valued and anisotropic nature of the model by employing novel interpolation techniques within Besov spaces. As a further novelty, we provide a new proof of the main result based on classical fixed point arguments, differing from the approximation methods used in \cite{KwakKwon}. Consequently, we settle the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the NLS with arbitrary mass-supercritical nonlinearity on waveguide manifolds.</description>

      <title>Lie point symmetries of the biharmonic heat equation on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses Lie symmetry analysis to investigate the biharmonic heat equation on a generalized surface of revolution. We classify the Lie point symmetries associated with this equation, allowing for the identification of surfaces and the corresponding infinitesimal generators. In a significant move, we demonstrate that the biharmonic heat equation on a surface of revolution admits the same Lie symmetries as the harmonic heat equation on the same surface, highlighting a profound structural relationship between the two equations. Utilizing these symmetry groups, we derive similarity reductions that yield invariant forms of the equation and facilitate the construction of exact solutions. Finally, we provide certain examples illustrating precise solutions on the related surfaces with positive, negative, and zero Gaussian curvatures, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. This work contributes to the understanding of biharmonic heat equations on symmetric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined elliptic problems on model Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigidity theorem for annular sector-like domains in the setting of overdetermined elliptic problems on model Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, if such a domain admits a solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation satisfying both constant Dirichlet and constant Neumann boundary conditions, then the domain must be a spherical sector, and the solution must be radially symmetric. This result underscores the strong geometric constraints imposed by overdetermined boundary conditions, extending classical rigidity phenomena to this more general framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the s-parabolic Lipschitz caloric capacity of corner-like $s$-parabolic Cantor sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for $1/2&lt;s\leq 1$. Despite the spatial gradient of the s-heat kernel lacking temporal anti-symmetry, we obtain analogous results to those known for analytic and Riesz capacities.</description>

      <title>Intermittent singular solutions of the stationary 2D Navier-Stokes equations in sharp Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary Navier-Stokes equations on the two dimensional torus which lie in $\bigcap_{\epsilon \in (0,1)} L^{2-\epsilon}(\mathbb{T}^2) \cap \dot H^{-\epsilon}(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Due to the fact that our solutions are not square integrable, we must redefine the notion of solution. Our result gives a sharp extension of recent work of Lemari\'e-Rieusset, who proved a similar result in the space $\dot{H}^{-1} \cap {BMO}^{-1}$. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of parabolic problems for non-local convolution type operators under non-diffusive scaling of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homogenization problem for non-autonomous parabolic equations of the form $\partial_t u=L(t)u$ with an integral convolution type operator $L(t)$ that has a non-symmetric jump kernel which is periodic in spatial variables and in time. It is assumed that the space-time scaling of the environment is not diffusive. We show that asymptotically the spatial and temporal evolutions of the solutions are getting decoupled, and the homogenization result holds in a moving frame.</description>

      <title>Regularity and pointwise convergence for dispersive equations with asymptotically concave phase on Damek-Ricci spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Carleson's problem on Damek-Ricci spaces $S$ for dispersive equations: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +\Psi(\sqrt{-\mathcal{L}} )u=0\:,\: (x,t) \in S \times \mathbb{R} \:, \\ u(0,\cdot)=f\:,\: \text{ on } S \:,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{L}= \Delta$, the Laplace-Beltrami operator or $\tilde{\Delta}$, the shifted Laplace-Beltrami operator, so that the corresponding phase function $\psi$ satisfies for some $a \in (0,1)$, the large frequency asymptotic: \begin{equation*} \psi(\lambda)=\lambda^a + \mathcal{O}(1)\:,\:\: \lambda \gg 1\:. \end{equation*} For almost everywhere pointwise convergence of the solution $u$ to its radial initial data $f$, we obtain the almost sharp regularity threshold $\beta&gt;a/4$. This result is new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and in the special case of the fractional Schr\"odinger equations, generalizes classical Euclidean results of Walther.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of Mean Field Games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Poiseuille laminar flow in a tube for the full Ericksen-Leslie system. It is a parabolic-hyperbolic coupled system which may develop singularity in finite time. We will prove the global existence of energy weak solution, and the partial regularity of solution to system. We first construct global weak finite energy solutions by the Ginzburg- Landau approximation and the fixed-point arguments. Then we obtain the enhanced regularity of solution. Different from the solution in one space dimension, the finite energy solution of Poiseuille laminar flow in a tube may still form a discontinuity at the origin. We show that at the first possible blowup time, there are blowup sequences which converge to a non-constant time-independent (axisymmetric) harmonic map.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the inverse scattering problem for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with magnetic potentials. Specifically, we investigate whether the scattering operator associated with the nonlinear Schrodinger equation can uniquely determine the magnetic potential. Our main goal is to establish the uniqueness result for the magnetic potential based on the scattering data obtained from the scattering operator.</description>

      <title>General monotone formula for homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation in the exterior domain and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an overdetermined problem for the $k$-Hessian equation ($1\leq k&lt;\frac n2$) in the exterior domain and prove the corresponding ball characterizations. Since that Weinberger type approach seems to fail to solve the problem, we give a new perspective to solve exterior overdetermined problem by combining two integral identities and geometric inequalities. In particular, when $k=1$, we give an alternative proof for Brandolini-Nitsch-Salani's results \cite{BNS}. Meanwhile, we establish general monotone formulas to derive geometric inequalities related to $k$-admissible solution $u$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is smooth, $k$-convex and star-shaped domain, which constructed by Ma-Zhang\cite{MZ} and Xiao\cite{xiao}.</description>

      <title>From Initial Data to Boundary Layers: Neural Networks for Nonlinear Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the approximation of entropy solutions to initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear strictly hyperbolic conservation laws using neural networks. A general and systematic framework is introduced for the design of efficient and reliable learning algorithms, combining fast convergence during training with accurate predictions. The methodology is assessed through a series of one-dimensional scalar test cases, highlighting its potential applicability to more complex industrial scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of multiple almost circular concentrated vortices in a fluid evolving according to the two-dimensional Euler equations. We show that, for general configurations, they must remain concentrated on time-scales much longer than previously known as long as they remain separated. We further prove a new stability estimate for the logarithmic interaction energy as part of the proof.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotics of solution to defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a class of step initial data. A rigorous asymptotic analysis is conducted on the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem by applying Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this process, the construction of the $g$-function is generalized and the method of genus reduction to Riemann-theta function is proposed via conformal transformation and symmetries. It is revealed that for sufficiently large time, the solution manifests a tripartite spatiotemporal structure, i.e., in the left plane-wave region, the solution decays to a modulated plane wave with oscillatory correction; in the central dispersive shock wave region, the solution is governed by a modulated elliptic wave; in the right plane-wave region, the solution converges exponentially to a constant. The results from the long-time asymptotic analysis have been shown to match remarkably well with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations with the zero sound speed in scaling critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-value problem in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d \ge 3)$ for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations under the zero sound speed case (namely, $P'(\rho_*)=0$, where $P=P(\rho)$ stands for the pressure). The system is well-known as the Diffuse Interface model describing the motion of a vaper-liquid mixture in a compressible viscous fluid. The purposes of this paper are to obtain the global-in-time solution around the constant equilibrium states $(\rho_*,0)$ $(\rho_*&gt;0)$ satisfying the estimate on the analyticity as established by Foias-Temam (1989), and investigate the $L^p$-$L^1$ type time-decay estimates in scaling critical settings based on Fourier-Herz spaces. In addition, we also derive the first order asymptotic formula with higher derivatives for solutions as the application of the analyticity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study superlinear systems that give rise to free boundaries. Such systems appear for example from the minimization of the energy functional $$ \int_{\Omega}\left(|\nabla\mathbf{u}|^2+\frac2p|\mathbf{u}|^p\right),\quad 0&lt;p&lt;1, $$ but solutions can be also understood in an ad hoc viscosity way. First, we prove the optimal regularity of minimizers using a variational approach. Then, we apply a linearization technique to establish the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of the ``flat'' part of the free boundary via a viscosity method. Finally, for minimizing free boundaries, we extend this result to analyticity.ad hoc viscosity way.</description>

      <title>Solutions with large number of peaks for a slightly supercritical nonlinear equation in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of solutions to the semilinear equation with a slightly supercritical exponent in dimension three,
  \begin{align*}
  -\Delta u=K(x) u^{5+\mu},\quad u&gt;0 ~\text{in}~ \mathbf{B}, \quad u=0 ~\text{on}~ \partial \mathbf{B},
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu &gt;0$, $\mathbf{B}$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $K(x)$ is a nonnegative radial function under suitable condition on $K$. We prove the existence of positive multi-peak solutions for $\mu&gt;0$ small enough. All peaks of our solutions approach the boundary $\partial\mathbf{B}$ as $\mu\rightarrow 0$. Moreover, the number of peaks varies with the parameter $\mu$ as $\mu$ goes to $0^+$.
  Note that the case $n\geq 4$ was considered by Liu and Peng \cite{LiuPeng2016}.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves for a two-phase Stefan problem with radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of traveling wave solutions for a free-boundary problem modeling the phase transition of a material where the heat is transported by both conduction and radiation. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional two-phase Stefan problem with an additional non-local non-linear integral term describing the situation in which the heat is transferred in the solid phase also by radiation, while the liquid phase is completely transparent, not interacting with radiation. We will prove that there are traveling wave solutions for the considered model, differently from the case of the classical Stefan problem in which only self-similar solutions with the parabolic scale $ x\sim \sqrt{t} $ exist. In particular we will show that there exist traveling waves for which the solid expands. The properties of these solutions will be studied using maximum-principle methods, blow-up limits and Liouville-type Theorems for non-linear integral-differential equations.</description>

      <title>Modified wave operators for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one space dimension with large scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct modified wave operators for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in one space dimension without size restriction on scattering data. In the proof, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the linearization of the NLS around a prescribed asymptotic profile. For the linearized equation which is a system of Schr\"odinger equations with non-symmetric, time-dependent long-range potentials, we show a modified energy identity, as well as an associated energy estimate, which allow us to apply a simple energy method to construct the modified wave operators. As a byproduct, we also obtain in the focusing case an improved explicit upper bound for the size of scattering data to ensure the existence of modified wave operators. Our argument relies neither on the complete integrability nor on the smoothness of nonlinearity, and also works for short-range perturbations of the cubic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Minimax Rates for the Estimation of Eigenpairs of Weighted Laplace-Beltrami Operators on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating eigenpairs of elliptic differential operators from samples of a distribution $\rho$ supported on a manifold $M$. The operators discussed in the paper are relevant in unsupervised learning and in particular are obtained by taking suitable scaling limits of widely used graph Laplacians over data clouds. We study the minimax risk for this eigenpair estimation problem and explore the rates of approximation that can be achieved by commonly used graph Laplacians built from random data. More concretely, assuming that $\rho$ belongs to a certain family of distributions with controlled second derivatives, and assuming that the $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ where $\rho$ is supported has bounded geometry, we prove that the statistical minimax rate for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the $H^1(M)$-sense is $n^{-2/(d+4)}$, a rate that matches the minimax rate for a closely related density estimation problem. We then revisit the literature studying Laplacians over proximity graphs in the large data limit and prove that, under slightly stronger regularity assumptions on the data generating model, eigenpairs of graph Laplacians induce manifold agnostic estimators with an error of approximation that, up to logarithmic corrections, matches our lower bounds. Our analysis allows us to expand the existing literature on graph-based learning in at least two significant ways: 1) we consider stronger norms to measure the error of approximation than the ones that had been analyzed in the past; 2) our rates of convergence are uniform over a family of smooth distributions and do not just apply to densities with special symmetries, and, as a consequence of our lower bounds, are essentially sharp when the connectivity of the graph is sufficiently high.</description>

      <title>A phylogeny of biological patterns formed by nonlocal advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From tumour invasion to cell sorting and animal territoriality, many biological systems rely on nonlocal interactions that drive complex spatial organisation. Partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlocal advection are increasingly recognised as powerful tools for capturing such phenomena. However, most research has focused on one-dimensional domains, leaving their two-dimensional behaviour largely unexplored. Here, we present a detailed numerical study of the patterns formed by these systems on 2D domains. Depending on the underlying mechanisms, a wide variety of spatial patterns can emerge - including segregated clusters, stripes, volcanos, and polygonal mosaics - many of which have been observed in natural systems. By systematically varying model parameters, we classify the links between emergent patterns and their underlying movement mechanisms. In comparing these patterns with empirical observations, we show how this modelling framework can help reveal possible mechanisms of self-organisation in various situations within the life sciences, from ecology and developmental biology to cancer research.</description>

Abstract: The analytic and formal solutions to a family of singularly perturbed partial differential equations in the complex domain involving two complex time variables are considered. The analytic continuation properties of the solution of an auxiliary problem in the Borel plane overcomes the absence of adequate domains which would guarantee summability of the formal solution.
  Moreover, several exponential decay rates of the difference of analytic solutions with respect to the perturbation parameter at the origin are observed, leading to several asymptotic levels relating the analytic and the formal solution.</description>

      <title>Turnpike property of linear quadratic control problems with unbounded control operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the turnpike property for linear quadratic control problems for which the control operator is admissible and may be unbounded, under quite general and natural assumptions. The turnpike property has been well studied for bounded control operators, based on the theory of differential and algebraic Riccati equations. For unbounded control operators, there are only few results, limited to some special cases of hyperbolic systems in dimension one or to analytic semigroups. Our analysis is inspired by the pioneering work of Porretta and Zuazua \cite{PZ13}. We start by approximating the admissible control operator with a sequence of bounded ones. We then prove the convergence of the approximate problems to the initial one in a suitable sense. Establishing this convergence is the core of the paper. It requires to revisit in some sense the linear quadratic optimal control theory with admissible control operators, in which the roles of energy and adjoint states, and the connection between infinite-horizon and finite-horizon optimal control problems with an appropriate final cost are investigated.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition and well-posedness of Cauchy problem for Fokker-Planck equations with unbounded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the partial differential operator $L$ with low regularity condition. To address uniqueness, we apply a recently developed superposition principle for unbounded coefficients, which reduces the uniqueness problem for the Fokker-Planck equation to the uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem. Using the Cholesky decomposition algorithm, a standard tool in numerical linear algebra, we construct a lower triangular matrix of functions $\sigma$ with suitable regularity such that $A = \sigma \sigma^T$. This formulation allows us to connect the uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem with the uniqueness of weak solutions to It\^{o}-SDEs. For existence, we rely on established results concerning sub-Markovian semigroups, which enable us to confirm the existence of solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation under general growth conditions expressed as inequalities. Additionally, by imposing further growth conditions on the coefficients, also expressed as inequalities, we establish the ergodicity of the solutions. This work demonstrates the interplay between stochastic analysis and numerical linear algebra in addressing problems related to partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural proper- ties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact em- beddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract inter- polation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

Abstract: This book is devoted to the study of the linear and nonlinear stability of shear flows and boundary layers for Navier Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the case of small viscosity. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive presentation to recent advances on boundary layers stability. It targets graduate students and researchers in mathematical fluid dynamics and only assumes that the readers have a basic knowledge on ordinary differential equations and complex analysis. No prerequisites are required in fluid mechanics, excepted a basic knowledge on Navier Stokes and Euler equations, including Leray's theorem.
  This book consists of three parts. Part I is devoted to the presentation of classical results and methods: Green functions techniques, resolvent techniques, analytic functions. Part II focuses on the linear analysis, first of Rayleigh equations, then of Orr Sommerfeld equations. This enables the construction of Green functions for Orr Sommerfeld, and then the construction of the resolvent of linearized Navier Stokes equations. Part III details the construction of approximate solutions for the complete nonlinear problem and nonlinear instability results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of sharp fronts: Analysis and rigorous computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of traveling front solutions to nonlinear diffusive-dispersive equations of Burgers type, with a primary focus on the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdVB) equation, although our analytical findings extend more broadly. Manipulating the temporal modulation of the translation parameter of the front and employing the energy method, we establish asymptotic, nonlinear, and orbital stability, provided that an auxiliary Schr\"odinger equation possesses precisely one bound state. Notably, our result is independent of the monotonicity of the profile and does not necessitate the initial condition to be close to the front. We identify a sufficient condition for stability based on a functional that characterizes the 'width' of the traveling wave profile. Analytical verification for the KdVB equation confirms that this sufficient condition holds for the relative dispersion parameter within an open interval $\nu \in [-0.25,0.25]$, encompassing all monotone profiles. Utilizing validated numerics or rigorous computation, we present acomputer-assisted proof demonstrating that the stability condition itself holds for parameter values within the interval [0.2533, 3.9].</description>

      <title>Stability of solitary waves for generalized $abcd$-Boussinesq system: The Hamiltonian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $abcd$-Boussinesq system is a model of two equations that can describe the propagation of small-amplitude long waves in both directions in the water of finite depth. Considering the Hamiltonian regimes, where the parameters $b$ and $d$ in the system satisfy $b=d&gt;0$, small solutions in the energy space are globally defined. Then, a variational approach is applied to establish the existence and nonlinear stability of the set of solitary-wave solutions for the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system. The main point of the analysis is to show that the traveling-wave solutions of the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system converge to nontrivial solitary-wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation. Moreover, if $p$ is the exponent of the nonlinear terms for the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system, then the nonlinear stability of the set of solitary-waves is obtained for any $p$ with $ 0 &lt; p &lt; p_0$ where $p_0 $ is strictly larger than $4$, while it has been known that the critical exponent for the stability of solitary waves of the generalized KdV equations is equal to $ 4$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Perturbations in the Fractional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation: Well-posedness and Blow-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates radial solutions for nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equations driven by multiplicative noise. Leveraging radial deterministic and stochastic Strichartz estimates, we establish local well-posedness in the energy-subcritical regime for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Global existence is subsequently demonstrated through stochastic evolution of mass and energy. In focusing supercritical settings, we derive blow-up criteria via localized virial inequality, revealing how multiplicative noise measurably suppresses blow-up formation compared to deterministic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves the local-in-time strong well-posedness of a parabolic-hyperbolic regularized version of Hibler's sea ice model. Hibler's model is the most frequently used sea ice model in climate science. Lagrangian coordinates are employed to handle the hyperbolic terms in the balance laws. The resulting problem is regarded as a quasilinear non-autonomous evolution equation. Maximal $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity of the underlying linearized problem is obtained on an anisotropic ground space in order to deal with the lack of regularization in the balance laws.</description>

Abstract: We propose a possible nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional, in the sense of Gamma-convergence, based on the first variation ot the fractional Allen-Cahn energies, and we prove the corresponding $\Gamma$-limsup estimate. Our analysis is based on the expansion of the fractional Laplacian in Fermi coordinates and fine estimates on the decay of higher order derivatives of the one-dimensional nonlocal optimal profile. This result is the nonlocal counterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a phase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first variation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.</description>

Abstract: We apply the method of inverse iteration to the Laplace eigenvalue problem with Robin and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, respectively. For each problem, we prove convergence of the iterates to a non-trivial principal eigenfunction and show that the corresponding Rayleigh quotients converge to the principal eigenvalue. We also propose a related iterative method for an eigenvalue problem arising from a model for optimal insulation and provide some partial results.</description>

      <title>Regularity for Weak Solutions to First-Order Local Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish interior regularity results for first-order, stationary, local mean-field game (MFG) systems. Specifically, we study solutions of the coupled system consisting of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation $H(x, Du, m) = 0$ and a transport equation $-\operatorname{div}(m D_pH(x, Du, m)) = 0$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Under suitable structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian $H$, without requiring monotonicity of the system, convexity of the Hamiltonian, separability in variables, or smoothness beyond basic continuity in $(p,m)$, we introduce a notion of weak solutions that allows the application of techniques from elliptic regularity theory. Our main contribution is to prove that the value function $u$ is locally H\"older continuous in $\Omega$. The proof leverages the connection between first-order MFG systems and quasilinear equations in divergence form, adapting classical techniques to handle the specific structure of MFG systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the study of eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi equations posed on networks performed by Siconolfi and Sorrentino (Anal. PDE, 2018) to a more general setting. Their approach essentially exploits that such equations correspond to discrete problems on an abstract underlying graph. However, a specific condition they assume can be rather restricting in some settings, which motivates the generalization we propose. We still get an Aubry set, which plays the role of a uniqueness set for our problem and appears in the representation of solutions. Exploiting it we establish a new comparison principle between super and subsolutions to the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves $L^p$ decay estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger's and wave equations with scalar potentials on three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.
  The main result regards small perturbations of a metric with constant negative sectional curvature. We also prove estimates on $\mathbb S^3$, the three-dimensional sphere, and $\mathbb H^3$, the three-dimensional hyperbolic space.
  Most of the estimates hold for the perturbed Hamiltonian $H=H_0+V$, where $H_0$ is the shifted Laplacian $H_0=-\Delta+\kappa_0$, $\kappa_0$ is the constant (or asymptotic) sectional curvature, and $V$ is a small scalar potential.
  The results are based on direct estimates of the wave propagator.
  All results hold in three space dimensions. The metric is required to have four derivatives.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (arXiv:2502.02847).</description>

      <title>Multi-bubble solutions for the Dirichlet problem of the $H$-system with higher degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Dirichlet problem of the $H$-system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \Delta v = 2v_x\wedge v_y ~&amp; \text{ in }\mathcal{D},\\ v=\varepsilon \tilde g ~&amp; \text{ on }\partial{\mathcal{D}}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\mathcal D\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the unit disk, $v:\mathcal D\to \mathbb{R}^3$, and $\tilde g:\partial \mathcal D\to \mathbb{R}^3$ is a given smooth map. As $\varepsilon\to 0^+$, we construct multi-bubble solutions concentrating at distinct points, taking around each point the profile of degree 2 $H$-bubble. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture due to Brezis-Coron and Chanillo-Malchiodi concerning the limiting configuration in the case of higher degrees. This seems to be the first construction in employing higher-degree harmonic maps as the primary configurations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. Under the condition that the flow map fails to be twice differentiable, Hirayama, Kinoshita, and Okamoto (2022) proved the well-posedness by constructing a modified energy and applying the energy method. In the present paper, we improve the well-posedness result under the above condition by using the short-time Fourier restriction norm method.</description>

      <title>Determining evolutionary equations by a single passive boundary observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of inverse boundary problems for evolutionary equations with a single passive boundary observation, focusing on hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We establish unique identifiability results for simultaneously determining several key parameters, including the wave/diffusion speed $c$, causal sources $f$ and $h$, and conductivity tensor $\sigma$, under generic conditions. As a central application, we provide a complete resolution to the joint reconstruction problem in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT), proving for the first time that both the initial pressure distribution $f$ and the heterogeneous sound speed $c$ can be uniquely and simultaneously determined from just a single, passive, partial boundary observation. We develop a novel, state-of-the-art framework that exploits the full spectral content of the wave field, combining both low-frequency and high-frequency asymptotics. Our approach avoids artificial decoupling assumptions and extends to general domain geometries and general evolutionary equations. This result resolves a long-standing open problem in coupled-physics imaging and provides a rigorous mathematical framework for addressing similar inverse problems in more sophisticated evolutionary setups.</description>

      <title>Damping Effects on Global Existence and Scattering for an Inhomogeneous NLS Equation with Inverse-Square Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the global existence and scattering behavior of solutions to a damped, inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrodinger equation featuring a time-dependent damping term, an inverse-square potential, and an inhomogeneous nonlinearity. We establish global well-posedness in the energy space for subcritical, mass-critical, and energy-critical regimes, using Strichartz estimates, Hardy inequalities, and Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type estimates. For sufficiently large damping, we highlight how the interplay between damping, singular potentials, and inhomogeneity influences the dynamics. Our results extend existing studies and offer new insights into the long-time behavior of solutions in this more general setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the combined effects of inverse-square potential, inhomogeneous (or even homogeneous) nonlinearity, and damping in the context of the NLS equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the ground state solutions of a class of (2,q)-Laplacian Schr\"odinger equations with inhomogeneous nonlinearity. By analyzing global and local constrained variational problems, we establish the existence, non-existence, and asymptotic behavior of ground states, addressing the mass-subcritical,mass-critical, and mass-supercritical regimes. As a byproduct, we prove a multiplicity of bound states with prescribed mass. Some of our existence results are sharp. The proofs are based primarily on constrained variational techniques.</description>

      <title>On the time-decay with the diffusion wave phenomenon of the solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system in critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \ge 2$). The purposes of this paper are to obtain the global-in-time solution around the constant equilibrium states $(\rho_*,0)$ and investigate the $L^p$-$L^1$ type time-decay estimates in a scaling critical framework, where $\rho_*&gt;0$ is a constant. In addition, we study the diffusion wave property came from the wave equation with strong damping for the solution with the initial data belonging to the critical Besov space. The key idea of the proof is the derivation of the time-decay for the Fourier-Besov norm with higher derivatives by using $L^1$-maximal regularity for the perturbed equations around $(\rho_*,0)$.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of the Kuramoto Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kuramoto model on a graph with nodes given by $n$ i.i.d. points uniformly distributed on the $d$ dimensional torus. Two nodes are declared neighbors if they are at distance less than $\epsilon$. We prove a scaling limit for this model in compact time intervals as $n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ such that $\epsilon^{d+2}n/\log n \to \infty$. The limiting object is given by the heat equation. On the one hand this shows that the nonlinearity given by the sine function disappears under this scaling and on the other hand, provides evidence that stable equilibria of the Kuramoto model on these graphs are, as $n\to\infty$, in correspondence with those of the heat equation, which are explicit and given by twisted states. In view of this, we conjecture the existence of twisted stable equilibria with high probability as $n\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Log-PDE Methods for Rough Signature Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signature kernels, inner products of path signatures, underpin several machine learning algorithms for multivariate time series analysis. For bounded variation paths, signature kernels were recently shown to solve a Goursat PDE. However, existing PDE solvers only use increments as input data, leading to first order approximation errors. These approaches become computationally intractable for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. In this paper, we extend the analysis to rough paths, and show, leveraging the framework of smooth rough paths, that the resulting rough signature kernels can be approximated by a novel system of PDEs whose coefficients involve higher order iterated integrals of the input rough paths. We show that this system of PDEs admits a unique solution and establish quantitative error bounds yielding a higher order approximation to rough signature kernels.</description>

      <title>Long time quantum-classical correspondence for open systems in trace norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

      <title>An inverse obstacle scattering problem with passive data in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers a time domain inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem due to passive data. Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data in passive imaging to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data in passive imaging. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Derivation of the Two-Component Gross--Pitaevskii Equation in the Hard-Core Limit with Uniform-in-Time Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the time-dependent two-component Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation as an effective description of the dynamics of a dilute two-component Bose gas near its ground state, which exhibits a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, in the GP limit. Our main result establishes a uniform-in-time bound on the convergence rate between the many-body dynamics and the effective description, explicitly quantified in terms of the particle number $N$, and also implies a uniform-in-time bound for the one-component case. This improves upon the works of Michelangeli and Olgliati [77, 89] by providing a sharper, $N$-dependent, time-independent convergence rate. Our approach further extends the framework of Benedikter, de Oliveira, and Schlein [10] to the multi-component Bose gas in the hard-core limit setting. More specifically, we develop the necessary Bogoliubov theory to analyze the dynamics of multi-component Bose gases in the GP regime.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.
  Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data. Moreover, within the class of solutions with density, we establish the uniqueness under slightly more restrictive conditions on the kernel.</description>

      <title>Quadratic convergence of an SQP method for some optimization problems with applications to control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a sequential quadratic programming algorithm for solving a class of abstract optimization problems. Assuming that the initial point is in an $L^2$ neighborhood of a local solution that satisfies no-gap second-order sufficient optimality conditions and a strict complementarity condition, we obtain stability and quadratic convergence in $L^q$ for all $q\in[p,\infty]$ where $p\geq 2$ depends on the problem. Many of the usual optimal control problems of partial differential equations fit into this abstract formulation. Some examples are given in the paper. Finally, a computational comparison with other versions of the SQP method is presented.</description>
