      <title>On computational schemes for the Magnus expansion of the in-medium similarity renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) is a popular many-body method used for computations of nuclei. It solves the many-body Schr\"odinger equation through a continuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian. The IMSRG transformation is typically truncated at the normal-ordered two-body level, the IMSRG(2), but recently several approaches have been developed to capture the effects of normal-ordered three-body operators, the IMSRG(3). In particular, a factorized approximation to the IMSRG(3) proposes to capture the leading effects of three-body operators at the same computational cost as the IMSRG(2) approximation. This approach often employs an approximate scheme for solving the IMSRG equations, the so-called hunter-gatherer scheme. In this work, I study the uncertainty associated with this scheme. I find that the hunter-gatherer scheme differs by up to $7\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for ground-state energies and $0.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for excitation energies from standard IMSRG(2) approaches. These differences are in some cases comparable to the expected size of IMSRG(3) corrections.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} Gamow density matrix renormalization group for broad nuclear many-body resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background} The reach of \textit{ab initio} theory has greatly increased in recent decades. However, predicting the location of the drip lines remains challenging due to uncertainties in nuclear forces and difficulties in describing nuclei that behave as open quantum systems. \textbf{Purpose} In this work, we extend the \textit{ab initio} Gamow Density Matrix Renormalization Group (G-DMRG) approach to the regime of broad many-body resonances to pave the way for systematic tests of nuclear forces in light exotic nuclei. \textbf{Methods} To stabilize calculations, we introduce a new truncation scheme in the reference space, and propose an orbital ordering based on entanglement considerations. We then show how continuum couplings increase entanglement in the many-body problem, and propose a new truncation scheme to stabilize the renormalization and accelerate calculations in extreme conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that natural orbitals can be used to efficiently describe broad resonances by introducing a new ordering scheme and by redefining the reference space based on occupations. \textbf{Results} Leveraging our findings, we propose a recipe to converge \textit{ab initio} G-DMRG calculations and apply it in low-lying states of \isotope[5,6]{He} and \isotope[4]{H}, demonstrating control of the renormalization and the emergence of convergence patterns. We also obtain the first direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of the $J^\pi = {1/2}^+$ ground state of \isotope[5]{H}. \textbf{Conclusions} We demonstrate that entanglement due to continuum couplings can be controlled in extreme conditions and successfully extend the G-DMRG approach in the regime of broad many-body resonances.</description>

      <title>Decay Effect on Near-Threshold Mass Scaling with Complex and Coupled-Channel Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of decay channels on the near-threshold mass scaling by employing potential models. By varying the attractive strength of a square-well potential, we examine the pole trajectory associated with the transition of an $s$-wave bound state into a resonance state, incorporating decay-channel effects through both a single-channel complex potential model and a coupled-channel real potential model. As a result, we show that the pole of a quasibound state below the threshold is not continuously connected to that of a resonance state above the threshold. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from the single-channel and coupled-channel models, we clarify the correspondence between the pole trajectories in the two approaches.</description>

      <title>String Breaking and Glueball Dynamics in $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.</description>

      <title>Giant Dipole Resonance and Related Spin-dependent Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation is solved by the Wigner Function Moments method taking into account spin degrees of freedom. Energies and reduced transition probabilities of $K^\pi=0^-$, $1^-$ and $2^-$ excitations are calculated taking $^{164}$Dy as an example. The spin degrees of freedom give rise to the electric Spin Dipole Resonance. Its properties and interplay with the Giant Dipole Resonance are investigated. The deformation-induced splitting of the spin $M2$ resonance is discussed. The results of calculations are compared with the experimental data and other theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>$\Xi NN$ three-baryon force from SU(3) chiral effective field theory: A femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The development of SU(3) chiral effective field theory has opened the way to a systematic exploration of three-baryon forces (3BFs), a key ingredient in hypernuclear and dense matter physics. However, $\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.
  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT to derive $\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron--$\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.
  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained. The deuteron--$\Xi^-$ scattering is treated as an effective two-body problem with the $\Xi NN$ 3BF incorporated into the potential between the deuteron and $\Xi^-$.
  Results: We found that the effect of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron--$\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4\%. This small effect is not primarily due to the loosely-bound nature of the deuteron. Instead, this is because the deuteron and $\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.
  Conclusions: Since the correlation function shows limited sensitivity to the short-range 3BF, complementary approaches may be necessary.</description>

      <title>An improved formula for Wigner function and spin polarization in a decoupling relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an upgraded formula for Wigner function and spin polarization of fermions emitted by a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the decoupling which improves the one obtained in refs. [1, 2] and used in numerical simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions can relieve major compact star observation tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii in the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of self-bound hybrid stars with large density discontinuities, and thus are radially stable in either the slow or rapid phase transition context. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>
