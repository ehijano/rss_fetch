      <title>Data journeys in popular science: Producing climate change and COVID-19 data visualizations at Scientific American</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vast amounts of (open) data are increasingly used to make arguments about crisis topics such as climate change and global pandemics. Data visualizations are central to bringing these viewpoints to broader publics. However, visualizations often conceal the many contexts involved in their production, ranging from decisions made in research labs about collecting and sharing data to choices made in editorial rooms about which data stories to tell. In this paper, we examine how data visualizations about climate change and COVID-19 are produced in popular science magazines, using Scientific American, an established English-language popular science magazine, as a case study. To do this, we apply the analytical concept of data journeys (Leonelli, 2020) in a mixed methods study that centers on interviews with Scientific American staff and is supplemented by a visualization analysis of selected charts. In particular, we discuss the affordances of working with open data, the role of collaborative data practices, and how the magazine works to counter misinformation and increase transparency. This work provides an empirical contribution by providing insight into the data (visualization) practices of science communicators and demonstrating how the concept of data journeys can be used as an analytical framework.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. To remain within the athlete's capacity, we examine the effect of complementing the average-power constraint with a maximum-power constraint. Even with this additional constraint, the ascent time is the shortest with a modified constant-speed -- not constant-power -- strategy; as expected, both strategies result in the same time if the maximum and average powers are equal to one another. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow to formulate reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.</description>
