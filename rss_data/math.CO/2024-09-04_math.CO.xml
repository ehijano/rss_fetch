      <title>Some inner metric parameters of a digraph: Iterated line digraphs and integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first give a new result characterizing the strongly connected digraphs with a diameter equal to that of their line digraphs. Then, we introduce the concepts of the inner diameter and inner radius of a digraph and study their behaviors in its iterated line digraphs. Furthermore, we provide a method to characterize sequences of integers (corresponding to the inner diameter or the number of vertices of a digraph and its iterated line digraphs) that satisfy some conditions. Among other examples, we apply the method to the cyclic Kautz digraphs, square-free digraphs, and the subdigraphs of De Bruijn digraphs. Finally, we present some tables with new sequences that do not belong to The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>A Study On The Graph Formulation Of Union Closed Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Union Closed Conjecture, posed by Peter Frankl in 1979, is one of the most renowned problems in Combinatorics. Its appeal stems from the simplicity of its statement and the potential complexity of its solution. The conjecture asserts that in any union-closed family of sets, there exists an element that belongs to at least half of the sets in the family.
  This paper explores the graph-theoretic formulation of the conjecture and establishes connections between the set-based and graph-based formulations. Through this connection, we derive new results and provide proofs for specific classes of graphs. Additionally, by analyzing the distribution of pendant vertices within various graphs, we demonstrate the validity of the conjecture for a broader range of graph classes.</description>

      <title>Limits and Periodicity of Metamour $2$-Distance Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$, let $\operatorname{M}(G)$ denote its 2-distance graph, in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if they have distance 2 in $G$. In this paper, we consider the periodic behavior of the sequence $G, \operatorname{M}(G), \operatorname{M}^2(G), \operatorname{M}^3(G), \ldots$ obtained by iterating the 2-distance operation. In particular, we classify the connected graphs with period 3, and we partially characterize those with period 2. We then study two families of graphs whose 2-distance sequence is eventually periodic: namely, generalized Petersen graphs and complete $m$-ary trees. For each family, we show that the eventual period is 2, and we determine the pre-period and the two limit graphs of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Structures on Graphs Joined by Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the join of two graphs be the union of two disjoint graphs connected by $j$ edges in a one-to-one manner. In previous work by Gyurov and Pinzon, which generalized the work of Badura and Rara, the determinant of the two joined graphs was decomposed to sums of determinants of these graphs with vertex deletions or directed graph handles. In this paper, we define a homomorphism from a quotient of graphs with the join operation to the monoid of integer matrices. We find the necessary and sufficient properties of a graph so that joining to any another graph will not change its determinant. We also demonstrate through examples that this decomposition allows us to more easily calculate determinants of chains of joined graphs. This paper begins the process of finding the algebraic structure of the monoid.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of a cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 2,4,6$. Until our work, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter 2 had been identified except for subclasses of complete graphs. Finally, we give a complete characterization of the oriented diameter of the power graphs of nilpotent groups. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Combined voltage assignments, factored lifts, and their spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider lifting eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graphs to their {\em factored lifts}, derived by means of a {\em combined voltage assignment} in a group. The latter extends the concept of (ordinary) voltage assignments known from regular coverings and corresponds to the cases of generalized covers of Poto\v{c}nik and Toledo (2021) in which a group of automorphisms of a lift acts freely on its arc set. With the help of group representations and certain matrices over complex group rings associated with the graphs to be lifted, we develop a method for the determination of the complete spectra of the factored lift graphs and derive a sufficient condition for lifting eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Four fault-free $B_{n-2}$'s in $B_{n}$ under the random node fault model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 4$. Each $B_{n-2}$ in $B_n$ has one of the forms $a_1a_2X^{n-2}$, $a_1X^{n-2}a_2$ and $X^{n-2}a_1a_2$. Let $1-p$ be the fault probiability of each node in the $n$-dimensional bubble-sort network $B_{n}$ under the random node fault model. In this paper, we determine the probability that there are four distinct fault-free $B_{n-2}$'s in $B_{n}$ by considering all possible combinatorial cases of the four fault-free $B_{n-2}$'s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. The first Zagreb index of a graph $G$ is defined as $\sum_{u \in V} d^2(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of vertex $u$ in $G$. Using the P\'{o}lya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, we in this paper present the first Zagreb index conditions for some Hamiltonian properties of a graph and an upper bound for the first Zagreb index of a graph.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the trace norm of $A_{\alpha}$ matrix of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a digraph of order $n$ with adjacency matrix $A(D)$. For $\alpha\in[0,1)$, the $A_{\alpha}$ matrix of $D$ is defined as $A_{\alpha}(D)=\alpha {\Delta}^{+}(D)+(1-\alpha)A(D)$, where ${\Delta}^{+}(D)=\mbox{diag}~(d_1^{+},d_2^{+},\dots,d_n^{+})$ is the diagonal matrix of vertex outdegrees of $D$. Let $\sigma_{1\alpha}(D),\sigma_{2\alpha}(D),\dots,\sigma_{n\alpha}(D)$ be the singular values of $A_{\alpha}(D)$. Then the trace norm of $A_{\alpha}(D)$, which we call $\alpha$ trace norm of $D$, is defined as $\|A_{\alpha}(D)\|_*=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i\alpha}(D)$. In this paper, we find the singular values of some basic digraphs and characterize the digraphs $D$ with $\mbox{Rank}~(A_{\alpha}(D))=1$. As an application of these results, we obtain a lower bound for the trace norm of $A_{\alpha}$ matrix of digraphs and determine the extremal digraphs. In particular, we determine the oriented trees for which the trace norm of $A_{\alpha}$ matrix attains minimum. We obtain a lower bound for the $\alpha$ spectral norm $\sigma_{1\alpha}(D)$ of digraphs and characterize the extremal digraphs. As an application of this result, we obtain an upper bound for the $\alpha$ trace norm of digraphs and characterize the extremal digraphs.</description>

      <title>On the critical group of the k-partite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical group of a connected graph is closely related to the graph Laplacian, and is of high research value in combinatorics, algebraic geometry, statistical physics, and several other areas of mathematics. In this paper, we study the k-partite graphs and introduce an algorithm to get the structure of their critical groups by calculating the Smith normal forms of their graph Laplacians. When k is from 2 to 6, we characterize the structure of the critical groups completely, which can generalize the results of the complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterisation of the cubic graphs with no eigenvalues in the open interval $(-1,1)$. There are two infinite families, one due to Guo and Mohar [Linear Algebra Appl. 449:68--75] the other due to Koll\'ar and Sarnak [Communications of the AMS. 1,1--38], and $14$ "sporadic" graphs on at most $32$ vertices. This allows us to show that $(-1,1)$ is a maximal spectral gap set for cubic graphs. Our techniques including examination of various substructure and an application of the classification of generalized line graphs.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Circular-arc Graphs: III. Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs, thereby resolving one of ``the main open problems'' concerning the structures of circular-arc graphs as posed by Dur{\'{a}}n, Grippo, and Safe in 2011. The problem had been attempted even earlier, and previous efforts have yielded partial results, particularly for claw-free graphs and graphs with an independence number of at most four. The answers turn out to have very simple structures: all the nontrivial ones belong to a single family. Our findings are based on a structural study of McConnell's flipping, which transforms circular-arc graphs into interval graphs with certain representation patterns.</description>

In this note, we extend their proof to determine the codegree Tur\'an density of the 3-uniform tight cycle $C_{11}$, thereby completing the picture for tight cycles of length at least 10.</description>

      <title>Packing and finding paths in sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G\sim G(n,p)$ be a (hidden) Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with $p=(1+ \varepsilon)/n$ for some fixed constant $ \varepsilon &gt;0$. Ferber, Krivelevich, Sudakov, and Vieira showed that to reveal a path of length $\ell=\Omega\left(\frac{\log(1/ \varepsilon)}{ \varepsilon}\right)$ in $G$ with high probability, one must query the adjacency of $\Omega\left(\frac{\ell}{p \varepsilon\log(1/ \varepsilon)}\right)$ pairs of vertices in $G$, where each query may depend on the outcome of all previous queries. Their result is tight up to the factor of $\log(1/ \varepsilon)$ in both $\ell$ and the number of queries, and they conjectured that this factor could be removed. We confirm their conjecture. The main ingredient in our proof is a result about path-packings in random labelled trees of independent interest. Using this, we also give a partial answer to a related question of Ferber, Krivelevich, Sudakov, and Vieira. Namely, we show that when $\ell=o\left((t/\log t)^{1/3}\right)$, the maximum number of vertices covered by edge-disjoint paths of length at least $\ell$ in a random labelled tree of size $t$ is $\Theta(t/\ell)$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Directed Hypercube Routing, a Generalized Lehman-Ron Theorem, and Monotonicity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to monotonicity testing, Lehman and Ron (JCTA, 2001) proved the existence of a collection of vertex disjoint paths between comparable sub-level sets in the directed hypercube. The main technical contribution of this paper is a new proof method that yields a generalization to their theorem: we prove the existence of two edge-disjoint collections of vertex disjoint paths. Our main conceptual contribution are conjectures on directed hypercube flows with simultaneous vertex and edge capacities of which our generalized Lehman-Ron theorem is a special case. We show that these conjectures imply directed isoperimetric theorems, and in particular, the robust directed Talagrand inequality due to Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SIAM J. on Comp, 2018). These isoperimetric inequalities, that relate the directed surface area (of a set in the hypercube) to its distance to monotonicity, have been crucial in obtaining the best monotonicity testers for Boolean functions. We believe our conjectures pave the way towards combinatorial proofs of these directed isoperimetry theorems.</description>

      <title>$p$-numerical semigroups with $p$-symmetric properties, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of the $p$-numerical semigroup with $p$-symmetric properties has been introduced. When $p=0$, the classical numerical semigroup with symmetric properties is recovered. In this paper, we further study the $p$-numerical semigroup with $p$-almost symmetric properties. We also give $p$-generalized formulas of Watanabe and Johnson, and introduce $p$-Arf numerical semigroup and study its properties.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on rhombus tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2-boostrap percolation on a graph is a diffusion process where a vertex gets infected whenever it has at least 2 infected neighbours, and then stays infected forever. It has been much studied on the infinite grid for random Bernoulli initial configurations, starting from the seminal result of van Enter that establishes that the entire grid gets almost surely entirely infected for any non-trivial initial probability of infection. In this paper, we generalize this result to any adjacency graph of any rhombus tiling of the plane, including aperiodic ones like Penrose tilings. We actually show almost sure infection of the entire graph for a larger class of measure than non-trivial Bernoulli ones. Our proof strategy combines a geometry toolkit for infected clusters based on chain-convexity, and uniform probabilistic bounds on particular geometric patterns that play the role of 0-1 laws or ergodicity, which are not available in our settings due to the lack of symmetry of the graph considered.</description>

      <title>The entries of the Sinkhorn limit of an $m \times n$ matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Gr\"obner bases to compute the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $3 \times 3$ matrix $A$, showing that the entries are algebraic numbers with degree at most 6. The polynomial equation satisfied by each entry is large, but we show that it has a natural representation in terms of linear combinations of products of minors of $A$. We then use this representation to interpolate a polynomial equation satisfied by an entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $4 \times 4$ matrix. Finally, we use the PSLQ algorithm and 1.5 years of CPU time to formulate a conjecture, up to certain signs that we have not been able to identify, for a polynomial equation satisfied by an entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $m \times n$ matrix. In particular, we conjecture that the entries are algebraic numbers with degree at most $\binom{m + n - 2}{m - 1}$. This degree has a combinatorial interpretation as the number of minors of an $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix, and the coefficients reflect new combinatorial structure on sets of minor specifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.14203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two characterisations of accessibility of locally finite quasi-transitive connected graphs. First, we prove that any such graph $G$ is accessible if and only if its set of separations of finite order is an ${\rm Aut}(G)$-finitely generated semiring. The second characterisation says that $G$ is accessible if and only if every process of splittings in terms of tree amalgamations stops after finitely many steps.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions VI. Graphs with 2-cutsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues a series of papers investigating the following question: which hereditary graph classes have bounded treewidth? We call a graph $t$-clean if it does not contain as an induced subgraph the complete graph $K_t$, the complete bipartite graph $K_{t, t}$, subdivisions of a $(t \times t)$-wall, and line graphs of subdivisions of a $(t \times t)$-wall. It is known that graphs with bounded treewidth must be $t$-clean for some $t$; however, it is not true that every $t$-clean graph has bounded treewidth. In this paper, we show that three types of cutsets, namely clique cutsets, 2-cutsets, and 1-joins, interact well with treewidth and with each other, so graphs that are decomposable by these cutsets into basic classes of bounded treewidth have bounded treewidth. We apply this result to two hereditary graph classes, the class of ($ISK_4$, wheel)-free graphs and the class of graphs with no cycle with a unique chord. These classes were previously studied and decomposition theorems were obtained for both classes. Our main results are that $t$-clean ($ISK_4$, wheel)-free graphs have bounded treewidth and that $t$-clean graphs with no cycle with a unique chord have bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Combinations without specified separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the restricted subsets of $\mathbb{N}_n=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with $q\geq1$ being the largest member of the set $\mathcal{Q}$ of disallowed differences between subset elements. We obtain new results on various classes of problem involving such combinations lacking specified separations. In particular, we find recursion relations for the number of $k$-subsets for any $\mathcal{Q}$ when $|\mathbb{N}_q-\mathcal{Q}|\leq2$. The results are obtained, in a quick and intuitive manner, as a consequence of a bijection we give between such subsets and the restricted-overlap tilings of an $(n+q)$-board (a linear array of $n+q$ square cells of unit width) with squares ($1\times1$ tiles) and combs. A $(w_1,g_1,w_2,g_2,\ldots,g_{t-1},w_t)$-comb is composed of $t$ sub-tiles known as teeth. The $i$-th tooth in the comb has width $w_i$ and is separated from the $(i+1)$-th tooth by a gap of width $g_i$. Here we only consider combs with $w_i,g_i\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. When performing a restricted-overlap tiling of a board with such combs and squares, the leftmost cell of a tile must be placed in an empty cell whereas the remaining cells in the tile are permitted to overlap other non-leftmost filled cells of tiles already on the board.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions X. Towards logarithmic treewidth for even-hole-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized $t$-pyramid is a graph obtained from a certain kind of tree (a subdivided star or a subdivided cubic caterpillar) and the line graph of a subdivided cubic caterpillar by identifying simplicial vertices. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exists a constant $c(t)$ such that every $n$-vertex even-hole-free graph with no clique of size $t$ and no induced subgraph isomorphic to a generalized $t$-pyramid has treewidth at most $c(t)\log{n}$. This settles a special case of a conjecture of Sintiari and Trotignon; this bound is also best possible for the class. It follows that several \textsf{NP}-hard problems such as \textsc{Stable Set}, \textsc{Vertex Cover}, \textsc{Dominating Set} and \textsc{Coloring} admit polynomial-time algorithms on this class of graphs. Results from this paper are also used in later papers of the series, in particular to solve the full version of the Sintiari-Trotignon conjecture.</description>

      <title>Maximal Cliques in Scale-Free Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the number of maximal cliques, i.e., cliques that are not contained in any larger clique, in three network models: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, inhomogeneous random graphs (also called Chung-Lu graphs), and geometric inhomogeneous random graphs. For sparse and not-too-dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we give linear and polynomial upper bounds on the number of maximal cliques. For the dense regime, we give super-polynomial and even exponential lower bounds. Although (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs are sparse, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for these models. This comes from the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which leads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower bounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs have only few maximal cliques. We resolve this contradiction by providing experiments indicating that, even for large networks, the linear lower-order terms dominate, before the super-polynomial asymptotic behavior kicks in only for networks of extreme size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new determinantal formula for the characters of irreducible representations of orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras analogous to the formula developed by Moens and Jeugt (J. Algebraic Combin., 2003) for general linear Lie superalgebras. Our proof uses the Jacobi--Trudi type formulas for orthosymplectic characters. As a consequence, we show that the odd symplectic characters introduced by Proctor (Invent. Math., 1988) are the same as the orthosymplectic characters with some specialized indeterminates. We also give a generalization of an odd symplectic character identity due to Brent, Krattenthaler and Warnaar (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2016).</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we provide a cohomology group as a categorification of the characteristic polynomial of matroids. The construction depends on the ``quasi-representation'' of a matroid. For a certain choice of the quasi-representation, we show that our cohomology theory gives a generalization of the chromatic cohomology introduced by L. Helme-Guizon and Y. Rong, and also the characteristic cohomology introduced by Z. Dancso and A. Licata.</description>

We briefly discuss other possibilities, such as the string limit, some "magical" variants of Hackenbush, as well as "Dadaist" infinite sums, which allow transfinite runs, while still being loopfree.</description>

Abstract: The Ehrhart polynomial and Ehrhart series count lattice points in integer dilations of a lattice polytope. We introduce and study a $q$-deformation of the Ehrhart series, based on the notions of harmonic spaces and Macaulay's inverse systems for coordinate rings of finite point configurations. We conjecture that this $q$-Ehrhart series is a rational function, and introduce and study a bigraded algebra whose Hilbert series matches the $q$-Ehrhart series. Defining this algebra requires a new result on Macaulay inverse systems for Minkowski sums of point configurations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial properties of three classes of integer partitions: (1) $s$-modular partitions, a class consisting of partitions into parts with a number of occurrences (i.e., multiplicity) congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $s$, (2) $s$-congruent partitions, which generalize Sellers' partitions into parts not congruent to $2$ modulo $4$, and (3) $s$-duplicate partitions, of which the partitions having distinct odd parts and enumerated by the function $\mypod(n)$ are a special case. In this vein, we generalize Alladi's series expansion for the product generating function of $\mypod(n)$ and show that Andrews' generalization of G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities coincides with the number of partitions into parts simultaneously $s$-congruent and $t$-distinct (parts appearing fewer than $t$ times).</description>

Abstract: The entropic doubling $\sigma_{\operatorname{ent}}[X]$ of a random variable $X$ taking values in an abelian group $G$ is a variant of the notion of the doubling constant $\sigma[A]$ of a finite subset $A$ of $G$, but it enjoys somewhat better properties; for instance, it contracts upon applying a homomorphism.
  In this paper we develop further the theory of entropic doubling and give various applications, including:
  (1) A new proof of a result of P\'alv\"olgyi and Zhelezov on the ``skew dimension'' of subsets of $\mathbf{Z}^D$ with small doubling;
  (2) A new proof, and an improvement, of a result of the second author on the dimension of subsets of $\mathbf{Z}^D$ with small doubling;
  (3) A proof that the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbf{F}_2$ implies the (weak) Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbf{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating maps $f$ of degree $d$ from a fixed general curve $C$ of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$ satisfying incidence conditions of the form $f(p_i)\in X_i$, where $p_i\in C$ are general points and $X_i\subset\mathbb{P}^r$ are general linear spaces. We give a complete answer in the case where the $X_i$ are points, where the counts, the ``Tevelev degrees'' of $\mathbb{P}^r$, were previously known only when $r=1$, when $d$ is large compared to $r,g$, or virtually in Gromov-Witten theory. We also give a complete answer in the case $r=2$ with arbitrary incidence conditions. Our main approach studies the behavior of complete collineations under various degenerations.</description>

      <title>Capacitated Network Bargaining Games: Stability and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capacitated network bargaining games are popular combinatorial games that involve the structure of matchings in graphs. We show that it is always possible to stabilize unit-weight instances of this problem (that is, ensure that they admit a stable outcome) via capacity-reduction and edge-removal operations, without decreasing the total value that the players can get.
  Furthermore, for general weighted instances, we show that computing a minimum amount of vertex-capacity to reduce to make an instance stable is a polynomial-time solvable problem. We then exploit this to give approximation results for the NP-hard problem of stabilizing a graph via edge-removal operations.
  Our work extends and generalizes previous results in the literature that dealt with a unit-capacity version of the problem, using several new arguments. In particular, while previous results mainly used combinatorial techniques, we here rely on polyhedral arguments and, more specifically, on the notion of circuits of a polytope.</description>

Abstract: How complex two finite 2-complexes must be to admit a common, but not finite common, covering? We obtain an almost answer: the minimum possible number of triangles in a pseudo-simplicial triangulation of each complex is 3, 4, or 5.</description>

      <title>On the existence of magic squares of powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $d \geq 2$, we prove that there exists an integer $n_0(d)$ such that there exists an $n \times n$ magic square of $d^\text{th}$ powers for all $n \geq n_0(d)$. In particular, we establish the existence of an $n \times n$ magic square of squares for all $n \geq 4$, which settles a conjecture of V\'{a}rilly-Alvarado.
  All previous approaches had been based on constructive methods and the existence of $n \times n$ magic squares of $d^\text{th}$ powers had only been known for sparse values of $n$. We prove our result by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, which in this setting essentially reduces the problem to finding a sufficient number of disjoint linearly independent subsets of the columns of the coefficient matrix of the equations defining magic squares. We prove an optimal (up to a constant) lower bound for this quantity.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of theta functions as Traces of Partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08437v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his "lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of "partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace is $$ \text{Tr}_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_U;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_V;q),$ where $\phi_U$ and $\phi_V$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.</description>
