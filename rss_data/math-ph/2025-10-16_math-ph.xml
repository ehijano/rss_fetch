      <title>Electrostatic computations for statistical mechanics and random matrix applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although for the most part classical, the topic of electrostatics finds to this day new applications. In this review we highlight several theoretical results on electrostatics, chosen to both illustrate general principles, and for their application in statistical mechanics and random matrix settings. The theoretical results include electrostatic potentials and energies associated with balls and hyperellipsoids in general dimension, the use of conformal mappings in two-dimensions, and the balayage measure. A number of explicit examples of their use in predicting the leading asymptotic form of certain configuration integrals and particle density in particular statistical mechanical systems are given, as well as with regards to questions relating to fluctuation formulas and (conditioned) gap probabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations and Integrability of Quantum Field Theories with Time-dependent Interaction Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of solving quantum field theories with time dependent interaction strengths. We show that the recently formulated framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], which is a generalization of the regular Bethe ansatz technique, provides the exact many-body wavefunction. In this framework, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is reduced to a set of analytic difference equations and matrix difference equations, called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations. The consistency of the solution gives rise to constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths. For interaction strengths satisfying these constraints, the system is integrable, and the solution to the qKZ and the analytic difference equations provides the explicit form of the many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example by considering the $SU(2)$ Gross-Neveu model with time dependent interaction strength. Using this framework we solve the model with the most general time-dependent interaction strength and obtain the explicit form of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy DNA Bubble Dynamics via the Quantum Coulomb Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a low-energy model that can be used at any time to describe the dynamics of DNA bubbles at temperatures below the melting point. The Schr\"odinger equation associated with this problem is solved in imaginary time with a quantum Coulomb potential, and we obtain an approximate expression for its more general physical solution as a linear combination of the states whose energies are close to the lower bound energy. We can then determine the probability density, the first-passage time density, and the correlation functions in terms of Bessel functions. Our findings are consistent with results obtained directly from the Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with the Gamma and Diffusion models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sequential Quantum Measurements and the Instrumental Group Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of the most fundamental observables | position, momentum, phase-point, and spin-direction | cannot be measured by an instrument that obeys the orthogonal projection postulate. Continuous-in-time measurements provide the missing theoretical framework to make sense of such observables. The elements of the time-dependent instrument define a group called the \emph{instrumental group} (IG). Relative to the IG, all of the time-dependence is contained in a certain function called the \emph{Kraus-operator density} (KOD), which evolves according to a classical Kolmogorov equation. Unlike the Lindblad master equation, the KOD Kolmogorov equation is a direct expression of how the elements of the instrument (not just the total channel) evolve. Shifting from continuous measurement to sequential measurements more generally, the structure of combining instruments in sequence is shown to correspond to the convolution of their KODs. This convolution promotes the IG to an \emph{involutive Banach algebra} (a structure that goes all the way back to the origins of POVM and C*-algebra theory) which will be called the \emph{instrumental group algebra} (IGA). The IGA is the true home of the KOD, similar to how the dual of a von Neumann algebra is the home of the density operator. Operators on the IGA, which play the same role for KODs as superoperators play for density operators, are called \emph{ultraoperators} and various examples are discussed. Certain ultraoperator-superoperator intertwining relations are considered, including the relation between the KOD Kolmogorov equation and the Lindblad master equation. The IGA is also shown to have actually two involutions: one respected by the convolution ultraoperators and the other by the quantum channel superoperators. Finally, the KOD Kolmogorov generators are derived for jump processes and more general diffusive processes.</description>

      <title>Shadow Molecular Dynamics for Flexible Multipole Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadow molecular dynamics provide an efficient and stable atomistic simulation framework for flexible charge models with long-range electrostatic interactions. While previous implementations have been limited to atomic monopole charge distributions, we extend this approach to flexible multipole models. We derive detailed expressions for the shadow energy functions, potentials, and force terms, explicitly incorporating monopole-monopole, dipole-monopole, and dipole-dipole interactions. In our formulation, both atomic monopoles and atomic dipoles are treated as extended dynamical variables alongside the propagation of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that introducing the additional dipole degrees of freedom preserves the stability and accuracy previously seen in monopole-only shadow molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, we present a shadow molecular dynamics scheme where the monopole charges are held fixed while the dipoles remain flexible. Our extended shadow dynamics provide a framework for stable, computationally efficient, and versatile molecular dynamics simulations involving long-range interactions between flexible multipoles. This is of particular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop physics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations. These models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of atomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular systems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.</description>

      <title>Twistor Wilson loops in large-$N$ Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known for many years that, in Yang-Mills theories with $\mathcal{N}=4,2,2^*$ supersymmetry, certain nontrivial supersymmetric Wilson loops exist with v.e.v. either trivial or computable by localization that arises from a cohomological field theory, which also computes the nonperturbative prepotential in $\mathcal{N}=2,2^*$ theories. Moreover, some years ago it has been argued that, in analogy with the supersymmetric case, certain nontrivial twistor Wilson loops with trivial v.e.v. to the leading large-$N$ order exist in pure SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and are computed, to the leading large-$N$ order, by a topological field/string theory that, to the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order, conjecturally captures nonperturbative information on the glueball spectrum and glueball one-loop effective action as well. In fact, independently of the above, it has also been claimed that "every gauge theory with a mass gap should contain a possibly trivial topological field theory in the infrared", so that the aforementioned twistor Wilson loops realize a stronger version of this idea, as they have trivial v.e.v. at all energy scales and not only in the infrared. In the present paper, we provide a detailed proof of the triviality of the v.e.v. of twistor Wilson loops at the leading large-$N$ order in Yang-Mills theory that has previously been only sketched, opening the way to further developments.</description>

      <title>The Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime at the Big Bang as an Alternative to Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with $\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$, the set of solutions which agree with a $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Tracy-Widom distribution at large Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution $f_\beta(a)$ in the limit of large Dyson index $\beta \to +\infty$. This distribution describes the fluctuations of the rescaled largest eigenvalue $a_1$ of the Gaussian (alias Hermite) ensemble (G$\beta$E) of (infinitely) large random matrices. We show that, at large $\beta$, its probability density function takes the large deviation form $f_\beta(a) \sim e^{-\beta \Phi(a)}$. While the typical deviation of $a_1$ around its mean is Gaussian of variance $O(1/\beta)$, this large deviation form describes the probability of rare events with deviation $O(1)$, and governs the behavior of the higher cumulants. We obtain the rate function $\Phi(a)$ as a solution of a Painlev\'{e} II equation. We derive explicit formula for its large argument behavior, and for the lowest cumulants, up to order 4. We compute $\Phi(a)$ numerically for all $a$ and compare with exact numerical computations of the TW distribution at finite $\beta$. These results are obtained by applying saddle-point approximations to an associated problem of energy levels $E=-a$, for a random quantum Hamiltonian defined by the stochastic Airy operator (SAO). We employ two complementary approaches: (i) we use the optimal fluctuation method to find the most likely realization of the noise in the SAO, conditioned on its ground-state energy being $E$ (ii) we apply the weak-noise theory to the representation of the TW distribution in terms of a Ricatti diffusion process associated to the SAO. We extend our results to the full Airy point process $a_1&gt;a_2&gt;\dots$ which describes all edge eigenvalues of the G$\beta$E, and correspond to (minus) the higher energy levels of the SAO, obtaining large deviation forms for the marginal distribution of $a_i$, the joint distributions, and the gap distributions.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximate controllability of the logarithmic Schr\''dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr{\"o}dinger equations with logarithmic nonlinearity and bilinear controls, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove their small-time global $L^2$-approximate controllability. The proof consists in extending to this nonlinear framework the approach introduced by the first and third authors in \cite{beauchard-pozzoli2} to control the linear equation: it combines the small-time controllability of phases and gradient flows. Due to the nonlinearity, the required estimates are more difficult to establish than in the linear case. The proof here is inspired by WKB analysis. This is the first result of (small-time) global approximate controllability, for nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations, with bilinear controls.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue wave statistics for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs) emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values. Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However, during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in [12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.</description>

      <title>The tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of complex Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tt*-equation (topological-anti-topological fusion equation) was introduced by S. Cecotti and C. Vafa for describing massive deformation of supersymmetric conformal field theories. B. Dubrovin formulated the tt*-equation as a flat bundle, called tt*-structure. In this paper, we construct a tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian of complex \(k\)-plane and obtain global solutions to the tt*-equation, following the idea of Bourdeau. We give a precise mathematical formulation and a description of the solutions by using p.d.e. theory and the harmonic map theory developed by J. Dorfmeister, F. Pedit and H. Wu (the DPW method). Furthermore, we give an isomorphism between tt*-structure for the \(k\)-th exterior product of tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the complex projective space and the tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Landau levels in the almost-bosonic anyon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantitative description of a many-particle gas of interacting abelian anyons in the plane, confined in a trapping potential. If the anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the total magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an average-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective state of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a two-parameter Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger energy functional which extends the well-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger density functional theory to the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total number of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the effective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can be either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux profile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are studied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and align well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing Jackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices are formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from clarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have appeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the many-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel supersymmetry-breaking phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed matter systems for realizing these models.
  In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limitations on the recoverability of quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.</description>

      <title>AdS $N$-body problem at large spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of multi-twist operators in general CFTs, we study the leading-twist states of the $N$-body problem in AdS at large spin $J$. We find that for the majority of states the effective quantum-mechanical problem becomes semiclassical with $\hbar=1/J$. The classical system at $J=\infty$ has $N-2$ degrees of freedom, and the classical phase space is identified with the positive Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{+}(2,N)$. The quantum problem is recovered via a Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a classical Hamiltonian, which we describe explicitly. For $N=3$ the classical system has one degree of freedom and a detailed structure of the spectrum can be obtained from Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. For all $N$, we show that the lowest excited states are approximated by a harmonic oscillator and find explicit expressions for their energies.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of High-Order Exceptional Points through Transformation Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonic systems have attracted considerable research interest due to their singular eigenvalue topology and associated anomalous physical phenomena. These properties enable diverse applications ranging from enhanced quantum metrology to chiral light-matter interactions. Practical implementation of high order EPs in optical platforms however remains fundamentally challenging, requiring precise multi-parameter control that often exceeds conventional design capabilities. This work presents a novel framework for engineering high order EPs through transformation optics (TO) principles, establishing a direct correspondence between mathematical singularities and physically controllable parameters. Our TO-based paradigm addresses critical limitations in conventional Hamiltonian approaches, where abstract parameter spaces lack explicit connections to experimentally accessible degrees of freedom, while simultaneously providing full-field mode solutions. In contrast to prevailing parity-time-symmetric architectures, our methodology eliminates symmetry constraints in EP design, significantly expanding the possibilities in non-Hermitian photonic engineering. The proposed technique enables unprecedented control over EP formation and evolution in nanophotonic systems, offering new pathways for developing topological optical devices with enhanced functionality and robustness.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gases to an exponentially expanding universe - The Finsler-Friedmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the invariance of scalar Feynman graphs of any planar topology under the Yangian level-one momentum symmetry given certain constraints on the propagator powers. The proof relies on relating this symmetry to a planarized version of the conformal simplices of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis. In particular, this proves a momentum-space analogue of the position-space conformal condition on propagator powers. When combined with the latter, the invariance under the level-one momentum implies full Yangian symmetry of the considered graphs. These include all scalar Feynman integrals for which a Yangian symmetry was previously demonstrated at the level of examples, e.g. the fishnet or loom graphs, as well as generalizations to graphs with massive propagators.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum state preparation and quantum graphon games.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum information for these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images. Our method builds upon the Rhapsodie framework for polarimetric imaging, substituting its classical prior with a diffusion model trained on synthetic data. Our formulation explicitly incorporates stellar leakage while efficiently handling missing data and high level noise inherent to high-contrast polarimetric imaging. Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying circumstellar environments.</description>
