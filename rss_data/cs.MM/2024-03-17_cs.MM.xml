      <title>Deep Bi-directional Attention Network for Image Super-Resolution Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has emerged a growing interest in exploring efficient quality assessment algorithms for image super-resolution (SR). However, employing deep learning techniques, especially dual-branch algorithms, to automatically evaluate the visual quality of SR images remains challenging. Existing SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics based on two-stream networks lack interactions between branches. To address this, we propose a novel full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) method for SR images. Specifically, producing SR images and evaluating how close the SR images are to the corresponding HR references are separate processes. Based on this consideration, we construct a deep Bi-directional Attention Network (BiAtten-Net) that dynamically deepens visual attention to distortions in both processes, which aligns well with the human visual system (HVS). Experiments on public SR quality databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BiAtten-Net over state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. In addition, the visualization results and ablation study show the effectiveness of bi-directional attention.</description>

      <title>Lost in Overlap: Exploring Watermark Collision in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating content raises concerns about text copyright. Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread use of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks like question answering and paraphrasing. This study focuses on dual watermark collisions, where two watermarks are present simultaneously in the same text. The research demonstrates that watermark collision poses a threat to detection performance for detectors of both upstream and downstream watermark algorithms.</description>

      <title>MR-MT3: Memory Retaining Multi-Track Music Transcription to Mitigate Instrument Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the MT3 model, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) token-based multi-instrument automatic music transcription (AMT) model. Despite SOTA performance, MT3 has the issue of instrument leakage, where transcriptions are fragmented across different instruments. To mitigate this, we propose MR-MT3, with enhancements including a memory retention mechanism, prior token sampling, and token shuffling are proposed. These methods are evaluated on the Slakh2100 dataset, demonstrating improved onset F1 scores and reduced instrument leakage. In addition to the conventional multi-instrument transcription F1 score, new metrics such as the instrument leakage ratio and the instrument detection F1 score are introduced for a more comprehensive assessment of transcription quality. The study also explores the issue of domain overfitting by evaluating MT3 on single-instrument monophonic datasets such as ComMU and NSynth. The findings, along with the source code, are shared to facilitate future work aimed at refining token-based multi-instrument AMT models.</description>

      <title>PAME: Self-Supervised Masked Autoencoder for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically predict the perceptual quality of point clouds without reference, which has achieved remarkable performance due to the utilization of deep learning-based models. However, these data-driven models suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and perform unsatisfactorily in cross-dataset evaluations. To address this problem, we propose a self-supervised pre-training framework using masked autoencoders (PAME) to help the model learn useful representations without labels. Specifically, after projecting point clouds into images, our PAME employs dual-branch autoencoders, reconstructing masked patches from distorted images into the original patches within reference and distorted images. In this manner, the two branches can separately learn content-aware features and distortion-aware features from the projected images. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, the learned content-aware features serve as a guide to fuse the point cloud quality features extracted from different perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art NR-PCQA methods on popular benchmarks in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Pre-Training with Multi-View Fusion for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available reference, which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization of deep neural networks. However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of generalization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain anchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and distortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks. Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing learning-based PCQA models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human-Centered Dynamic Scene Understanding via Multiple LLMs Collaborated Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-centered dynamic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capability of robotic and autonomous systems, in which Video-based Human-Object Interaction (V-HOI) detection is a crucial task in semantic scene understanding, aimed at comprehensively understanding HOI relationships within a video to benefit the behavioral decisions of mobile robots and autonomous driving systems. Although previous V-HOI detection models have made significant strides in accurate detection on specific datasets, they still lack the general reasoning ability like human beings to effectively induce HOI relationships. In this study, we propose V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR), a novel framework consisting of a series of plug-and-play modules that could facilitate the performance of current V-HOI detection models by leveraging the strong reasoning ability of different off-the-shelf pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We design a two-stage collaboration system of different LLMs for the V-HOI task. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme to leverage the LLM conduct reasoning from different aspects. In the second stage, we perform Multi-LLMs Debate to get the final reasoning answer based on the different knowledge in different LLMs. Additionally, we devise an auxiliary training strategy that utilizes CLIP, a large vision-language model to enhance the base V-HOI models' discriminative ability to better cooperate with LLMs. We validate the superiority of our design by demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the prediction accuracy of the base V-HOI model via reasoning from multiple perspectives.</description>

      <title>Magic Tokens: Select Diverse Tokens for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-modal object re-identification (ReID) faces great challenges in maintaining robustness within complex visual scenarios. In contrast, multi-modal object ReID utilizes complementary information from diverse modalities, showing great potentials for practical applications. However, previous methods may be easily affected by irrelevant backgrounds and usually ignore the modality gaps. To address above issues, we propose a novel learning framework named \textbf{EDITOR} to select diverse tokens from vision Transformers for multi-modal object ReID. We begin with a shared vision Transformer to extract tokenized features from different input modalities. Then, we introduce a Spatial-Frequency Token Selection (SFTS) module to adaptively select object-centric tokens with both spatial and frequency information. Afterwards, we employ a Hierarchical Masked Aggregation (HMA) module to facilitate feature interactions within and across modalities. Finally, to further reduce the effect of backgrounds, we propose a Background Consistency Constraint (BCC) and an Object-Centric Feature Refinement (OCFR). They are formulated as two new loss functions, which improve the feature discrimination with background suppression. As a result, our framework can generate more discriminative features for multi-modal object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our methods. The code is available at https://github.com/924973292/EDITOR.</description>

Abstract: The quest for real-time, accurate environmental perception is pivotal in the evolution of autonomous driving technologies. In response to this challenge, we present DyRoNet, a Dynamic Router Network that innovates by incorporating low-rank dynamic routing to enhance streaming perception. DyRoNet distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating a diverse array of specialized pre-trained branch networks, each meticulously fine-tuned for specific environmental contingencies, thus facilitating an optimal balance between response latency and detection precision. Central to DyRoNet's architecture is the Speed Router module, which employs an intelligent routing mechanism to dynamically allocate input data to the most suitable branch network, thereby ensuring enhanced performance adaptability in real-time scenarios. Through comprehensive evaluations, DyRoNet demonstrates superior adaptability and significantly improved performance over existing methods, efficiently catering to a wide variety of environmental conditions and setting new benchmarks in streaming perception accuracy and efficiency. Beyond establishing a paradigm in autonomous driving perception, DyRoNet also offers engineering insights and lays a foundational framework for future advancements in streaming perception.
