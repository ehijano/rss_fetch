      <title>The Goldbach Conjecture as an Informational Economy Principle: A Heuristic Framework from Computational Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic framework for analyzing the Goldbach Conjecture (GC) from the perspective of the physics of information. Through empirical analysis, we propose an Informational Economy Principle (IEP), which posits that differences between prime numbers tend to be resolved by pairs with a minimal sum with over- whelmingly high probability. We argue that this tendency is analogous to least-action principles in physics and is consistent with the fundamental physical limits of computa- tion. Within this framework, the GC can be interpreted as an informational consistency condition for the set of prime numbers. The falsehood of the conjecture would imply a violation of this observed economy, representing an extreme informational anomaly. This approach suggests that the difficulty in proving the GC may not lie solely in math- ematical abstraction, but in the decoupling between said abstraction and the physical constraints inherent to information.</description>

      <title>Is Green Enough? A Remote Sensing Assessment of Environmental Impacts and Green Commitments at Beijing Daxing International Airport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beijing Daxing International Airport has been promoted as a model of green infrastructure under China's ecological modernization agenda. Featuring energy-efficient design, renewable energy systems, and smart environmental controls, the airport embodies multiple green commitments. This study evaluates its environmental outcomes using multi-source remote sensing data -- including NDVI, NDBI, Land Surface Temperature (LST), VIIRS night-time lights, and PM2.5 -- from 2014 to 2019. Through spatial and temporal comparisons, we assess landscape-level changes during and after construction. Findings indicate partial gains from green initiatives but also reveal substantial vegetation loss, increased built-up surfaces, and intensified surface temperatures. The results suggest a gap between sustainable design and ecological impact. We propose a remote-sensing-based framework for evaluating future infrastructure projects, emphasizing the need for spatially explicit, independent monitoring to ensure environmental accountability.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical organization of bursty trains in event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal sequences of discrete events that describe natural and social processes are often driven by non-Poisson dynamics. In addition to a heavy-tailed interevent time distribution, which primarily captures the deviation from a Poisson process, a heavy tail in the distribution of bursty train sizes is frequently observed, which implies the presence of higher-order temporal correlations that extend beyond interevent times. Here, we study empirical event sequences from different domains to show that the bursty trains in these processes are hierarchically structured across different timescales, and that such hierarchical organization gives rise to the higher-order temporal correlations. We propose a dynamic algorithm that generates event sequences with hierarchical structures with arbitrary precision. The algorithm successfully reproduces the features of real-world phenomena, implying the presence of memory mechanisms embedded in system dynamics across multiple timescales.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF) for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will increase interstellar object detection rates to one every few months, substantially elevating the probability of identifying objects with characteristics suggesting artificial origin. Despite this imminent capability, no evidence-based crisis communication framework exists for managing potential technosignature discoveries. We present the Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF), a theoretically grounded protocol that integrates crisis communication theories with the SPECtrum of Rhetoric Intelligences model to address diverse cognitive, social and emotional processing styles. Through analysis of communication failures during COVID-19, Fukushima, and asteroid 99942 Apophis (2004 MN4), we identify critical gaps in managing scientific uncertainty under public scrutiny. The ACF provides graduated protocols calibrated to the Loeb Scale for Interstellar Object Significance, offering specific messaging strategies across four rhetoric intelligence channels (Systematic, Practical, Emotional, Creative) for each evidential level group. Recognizing that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems will mediate public understanding, the framework incorporates safeguards against synthetic media manipulation and algorithmic misinformation through pre-positioned content seeding and deepfake detection protocols. Our theoretical framework reveals that successful communication of paradigm-shifting discoveries requires simultaneous activation of multiple cognitive channels, with messages adapted to cultural contexts and uncertainty levels. This framework provides essential theoretical groundwork for ensuring humanity's potentially most transformative discovery unfolds through understanding rather than chaos.</description>

      <title>Urn Modeling of Random Graphs Across Granularity Scales: A Framework for Origin-Destination Human Mobility Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model human mobility as a combinatorial allocation process, treating trips as distinguishable balls assigned to location-bins and generating origin-destination (OD) networks. From this analogy, we construct a unified three-scale framework, enumerative, probabilistic, and continuum graphon ensembles, and prove a renormalization theorem showing that, in the large sparse regime, these representations converge to a universal mixed-Poisson law. The framework yields compact formulas for key mobility observables, including destination occupancy, vacancy of unvisited sites, coverage (a stopping-time extension of the coupon collector problem), and overflow beyond finite capacities. Simulations with gravity-like kernels, calibrated on empirical OD data, closely match the asymptotic predictions. By connecting exact combinatorial models with continuum analysis, the results offer a principled toolkit for synthetic network generation, congestion assessment, and the design of sustainable urban mobility policies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Innovation: A Statistical Mechanics Framework of Social Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic framework for modeling innovation adoption and abandonment dynamics using statistical mechanics. Starting from a mathematical model for an adoption distribution that fits empirically obtained date, we construct a canonical ensemble whose equilibrium distribution yields Gompertz-like and Maxwell-Boltzmann-like shapes. By reverse engineering the associated energy landscape, we define an effective potential and derive a dynamical Lagrangian formulation. The resulting field theory captures key features of emergent behaviors in socio-technical systems, from early suppression to peak dynamics and late decline. We interpret effective temperature, entropy, and equilibrium points, and show how these systems exhibit hybrid thermodynamic-statistical signatures.</description>

      <title>Modeling Social Systems: Transparency, Reproducibility, and Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of complex social systems can enrich social scientific theory, inform interventions, and shape policy. From voting behavior to economic inequality and urban development, such models influence decisions that affect millions of lives. Thus, it is especially important to formulate and present them with transparency, reproducibility, and humility. Modeling in social domains, however, is often uniquely challenging. Unlike in physics or engineering, researchers often lack controlled experiments or abundant, clean data. Observational data is sparse, noisy, partial, and missing in systematic ways. In such an environment, how can we build models that can inform science and decision-making in transparent and responsible ways?</description>

      <title>A Bibliometric Analysis of the Scholarly Impact of Early Subaru Telescope-based Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bibliometric methods provide valuable tools for assessing scientific productivity and impact across disciplines, yet their application in astronomy journals remains relatively limited. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of Japanese astronomy publications before and after the commissioning of the Subaru Telescope, a major national investment in observational infrastructure. Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we examine peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1996 and 2007 by authors affiliated with Japanese institutions, focusing on field-normalized citation indicators such as the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the share of publications in the top 10% most cited globally. Subaru Telescope-based publications are identified through cross-referencing with official telescope publication lists and are compared against national and global benchmarks. The results show that Subaru Telescope-based publications, while accounting for less than 10% of Japan's total scholarly output in astronomy, consistently achieved FWCI values above 2.0 and a significantly higher proportion of highly cited papers. This indicates that the Subaru Telescope substantially enhanced Japan's research visibility and impact, especially during its early operational years. This study demonstrates the utility of bibliometric evaluation in capturing the academic return of large-scale research facilities and contributes to broader discussions on research infrastructure in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Localized risk perception triggers early behavioral adaptations in epidemics on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contact structure of the population shapes the progression of epidemics. Nonetheless, the joint evolution of individual behavioral adaptations and disease dynamics on networks remains poorly understood. We use a behavioral-epidemiological model to study the joint evolution of human behavior and epidemic dynamics on networks. Our results reveal how the adaptation of local social structures, influenced by risk-benefit trade-offs, affects the dynamics of epidemics. We allow the epidemic and population-level behavior dynamics to emerge from the heterogeneous behavioral responses of individuals. Our framework assumes that individuals adjust their contact structure by temporarily dropping or maintaining connections based on perceived benefits and risks. Our results show that behavioral responses induced by localized risk perceptions lead to premature population-level responses relative to epidemic dynamics. Specifically, individual efforts peak at the epidemic maximum, while population-level efforts remain modest. We explore the robustness and extensions incorporating heterogeneous subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Evaluation and Routing in Public Transport Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both evaluating the service quality of a public transport system and understanding how passengers choose between modes or routes is imperative for public transport operators, providers of competing mobility services and policy makers. However, the literature does not offer consensus on how either of these tasks should be performed, which can lead to inconsistent or counter-intuitive results. This paper provides a formal treatment on how fundamental elements of public transport systems (route sets, timetables and line plans) can be evaluated consistently, and how travelers distribute over routes. Our main insight is that evaluation and routing are two sides of the same coin: by solving an appropriate optimization model one obtains both the quality of the route set, timetable or line plan (the optimal objective value), and the distribution of the travelers over the routes (the optimal solution itself). The practical relevance of the new framework is demonstrated with several applications that are validated with real data from the Dutch and Swiss railway networks. The measures and route choice models developed in this paper enable planners to create better line plans and to effectively analyze timetables for inefficiencies. The framework also reveals: (i) the importance of using the right model for the right stage of planning, (ii) that it is not always necessary for public transport planners to accurately model travel behavior, especially for high-level planning, and (iii) that combining models in an inconsistent way can have significant negative consequences that are avoided with the new framework.</description>
