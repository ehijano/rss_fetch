      <title>HybridOM: Hybrid Physics-Based and Data-Driven Global Ocean Modeling with Efficient Spatial Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global ocean modeling is vital for climate science but struggles to balance computational efficiency with accuracy. Traditional numerical solvers are accurate but computationally expensive, while pure deep learning approaches, though fast, often lack physical consistency and long-term stability. To address this, we introduce HybridOM, a framework integrating a lightweight, differentiable numerical solver as a skeleton to enforce physical laws, with a neural network as the flesh to correct subgrid-scale dynamics. To enable efficient high-resolution modeling, we further introduce a physics-informed regional downscaling mechanism based on flux gating. This design achieves the inference efficiency of AI-based methods while preserving the accuracy and robustness of physical models. Extensive experiments on the GLORYS12V1 and OceanBench dataset validate HybridOM's performance in two distinct regimes: long-term subseasonal-to-seasonal simulation and short-term operational forecasting coupled with the FuXi-2.0 weather model. Results demonstrate that HybridOM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while strictly maintaining physical consistency, offering a robust solution for next-generation ocean digital twins.

      <title>"What is a realistic forecast?" Assessing data-driven weather forecasts, a journey from verification to falsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The artificial intelligence revolution is fueling a paradigm shift in weather forecasting: forecasts are generated with machine learning models trained on large datasets rather than with physics-based numerical models that solve partial differential equations. This new approach proved successful in improving forecast performance as measured with standard verification metrics such as the root mean squared error. At the same time, the realism of data-driven weather forecasts is often questioned and considered as an Achilles' heel of machine learning models. How 'forecast realism' can be defined and how this forecast attribute can be assessed are the two questions simultaneously addressed here. Inspired by the seminal work of Murphy (1993) on the definition of 'forecast goodness', we identify 3 types of realism and discuss methodological paths for their assessment. In this framework, falsification arises as a complementary process to verification and diagnostics when assessing data-driven weather models.</description>

      <title>Radar-Based Raindrop Size Distribution Prediction: Comparing Analytical, Neural Network, and Decision Tree Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of the raindrop size distribution (RSD) is important for applications including quantitative precipitation estimation, soil erosion modelling, and wind turbine blade erosion. While in situ instruments such as disdrometers provide detailed RSD measurements, they are spatially limited, motivating the use of polarimetric radar for remote retrieval of rain microphysical properties. This study presents a comparative evaluation of analytical and machine-learning approaches for retrieving RSD parameters from polarimetric radar observables. One-minute OTT Parsivel2 disdrometer measurements collected between September 2020 and May 2022 at Sheepdrove Farm, UK, were quality-controlled using collocated weighing and tipping-bucket rain gauges. Measured RSDs were fitted to a normalised three-parameter gamma distribution, from which a range of polarimetric radar variables were analytically simulated. Analytical retrievals, neural networks, and decision tree models were then trained to estimate the gamma distribution parameters across multiple radar feature sets and model architectures. To assess robustness and equifinality, each model configuration was trained 100 times using random 70/30 train-test splits, yielding approximately 17,000 trained models in total. Machine-learning approaches generally outperform analytical methods; however, no single model class or architecture is uniformly optimal. Model performance depends strongly on both the target RSD parameter and the available radar observables, with decision trees showing particular robustness in reduced-feature regimes. These results highlight the importance of aligning retrieval model structure with operational data constraints rather than adopting a single universal approach.</description>

      <title>Convolution Based Self Attraction and Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self Attraction and Loading (SAL), which includes the deformation of the solid Earth under the load of the ocean tide and the self-gravitation of the so-deformed Earth as well as of the ocean tides themselves, is an important term to include in numerical models of the ocean tides. Computing SAL is a challenging problem that is usually tackled using spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic approach has several drawbacks which limit its accuracy. In this work, we propose an alternative technique based on a spherical convolution. We implement the convolution technique in the Modular Ocean Model, version 6, and demonstrate that it allows for more accurate tides when measured against tidal datasets based upon satellite altimetry. The convolution based SAL reduces the error by reducing spurious oscillations associated with the Gibbs phenomenon. These oscillations are large in coastal regions under the traditional spherical harmonic approach.</description>

      <title>MSWEP V3: Machine Learning-Powered Global Precipitation Estimates at 0.1$^\circ$ Hourly Resolution (1979-Present)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Version 3 (V3) of the gridded near real-time Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) product -- the first fully global, historical machine learning powered precipitation (P) dataset, developed to meet the growing demand for timely and accurate P estimates amid escalating climate challenges. MSWEP V3 provides hourly data at 0.1$^\circ$ resolution from 1979 to the present, continuously updated with a latency of approximately two hours. Development follows a two-stage process. First, baseline P fields are generated using machine learning model stacks that integrate satellite- and (re)analysis-based P and air-temperature products, along with static variables. The models are trained using hourly and daily observations from 15,959 P gauges worldwide. Second, these baseline P fields are corrected using daily and monthly gauge observations from 57,666 and 86,000 stations globally. To assess MSWEP V3's baseline performance, we evaluated 19 (quasi-) global gridded P products -- including both uncorrected and gauge-based products -- using observations from an independent set of 15,958 gauges excluded from the first training stage. The MSWEP V3 baseline achieved a median daily Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.69, outperforming all evaluated products. Other uncorrected products achieved median daily KGE values of 0.61 (ERA5), 0.46 (IMERG-L V7), 0.38 (GSMaP V8), and 0.31 (CHIRP). Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the daily gauge correction was found to improve the median daily correlation by 0.09, constrained by the already strong baseline performance. We anticipate that MSWEP V3 -- accessible at www.gloh2o.org/mswep -- will enable more reliable monitoring, forecasting, and management of water-related risks in a variable and changing climate.</description>

      <title>Role of the ocean for fast atmospheric evolution revealed by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have recently been many efforts to create machine learnt atmospheric emulators designed to replace physical models. So far these have mainly focused on medium-range weather forecasting, where these `Machine Learnt Weather Prediction' (MLWP) models can outperform leading operational forecasting centres. However, because of this focus on shorter timescales, many of these emulators ignore the effects of the ocean, and take no ocean variables as inputs. We hypothesise that such MLWP models have learnt a best-guess of the evolution of the atmosphere, by implicitly inferring ocean conditions from atmospheric states, with no access to ocean data. Turning this limitation into a strength, we use it as a means to study the role of the oceans on the evolution of the atmosphere. By exploring how model forecast errors relate to properties of the air-sea interface, we infer what ocean information these atmospheric emulators are able to derive from atmospheric data alone, and what they cannot. This highlights the regions and processes through which the ocean independently influences the atmosphere on fast timescales. We perform this analysis for GraphCast, finding clear relationships between air-sea properties and the forecast errors over the ocean, including clear seasonal effects. We then explore what this reveals about GraphCast's internal representation of the ocean. In addition to understanding real-world ocean-atmosphere interactions, this analysis provides guidance for improving forecast skill and physical realism in MLWP models, and for informing how future machine learning models should use ocean information on short timescales.</description>

      <title>WADEPre: A Wavelet-based Decomposition Model for Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting with Multi-Scale Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy-tailed nature of precipitation intensity impedes precise precipitation nowcasting. Standard models that optimize pixel-wise losses are prone to regression-to-the-mean bias, which blurs extreme values. Existing Fourier-based methods also lack the spatial localization needed to resolve transient convective cells. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose WADEPre, a wavelet-based decomposition model for extreme precipitation that transitions the modeling into the wavelet domain. By leveraging the Discrete Wavelet Transform for explicit decomposition, WADEPre employs a dual-branch architecture: an Approximation Network to model stable, low-frequency advection, isolating deterministic trends from statistical bias, and a spatially localized Detail Network to capture high-frequency stochastic convection, resolving transient singularities and preserving sharp boundaries. A subsequent Refiner module then dynamically reconstructs these decoupled multi-scale components into the final high-fidelity forecast. To address optimization instability, we introduce a multi-scale curriculum learning strategy that progressively shifts supervision from coarse scales to fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on the SEVIR and Shanghai Radar datasets demonstrate that WADEPre achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant improvements in capturing extreme thresholds and maintaining structural fidelity. Our code is available at https://github.com/sonderlau/WADEPre.</description>

      <title>Prototype-based Explainable Neural Networks with Channel-specific Reasoning for Geospatial Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for understanding machine learning (ML) decision-making and ensuring model trustworthiness in scientific applications. Prototype-based XAI methods offer an intrinsically interpretable alternative to post-hoc approaches which often yield inconsistent explanations. Prototype-based XAI methods make predictions based on the similarity between inputs and learned prototypes that represent typical characteristics of target classes. However, existing prototype-based models are primarily designed for standard RGB image data and are not optimized for the distinct, variable-specific channels commonly found in geoscientific image and raster datasets. In this study, we develop a prototype-based XAI approach tailored for multi-channel geospatial data, where each channel represents a distinct physical environmental variable or spectral channel. Our approach enables the model to identify separate, channel-specific prototypical characteristics sourced from multiple distinct training examples that inform how these features individually and in combination influence model prediction while achieving comparable performance to standard neural networks. We demonstrate this method through two geoscientific case studies: (1) classification of Madden Julian Oscillation phases using multi-variable climate data and (2) land-use classification from multispectral satellite imagery. This approach produces both local (instance-level) and global (model-level) explanations for providing insights into feature-relevance across channels. By explicitly incorporating channel-prototypes into the prediction process, we discuss how this approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of ML models for geoscientific learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of subgrid scales in long-term simulations of the shallow-water equations using machine learning and convex limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for parametrizing sub-grid processes in the Shallow Water equations. We define coarse variables and local spatial averages and use a feed-forward neural network to learn sub-grid fluxes. Our method results in a local parametrization that uses a four-point computational stencil, which has several advantages over globally coupled parametrizations. We demonstrate numerically that our method improves energy balance in long-term turbulent simulations and also accurately reproduces individual solutions. The neural network parametrization can be easily combined with flux limiting to reduce oscillations near shocks. More importantly, our method provides reliable parametrizations, even in dynamical regimes that are not included in the training data.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence for Wind-Driven Low-Pass Filtering of Infrasound at Short Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound from controlled explosions provide a unique opportunity to isolate atmospheric effects on propagation. We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10-ton TNT-equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single-sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near-unimodal period-distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short-period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind-driven low-pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth-dependent low-pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low-frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein we propose a method to mimic natural processes for the creation of precipitation, in a safe, economically feasible manner anywhere in the world. We propose this is accomplishable via changing the target of the well established field of aerosol dispersal for large scale climate cooling from long term cooling to short term, locally targeted dispersal. We show that such methods could induce precipitation anywhere with sufficient humidity and other conditions, and could be accomplishable at low cost with low or no safety concerns.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion models for downscaling and bias correction of Earth system model precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding. As these events cause severe socioeconomic damage, accurate high-resolution simulation of precipitation is imperative. However, existing Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle to resolve small-scale dynamics and suffer from biases. Traditional statistical bias correction and downscaling methods fall short in improving spatial structure, while recent deep learning methods lack controllability and suffer from unstable training. Here, we propose a machine learning framework for simultaneous bias correction and downscaling. We first map observational and ESM data to a shared embedding space, where both are unbiased towards each other, and then train a conditional diffusion model to reverse the mapping. Only observational data is used for the training, so that the diffusion model can be employed to correct and downscale any ESM field without need for retraining. Our approach ensures statistical fidelity and preserves spatial patterns larger than a chosen spatial correction scale. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing statistical and deep learning methods especially regarding extreme events.</description>
