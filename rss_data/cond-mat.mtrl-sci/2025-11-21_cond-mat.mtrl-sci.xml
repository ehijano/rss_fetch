      <title>Electrical Modulation and Probing of Antiferromagnetism in Hybrid Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique features of ultrafast spin dynamics and the absence of macroscopic magnetization in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials provide a distinct route towards high-speed magnetic storage devices with low energy consumption and high integration density. However, these advantages also introduce challenges in probing and controlling AFM order, thereby restricting their practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate an all-electric control and probing of the AFM order in heavy metal (HM)/AFM insulator (AFMI) heterostructures on a ferroelectric substrate at room temperature (RT). The AFM order was detected by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and manipulated by the ferroelectric field effect as well as the piezoelectric effect in heterostructures of Pt/NiO/0.7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$--0.3PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN--PT). The non-volatile control of AFM order gives rise to a 33\% modulation of AHE, which is further evidenced by synchrotron-based X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). Combined with the $in$-$situ$ piezoelectric response of AHE, we demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization contributes mainly to the control of the AFM order. Our results are expected to have broader implications for efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reorientational Excitations in the Raman Spectrum of Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency Raman peaks, below 250 cm-1, are observed in hydrogen between 2-174 GPa and 13-300 K. The origin of these features is attributed to reorientational transitions (DeltaJ = 0; Q0-branch), which shift from the Rayleigh line as anisotropic intermolecular interactions lift the mJ degeneracy. This family of excitations closely follows the behavior of the S0-branches, sharing their dependence on pressure, temperature, and ortho-H2 concentration. Above 65 K, spectra corrected by the Bose-Einstein population factor reveal a broad continuum arising from populated higher J-states and increased ortho-para disorder. Upon entering phase III, where molecular rotation is inhibited, this continuum is quenched, giving way to well-established optical phonons. Below 25 K, equilibrated samples demonstrate a fine structure from isolated and pair excitations from impurity ortho-H2 molecules in a parahydrogen lattice, the latter a sensitive probe to anisotropic intermolecular interactions relevant to the quantum modeling of solid H2.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Exploration of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys for Strength and Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are compositionally complex materials which have been demonstrated to have the potential for exceptional strength at high operating temperatures. However, their composition space is vast, and other property requirements, such as acceptable plasticity at room-temperature, must be met. Here, we leverage recently published, state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict compressive yield strength at 1,000 {\deg}C and room-temperature plasticity of &gt;100,000 RHEAs. Multiple candidate materials were identified which exhibited exceptional balance between strength and plasticity. Upon experimental synthesis, multiple candidates were proven to outperform any previously reported RHEAs for simultaneous strength and plasticity. Our work demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for rapid materials design, and enables continued multi-property optimization and materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Extending SLUSCHI for Automated Diffusion Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the SLUSCHI package (Solid and Liquid in Ultra Small Coexistence with Hovering Interfaces) to enable automated diffusion calculations from first-principles molecular dynamics. While the original SLUSCHI workflow was designed for melting temperature estimation via solid-liquid coexistence, we adapt its input and output handling to isolate the volume search stage and generate one production trajectory suitable for diffusion analysis. Post-processing tools parse VASP outputs, compute mean-square displacements (MSD), and extract tracer diffusivities using the Einstein relation with robust error estimates through block averaging. Diagnostic plots, including MSD curves, running slopes, and velocity autocorrelations, are produced automatically to help identify diffusive regimes. The method has been validated through representative case studies: self- and inter-diffusion in Al-Cu liquid alloys, sublattice melting in Li_7La_3Zr_2O_12 and Er_2O_3, interstitial oxygen transport in bcc and fcc Fe, and oxygen diffusivity in Fe-O liquids with variable Si and Al contents. Viscosity and diffusivity are linked through the Stokes-Einstein relation, with composition dependence assessed via simple linear mixing. This capability broadens SLUSCHI from melting-point predictions to transport property evaluation, enabling high-throughput, fully first-principles datasets of diffusion coefficients and viscosities across metals and oxides.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the High-Pressure Phases of MAPbBr3 Using a Machine Learning Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure phases of the hybrid perovskite MAPbBr3 have been investigated in detail using a novel machine learning force field (MLFF). MLFF simulations successfully reproduce the sequence of pressure-induced phase transitions from the $\alpha$ ($Pm\bar{3}m$) to the $\beta$ ($Im\bar{3}$) and finally the $\gamma$ ($Pnma$/$Pmn2_1$) phase. In the $\alpha$ phase, the simulations confirm the triple-well character of the potential energy surface for octahedral tilting shedding light into the local dynamic distortions. In the $\beta$ phase, our simulations reveal MA sublattice doubling yielding both orientationally disordered and ordered MA ions mirroring experimental observation. This mixed-order phase results from locally frustrated host-guest couplings arising from the in-phase octahedral tilt system ($a^+a^+a^+$). In the high-pressure $\gamma$ phase, we confirm the formation of polar and anti-polar domains, with the latter have higher lifetimes and persist for over 50 ps at pressures above 1.5 GPa. By elucidating the behavior of various phases of MAPbBr3, this work provides a fundamental understanding of how host-guest interactions and octahedral tilting govern the material's properties. Further, the importance of time scales and length scales in characterizing these phases is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin-Split Magnons in the Metallic Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the collective magnetism of the metallic altermagnet CrSb. Magnetic susceptibility and polarized neutron diffraction measurements show that CrSb is a perfectly compensated Ising altermagnet below a N\'eel temperature of $T_N = 733(4)$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments reveal anisotropic and highly-dispersive antiferromagnetic spin waves with velocities of 61(2) km s$^{-1}$ and 58(2) km s$^{-1}$ along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. The observed magnon dispersions along high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone are well described by a minimal Heisenberg model up to third nearest neighbors of alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic character, $J_1 = 23(4)$ meV, $J_2 = -5.4(8)$ meV, $J_3 = 5.2(8)$ meV, and an Ising single-ion anisotropy term $D = 0.15(4)$ meV. We observe clear signatures of chiral spin splitting along the low-symmetry $\Gamma$-$L$ direction, characteristic of higher-order altermagnetic exchange interactions, the first such observation in a metallic altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and optical characterization of Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystalline thin films prepared via chemical bath deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manganese-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystalline thin films were synthesized using a low-temperature chemical bath deposition and deposited on glass substrates for controlled durations using triethanolamine (TEA) as a complexing and capping agent. After deposition, the films were annealed at 200 degrees Celsius and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline cubic zinc blende ZnS with an average crystallite size of approximately 37 nm. Optical measurements revealed strong transparency in the visible region, blue-shifted absorption edges due to quantum confinement, and a band gap value of approximately 3.70 eV. Mn incorporation resulted in a slight red shift of the absorption edge, attributed to particle growth and sp-d exchange interactions. These results demonstrate that Mn doping modifies the optical response of ZnS while preserving its crystalline structure, suggesting its suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Following the Long-Term Evolution of sp$^3$-type Defects in Tritiated Graphene using Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the evolution of tritium-induced sp$^3$-defects in monolayer graphene on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, by comparing large-area Raman maps of the same two samples, acquired just after fabrication and twice thereafter, about 9-12 months apart. Inbetween measurements the samples were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Using a conservative classification of sp$^3$-type spectra, based on the D/D' peak intensity ratio, we observed almost complete depletion of sp$^3$-type defects over the investigation period of about two years. This by far exceeds the ~5.5% annual reduction expected from tritium decay alone (~3x larger). This change in the defect composition is accompanied by a recovery of the 2D-band of graphene and an overall decrease in defect-density, as determined via the D/G intensity ratio. Hydogenated graphene is reported to be reasonably stable over several months, when kept under vacuum, but suffers substantial hydrogen loss under laboratory air conditions. While the results shown here for tritiated graphene exhibit similarities with hydrogenated graphene, however, some distinct differences are observed.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Freestanding Fluoropolymer Films for Advanced Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable transfer of insulating films onto semiconductor or metal surfaces is vital for enabling damage-free integration, especially where direct deposition is difficult or surface sensitivity to the growth environment degrades interface quality. However, insulating materials that are both easily transferable, scalable and capable of withstanding high electric fields remain limited, and the search for such materials has attracted significant attention. Herein, a distinct and robust method is demonstrated for damage-free transfer of freestanding fluoropolymer insulating films onto a wide range of substrates including low-adhesion surfaces such as hydrogen-terminated diamond. Water-soluble sacrificial layer allows the exfoliation of fluoropolymer films with peripheral support, enabling their transfer as uniform freestanding films, which exhibit root-mean-square roughness of $0.45 {\pm} 0.03$ nm. These films reveal high breakdown fields exceeding $7$ MV cm$^{-1}$, with leakage current density remaining below ${10}^{-8}$ A cm$^{-2}$ before the breakdown. The incorporation of these fluoropolymer films as gate dielectrics in p-channel hydrogen-terminated diamond field-effect transistors results in transfer and output characteristics with negligible hysteresis, enhanced channel mobility (${\approx}400$ cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and a low interface trap density (${\le}3{\times}10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$eV$^{-1}$). These findings highlight the versatility of the transfer method and establish freestanding fluoropolymers as a practical alternative to deposited dielectrics for forming high-quality dielectric/semiconductor interfaces for advanced electronics.</description>

      <title>Prediction of atomic H adsorption energies in metalloid doped MSSe (M = Mo/W) Janus layers: A combined DFT and machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Janus derivatives of 2H MX2 (M = Mo/W; X = S/Se), namely MSSe, have already been experimentally realized and explored for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and optoelectronics. Focusing on the photocatalytic properties of these layers, we investigate the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the MSSe layers in the presence of metalloid dopants B, Si, and Ge. The layers in their pristine form exhibit positive adsorption energies, indicating an endothermic nature. Substitution of a dopant in the pristine MSSe layers alters the local symmetry, bonding character, and charge distribution, thereby increasing the number of active sites for hosting H adsorption and reducing the adsorption energy. We select distinct sites, both atomic and interstitial, for the substitution of dopants. The energetics of the H atom at various sites is studied to find the most favorable active site on the MSSe Janus layers. Our results based on density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption process becomes spontaneous and less attractive in the presence of atomic site dopant substitution, whereas the interstitial site results in an endothermic behavior. Moreover, having the data from DFT, we develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the hydrogen adsorption energy. For this purpose, we utilize 23 elemental features of the atoms involved in the structure, thereby eliminating the need for DFT calculations in feature design. The dimensionality reduction technique, principal component analysis, is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, yielding independent features that are mutually orthogonal. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron regressor with two hidden layers. The data augmentation technique is employed to artificially expand the dataset size, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the neural network model by 0.90% on the testing data.</description>

      <title>van der Waals epitaxy of lead monoxide - PbO and application as a virtual substrate for oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of epitaxial layers of van der Waals (vdW) lead oxide (PbO) polymorphs on different substrates, via pulsed laser deposition. A thin layer of vdW ${\alpha}$-PbO (~5 nm) was subsequently used as a virtual substrate to grow thin films of perovskites BaTiO$_3$, SrTiO$_3$, and the spinel CoFe$_2$O$_4$ with a crystal quality comparable to direct epitaxy on single-crystal oxide substrates. Notably, films with the larger lattice parameter underwent spontaneous, controlled spalling within days of growth, remaining structurally intact, or were easily exfoliated and transferred using the tape method. This work establishes PbO as a promising virtual substrate technology for the fabrication of free-standing oxide membranes through vdW epitaxy, offering advantages over conventional sacrificial layer methods.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle states of hexagonal BN: A van der Waals density functional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute and track the impact of truly nonlocal-correlation effects on the quasi-particle (QP) band-structure of hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) systems. To that end, we start with the consistent-exchange vdW-DF-cx version [PRB 89, 035412 (2014)] of the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method [JPCM 39, 390001 (2020)] for exchange-correlation (XC) functional design and enforce piece-wise linearity in the energy changes with partial charging, using the Koopmans-integer (KI) DFT framework [JCTC 19, 7079 (2023)]. Our approach and results (denoted KI-CX) extends present-standard use of KI DFT (denoted KI-PBE as it is based on the semilocal PBE [PRL 77, 3865 (1996)] XC functional) to capture, for example, the impact of the interlayer coupling on the QPs. We contrast KI-CX and KI-PBE results for the QP band-structure and compare with both $GW$ calculations and experimental observations of the (direct and indirect) QP gaps. We find that KI-CX brings improvements in the h-BN QP energy description and generally agrees with $GW$ studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Phase Transformations in Alloying Anodes via In-Situ Liquid Cell Hard X-ray Spectroscopy and Cryogenic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding electrochemical phenomena at complex liquid solid interfaces requires linking real time structural dynamics with atomic scale interfacial chemistry. Here, we integrate operando synchrotron X-ray fluorescence and diffraction with high resolution cryogenic electron and ion multi model microscopy to provide a mechanistic understanding of Pt based alloying anodes across length scales. We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability. Our findings demonstrate a broadly applicable correlative framework bridging operando structural dynamics with near atomic resolution interfacial chemistry, advancing the rational design of durable alloy electrodes for next generation energy storage.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are a class of collinear magnets that exhibit non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands in the absence of net magnetization. Their potential to generate large spin polarization without spin-orbit coupling has created strong interest in probes that access the underlying order parameter directly. In this Perspective, we show that linear magneto-birefringence (LMB) provides a natural and broadly applicable route to detecting altermagnetic order. Building on the correspondence between the momentum-space structure of NRSS and the ferroic ordering of magnetic multipoles in real space, we demonstrate how $d$-wave and $g$-wave NRSS textures yield distinct LMB responses. We present a symmetry-based framework that identifies the optical geometries and field configurations required to isolate specific multipole components, enabling domain imaging and providing benchmarks for theoretical models of LMB.</description>

      <title>The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the discovery of high plasticity in ternary germanium-based single-crystal GaGeTe, which breaks through the inherent brittleness of traditional binary germanium-based chalcogenides and fills a research gap in germanium-based plastic semiconductors. Combining spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy experiments with density functional theory calculations, the study reveals a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip. These findings provide fresh insight into the plastic behavior of inorganic semiconductors and clarifies the critical role of intralayer structural evolution in plastic behavior. This work not only expands the family of plastic semiconductor materials but also provides a new theoretical basis and candidate platform for the material design of flexible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Bi$_2$O$_3$--Fe$_2$O$_3$ Phase Diagram to Tailor BiFeO$_3$ Structure and Dielectric Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth ferrite ($BiFeO_3$, BFO) is a promising multiferroic oxide whose practical utilisation is limited by secondary-phase formation and defect-driven electrical inhomogeneity within the $Bi_2O_3$-$Fe_2O_3$ system. In this work, BFO was synthesised via solid-state reaction using 55:45 and 70:30 (mol%) of $Bi_2O_3$ $\colon$ $Fe_2O_3$ precursors sintered between 700$^O$C and 800$^\circ$C, and characterised through X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and impedance spectroscopy. A refined phase diagram identifies the onset of liquid-phase formation near 835$^O$C, delineating a narrow thermal window for phase-pure BFO. The 55:45 composition evolves toward rhombohedral $R3c$ symmetry with lattice contraction, suppression of Sillenite- and Mullite-type impurities, and markedly reduced vibrational disorder, yielding homogeneous grains with near-Debye dielectric relaxation ($n &gt; 0.9$), low CPE prefactors, and a four-orders-of-magnitude increase in bulk AC conductivity upon sintering at 775$^\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-rich 70:30 samples retain expanded lattice volumes, defective grain boundaries, and highly depressed Nyquist arcs ($n &lt; 0.5$), reflecting persistent structural disorder and stabilisation of insulating secondary phases. The convergence of structural, microstructural, and impedance signatures identifies the 55:45 precursor sintered at 775$^\circ$C as the optimal condition within the studied range, establishing a clear structure-property relationship that enables controlled synthesis and reliable dielectric performance in BFO-based multiferroic applications.</description>

      <title>Li-P-S Electrolyte Materials as a Benchmark for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for materials simulations, there is an increasing demand for robust, automated, and chemically insightful benchmarking methodologies. In response, we here introduce LiPS-25, a curated benchmark dataset for a canonical series of solid-state electrolyte materials from the Li2S-P2S5 pseudo-binary compositional line, including crystalline and amorphous configurations. Together with the dataset, we present a suite of performance tests that range from conventional numerical error metrics to physically motivated evaluation tasks. With a focus on graph-based MLIP architectures, we run numerical experiments that assess (i) the effect of hyperparameters and (ii) the fine-tuning behavior of selected pre-trained ("foundational") MLIP models. Beyond the Li-P-S solid-state electrolytes, we expect that such benchmarks and their code implementations can be readily adapted to other material systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing Phonon Bridge Effect for Amorphous vs Crystalline Metal-Silicide Layers at Si/Ti Interfaces by a Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-semiconductor interfaces play a central role in micro and nano-electronic devices as heat dissipation or temperature drop across these interfaces can significantly affect device performance. Prediction of accurate thermal boundary resistance (TBR) across these interfaces, considering realistic structures and their correlation with underlying thermal transport, remains challenging. In this work we develop a unified Neuroevolution Potential (NEP) for the Si-Ti system that accurately reproduces energies, forces, and phonon properties of bulk Si, Ti, and TiSi2 and extends naturally to interfacial environments to analyze interfacial transport. An important development over current machine-learned interatomic potentials is the capability to model complex structures at metal-semiconductor interfaces, as the NEP enables large scale non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of epitaxial Si/Ti interfaces to elucidate the effect of amorphous or crystalline silicide interfacial layers. Simulated TBRs show excellent agreement with our time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements. Spectral analyses reveal that amorphous TiSi2 interfacial layer helps in efficient interfacial transport when the thickness is less than 1.5 nm compared to the crystalline TiSi2 layer, but this trend reverses when the interfacial layer thickness increases beyond 1.5 nm. Comparison of TBRs at Si/TiSi2 interface for different crystalline phases of TiSi2 establishes that C54 phase has reduced TBR compared to C49 phase, which is correlated with the difference in their phonon density of states (PDOS) overlap with Si. These results provide atomistic insight into the role of crystalline versus amorphous silicides in interfacial heat transport and demonstrate a transferable machine-learned potential for studying heat dissipation in advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Process Microstructure Coupling in Reduced Gravity Laser Welding via Open-Source Multiphysics Simulation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supplying spare parts from Earth for in space repair is economically prohibitive and logistically slow, posing a major barrier to sustainable space operations. As lunar and Martian missions accelerate in the coming decades, the feasibility of in-situ repair methods, particularly laser based welding, must be rigorously evaluated. The micro scale physics governing weld quality are fundamentally altered by variations in gravity and ambient pressure, yet their coupled influence across different welding regimes remains poorly understood. This work introduces a fully open-source thermo-fluid-microstructure modeling framework with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA) to quantify how gravitational conditions reshape weld pool behavior across multiple welding regimes and spatial scales. The framework further enables prediction of the resulting microstructure from imposed process parameters, providing an accessible pathway for future research in in space manufacturing (ISM). As a demonstration, the article analyzes laser welding of Al6061 across three process regimes (conduction, transition, and keyhole) and four gravitational environments (Earth, Moon, Mars, and International Space Station (ISS)). Analysis reveals that reduced gravity suppresses buoyancy-driven convection, thereby altering melt pool geometries. Vacuum conditions increase laser energy deposition, while microgravity promotes equiaxed grain formation via reduced melt convection. The framework captures keyhole dynamics, thermal histories, and grain morphologies with high fidelity, validated against experimental data. These findings establish process microstructure relationships critical for reliable metallic fabrication in space and provide a reproducible platform for future in-space manufacturing research.</description>

      <title>Exciton and trion formation in systems with van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of van-Hove singularities (VHS) in a system's electronic band structure on the formation and properties of excitons and trions. We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Bi-Pd/Pt systems have attracted a lot of interest because of their topologically non-trivial nature along with superconductivity. We report the structural and superconducting properties of high-quality single-crystalline BiPt using a comprehensive range of experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, muon spin rotation/relaxation ({\mu}SR), magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity. Our findings establish that BiPt is a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.2 K which exhibits pronounced anisotropic superconducting characteristics attributed to its hexagonal crystal structure. Magnetization and electronic transport studies reveal that BiPt lies within the dirty limit, while {\mu}SR and heat capacity data indicate conventional s-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry. This work provides valuable insights into the pairing symmetry and superconducting mechanism of topologically trivial BiPt, a sound comparison system for other Bi-based topologically nontrivial superconductors.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionium meta-matter: a topologically heterogeneous magnetic crystal with emergent hybrid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a new class of topological magnetic textures, skyrmionium meta-matter, composed of skyrmioniums (Skm, $Q=0$) and skyrmions (Sk, $Q=-1$) arranged in periodic lattices mimicking the richness of atomic materials. Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological "pins" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Nature of 2D XY antiferromagnetism in a van der Waals monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnetism has long attracted significant interest in many areas of condensed matter physics, but only recently has experimental exploration become feasible due to the isolation of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers. Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental observations of many interaction-driven electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices have stimulated intense theoretical and experimental efforts to understand and engineer these correlated physics. Strain is a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling the geometrical and electronic structures of moir\'e superlattices. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the geometry of strained moir\'e superlattices. First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moir\'e materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moir\'e geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moir\'e geometries realized via these approaches. This review aims at equipping the reader with a robust understanding on the description and implementation of strain in moir\'e materials, as well as highlight some major breakthroughs in this active field.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Controlled Ultrastrong Phonon-Photon Coupling in a Terahertz Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.</description>

      <title>From Patents to Dataset: Scraping for Oxide Glass Compositions and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.</description>

      <title>Efficient and affordable thermoelectric measurement setup using Arduino and LabVIEW for education and research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, making them promising candidates for harvesting waste heat, an increasingly important challenge in the energy-intensive modern world. The search for improved thermoelectric materials is therefore an active area of research in materials physics. Despite their fundamental and practical significance, thermoelectric properties - such as the Seebeck coefficient and power factor - are rarely explored in student labs due to the complexity in measurement schemes and requirement for sophisticated equipment. In this work, we present a user-friendly, low-cost and efficient thermoelectric measurement system built with Arduino and LabVIEW, which can simultaneously measure Seebeck coefficients and power factors as a function of temperature. This was made possible by improving the resolution of Arduino over ~1000 times with amplifiers and noise reduction schemes. With a total cost of only ~$100 and simple measurement protocols, this setup is well suited not only for student labs but also for efficient thermoelectric research.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Ne\'el order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials can offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods we present ML-MIX, a CPU- and GPU-compatible LAMMPS package to accelerate simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities allowing deployment of modern MLIPs even under restricted computational budgets. We demonstrate our method for ACE, UF3, SNAP and MACE potential architectures and demonstrate how linear 'cheap' potentials can be distilled from a given 'expensive' potential, allowing close matching in relevant regions of configuration space. The functionality of ML-MIX is demonstrated through tests on point defects in Si, Fe and W-He, in which speedups of up to 11x over ~ 8,000 atoms are demonstrated, without sacrificing accuracy. The scientific potential of ML-MIX is demonstrated via two case studies in W, measuring the mobility of b = 1/2 111 screw dislocations with ACE/ACE mixing and the implantation of He with MACE/SNAP mixing. The latter returns He reflection coefficients which (for the first time) match experimental observations up to an He incident energy of 80 eV - demonstrating the benefits of deploying state-of-the-art models on large, realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Theory of Phonon Magnetic Moment Induced by Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magnetic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of an approach to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in realistic materials. Here, based on the linear response framework, we develop an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Our method can precisely calculate phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals with significant EPC, as demonstrated by the remarkable agreement with recent experimental observations of phonon Zeeman splitting in the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2. In addition, the long-sought magnetic phonon spectra across the entire Brillouin zone are obtained, facilitating the study of magnetic phonon transport and topology. Specifically, by constructing an inertially decoupled lattice model, we propose candidate materials exhibiting intrinsic phonon Chern states with robust unidirectional edge phonon currents. Our work paves the way for investigating novel phonon phenomena in magnetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>First-principles prediction of altermagnetism in transition metal graphite intercalation compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, {which persists at finite temperature}. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon interaction and lattice thermal conductivity from metals to 2D Dirac crystals: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>

Abstract: Metal hydrides can be tuned to have a diverse range of properties and find applications in hydrogen storage and superconductivity. Finding methods to control the synthesis of hydrides can open up new pathways to unlock novel hydride compounds with desired properties. We introduced the idea of utilizing electrochemistry as an additional tuning knob and in this work, we study the synthesis of binary metal hydrides using high pressure, electrochemistry and combined pressure-electrochemistry. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the phase diagrams of selected transition metal hydrides under combined pressure and electrochemical conditions and demonstrate that the approach agrees well with experimental observations for most phases. We use the phase diagrams to determine trends in the stability of binary metal hydrides of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum as well as discuss the hydrogen-metal charge transfer at different pressures. Furthermore, we predict a diverse range of vanadium and chromium hydrides that could potentially be synthesized using pressure electrochemistry. These predictions highlight the value of exploring pressure-electrochemistry as a pathway to novel hydride synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the intrinsic nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect (NPTHE)-- a dissipationless thermal response proportional to $(\nabla T)^2B$, which arises when the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ lie within the same plane. The effect originates from a thermal gradient induced correction to the Berry curvature, characterized by the thermal Berry connection polarizability (TBCP) tensor, leading to a nonlinear transverse heat current independent of scattering time. A symmetry analysis shows that the intrinsic NPTHE is permitted only in noncentrosymmetric crystal point groups lacking horizontal mirror symmetry. Using a tilted Dirac model, we demonstrate that its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective means to control the nonlinear thermal response. Our results establish a new class of quantum geometry driven intrinsic nonlinear thermal transport, offering both a sensitive probe of band geometry and a pathway toward nonlinear thermal functionalities in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We hybridize the swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation methods to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of the lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. However, ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. Most Nb ions collapse into a single percolating cluster with a mesh-like structure. This specific geometry serves to prevent large space charges, and this behavior differs from typical phase separation in metallic alloys. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function that is consistent with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric properties of PMN.</description>

      <title>Variationally Consistent Framework for Finite-Strain Microelasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its reality has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density ( &gt; 10^9 A/m^2) including EM mass drivers such as railguns with liquid metal sliding contacts, flux compression generators and also high energy plasmas including fusion and other energy technologies. The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a supported copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE-Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the total current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique is described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of, and discrimination between, axial mechanical contact forces between solid and liquid metal as well as longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Amp\`ere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) enable subwavelength light control for infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronics, but conventional polar materials have narrow Reststrahlen bands, limiting applications. Materials that support PhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor are therefore needed. Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes possess the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nm-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 x 10-5c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as versatile platforms for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interactions and suggests a strategy to boost its magnitude by harnessing band structure hot spots associated with orbital degeneracy.</description>
