      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in Anisotropic Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose shortcut to adiabaticity protocols for Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in generalized anisotropic harmonic traps in three dimensions. These protocols enable high-fidelity tuning of trap geometries on time scales much faster than those required for adiabatic processes and are robust across a wide range of interaction strengths, from weakly interacting regimes to the Thomas-Fermi limit. Using the same approach, we also design STA paths to rapidly drive interaction strengths in both isotropic and anisotropic traps. Comparisons with standard linear ramps of system parameters demonstrate significant improvements in performance. Finally, we apply these STA techniques to a unitary engine cycle with a BEC as the working medium. The STA methods significantly enhance the engine's power output without reducing efficiency and remain highly effective even after multiple consecutive cycles.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a binary quantum fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the "ripplon" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Transition to strong wave turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically wave turbulence in a Bose-Einstein condensate in the forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate is increased, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave turbulence Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterised by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increase leads to emergence of a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogolyubov-type acoustic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Operator Valued Flow Equation Approach to the Bosonic Lattice Polaron: Dispersion Renormalization Beyond the Fr\"ohlich Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ground state properties of a lattice Bose polaron, a quasiparticle arising from the interaction between an impurity confined to an optical lattice and a surrounding homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate hosting phononic modes. We present an extension of Wegner's and Wilson's flow equation approach, the operator valued flow equation approach, which allows us to calculate the renormalized dispersion of the polaron and assess the role of two-phonon scattering processes on the dispersion. The results obtained in this way are compared to a variational mean-field approach. We find that in certain impurity phonon interaction regimes the shape of the dispersion is significantly altered by the inclusion of two-phonon scattering events as opposed to only single-phonon scattering events. Moreover, our results predict that a polaronic bound state may emerge, which is not present in Fr\"ohlich-type models that only consider single-phonon scattering events.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws Governing the Collapse of a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collapse of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate, where an unstable system evolves towards a singularity, by numerically solving the underlying cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find good agreement between our simulations and the atom-loss measurements with a $^{39}$K condensate. Our simulations reveal an interplay of weak collapse and the propensity of the system to form a hotspot, and we uncover new scaling laws that govern this behavior. We also identify promising signatures of the theoretically predicted, but so far experimentally elusive, elastic three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>On polarons and dimerons in the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional spin-up ideal Fermi gas interacting attractively with a spin-down impurity in the continuum undergoes, at zero temperature, a first-order phase transition from a polaron to a dimeron state. Here we study a similar system on a square lattice, by considering the attractive 2D Fermi-Hubbard model with a single spin-down and a finite filling fraction of spin-up fermions. We study polaron and dimeron quasi-particle properties via variational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation. Moreover, we develop a determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm for this problem based on expansion in bare on-site coupling $U$. This algorithm turns out to be sign-problem free at any filling of spin-up fermions, allowing one to sample very high diagram order (larger than $200$ in our study) and to do simulations for large $U/t$ (we go up to $U/t=-20$ with $t$ the hopping strength). Both methods give qualitatively consistent results. With variational Ansatz we go to even larger on-site attraction. In contrast with the continuum case, we do not observe any polaron-to-dimeron transition for a range of spin-up filling fractions $\rho_{\uparrow}$ between $0.1$ and $0.4$. % (away from the low-filling limit). The polaron state always gives a lower energy and has a finite quasi-particle residue.</description>

      <title>Quantum frustrated Wigner chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Loss induced collective mode in one-dimensional Bose gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two-body losses induce a collective excitation in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas, even in the absence of a quench in the trap or any other external perturbation. Focusing on the dissipatively fermionized regime, we perform an exact mode expansion of the rapidity distribution function and characterize the emergence of the collective motion. We find clear coherent oscillations in the widths of the gas both in position and rapidity space as well as in the phase space quadrupole mode of the gas. We compare this motion to that of the well known breathing mode in the absence of losses and find that they differ in the motion of the density profile. We also discuss the role of losses in the collective motion of the gas following various other protocols, such as the removal of losses after a finite hold time, and when the harmonic trap is also quenched.</description>

      <title>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha&gt;1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, enables efficient numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the specific way in which the entire system is divided into multiple equally sized finite clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We further compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those from a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in the short-time region, where the energy conservation is well maintained in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it has the potential for application to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive theoretical model for the interaction strength between a pair of exciton-polaritons in microcavity devices. Ab initio numerical calculations for dipolar polaritons in one dimension are used as a starting point to build a Born-Oppenheimer theory that generally applies to generic -- dipolar or non-dipolar polaritons -- in both one and two dimensions. This theory anticipates that the strong coupling to the cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons, and predicts unexpected scaling laws in the interaction strength as a function of system parameters. Comparisons with available experimental data are drawn, and specific suggestions to validate it with new experiments are made. Promising strategies towards the observation of a strong polariton blockade regime are finally sketched.</description>

      <title>Synthetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories based on parametric excitations of trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed scheme for the analog quantum simulation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories in crystals of trapped ions, which exploits a more efficient hybrid encoding of the gauge and matter fields using the native internal and motional degrees of freedom. We introduce a versatile toolbox based on parametric excitations corresponding to different spin-motion-coupling schemes that induce a tunneling of the ions vibrational excitations conditioned to their internal qubit state. This building block, when implemented with a single trapped ion, corresponds to a minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, where the qubit plays the role of the gauge field on a synthetic link, and the vibrational excitations along different trap axes mimic the dynamical matter fields two synthetic sites, each carrying a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge. To evaluate their feasibility, we perform numerical simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to generalise this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number of ions, moving from a single link to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ plaquette, and to an entire $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain. We present analytical expressions for the gauge-invariant dynamics and the corresponding confinement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state simulations.</description>

      <title>Localization in two-dimensional fermions with arbitrary pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, naturally generalizing the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of two-dimensional free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-$s$. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions and exploit their curious mathematical connection to Pascal's triangle to evaluate relevant quantities such as scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when the Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for integer (half-integer) $s$, irrespective of the band index. Remarkably, the localization corrections increase with $s$, but the relative localization corrections are found to decrease with $s$, i.e., faster-moving relativistic electrons are less susceptible to disorder effects. Coupled with our elementary analysis on electron-electron interactions, this sheds insights on Anderson and many-body localization in these materials.</description>
