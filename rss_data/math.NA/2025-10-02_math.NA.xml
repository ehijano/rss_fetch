      <title>Asymptotically compatible entropy-consistent discretization for a class of nonlocal conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws modeling traffic flows, given by $ \partial_t \rho_\varepsilon + \partial_x(V(\rho_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon) \rho_\varepsilon) = 0 $ with a suitable convex kernel $ \gamma_\varepsilon $, and its Godunov-type numerical discretization. We prove that, as the nonlocal parameter $ \varepsilon $ and mesh size $ h $ tend to zero simultaneously, the discrete approximation $ W_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $ W_\varepsilon := \rho_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon $ converges to the entropy solution of the (local) scalar conservation law $ \partial_t \rho + \partial_x(V(\rho) \rho) = 0 $, with an explicit convergence rate estimate of order $ \varepsilon+h+\sqrt{\varepsilon\, t}+\sqrt{h\,t} $. In particular, with an exponential kernel, we establish the same convergence result for the discrete approximation $ \rho_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $ \rho_\varepsilon $, along with an $ \mathrm{L}^1 $-contraction property for $ W_\varepsilon $. The key ingredients in proving these results are uniform $ \mathrm{L}^\infty $- and $\mathrm{TV}$-estimates that ensure compactness of approximate solutions, and discrete entropy inequalities that ensure the entropy admissibility of the limit solution.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of 2D Navier--Stokes equations with nonsmooth initial value in the critical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the numerical solution of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes (NS) equations with nonsmooth initial data in the $L^2$ space, which is the critical space for the two-dimensional NS equations to be well-posed. In this case, the solutions of the NS equations exhibit certain singularities at $t=0$, e.g., the $H^s$ norm of the solution blows up as $t\rightarrow 0$ when $s&gt;0$. To date, the best convergence result proved in the literature are first-order accuracy in both time and space for the semi-implicit Euler time-stepping scheme and divergence-free finite elements (even high-order finite elements are used), while numerical results demonstrate that second-order convergence in time and space may be achieved. Therefore, there is still a gap between numerical analysis and numerical computation for the NS equations with $L^2$ initial data. The primary challenge to realizing high-order convergence is the insufficient regularity in the solutions due to the rough initial condition and the nonlinearity of the equations. In this work, we propose a fully discrete numerical scheme that utilizes the Taylor--Hood or Stokes-MINI finite element method for spatial discretization and an implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta time-stepping method in conjunction with graded stepsizes. By employing discrete semigroup techniques, sharp regularity estimates, negative norm estimates and the $L^2$ projection onto the divergence-free Raviart--Thomas element space, we prove that the proposed scheme attains second-order convergence in both space and time. Numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical analysis. In particular, the convergence in space is at most second order even higher-order finite elements are used. This shows the sharpness of the convergence order proved in this article.</description>

      <title>A multi-resolution limiter for the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-resolution (MR) limiter for the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws on a general unstructured mesh. Unlike classical limiters, which detects only solution discontinuities to dichotomize cells into good or troubled, the proposed MR limiter also takes into account the derivative discontinuities to divide cells into several groups. The method operates by performing a successive comparison of the local DG polynomial's derivatives, from high-order to low-order, against a baseline constructed from neighboring cell averages. If a $k$th-order derivative of the DG polynomial is larger than the baseline,
  then we reduce the order to $k-1$ and set the corresponding $k$th-order terms to be 0; Otherwise, the remaining $k$th-order DG polynomial is used to represent the final solution. Only if all the derivatives are larger than the baseline, a TVD slope limiter is used to reconstruct the solution. In this manner, the limiter dynamically selects an optimal polynomial suited to the local solution smoothness without problem-dependent parameter to tune. Notably, it also possesses a scale-invariance property that is absent in most classical limiters. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed MR limiter.</description>

      <title>Time-marching multi-level variational multiscale tensor decomposition algorithm for heat conduction with moving heat source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a time-marching multi-level Variational Multiscale-Tensor Decomposition (VMS-TD) algorithm to solve the heat equation with a moving heat source model that arises from additive manufacturing. First, we take a second-order centered difference for time semi-discretization. The temperature field is decomposed according to multiple space resolution levels, each represented by the TD method. Then we adopt the VMS formulation [T.J.R. Hughes, G.R. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.B. Quincy. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 166:3-24 (1998)] for the resulting elliptic problem to obtain a Galerkin weak form, and design VMS-TD algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, to comply with the TD solution scheme, special inter-scale data transfers are made at the scale interface and moving fine-scale subdomains. Numerical results demonstrate that the multi-level VMS-TD algorithm is much more efficient than the fully resolved TD algorithm, let alone traditional direct numerical simulation methods such as finite difference or finite element analysis. Compared with the well-known multi-grid methods or more recent GO-MELT framework [J.P. Leonor, G.J. Wagner. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg, 426:116977 (2024)], the three-level VMS-TD uses much smaller degrees of freedom to reach accurate results. A multi-time-scale extension of VMS-TD algorithm is also proposed.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Finite Element Method for Shape Reconstruction of Inverse Conductivity Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse conductivity problem aims at determining the unknown conductivity inside a bounded domain from boundary measurements. In practical applications, algorithms based on minimizing a regularized residual functional subject to PDE constraints have been widely used to deal with this problem. However, such approaches typically require repeated iterations and solving the forward problem at each iteration, which leads to a heavy computational cost. To address this issue, we first reformulate the inverse conductivity problem as a minimization problem involving a regularized residual functional. We then transform this minimization problem into a variational problem and establish the equivalence between them. This reformulation enables the employment of the finite element method to reconstruct the shape of the object from finitely many measurements. Notably, the proposed approach allows us to identify the object directly without requiring any iterative procedure. {\it A prior} error estimates are rigorously established to demonstrate the theoretical soundness of the finite element method. Based on these estimates, we provide a criterion for selecting the regularization parameter. Additionally, several numerical examples are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach in shape reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Symbolic and High-Accuracy Solutions to Differential and Integral Problems via a Novel Recursive Inverse Laplace Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-analytical method for solving a broad class of initial value problems involving differential, integro-differential, and delay equations, including those with fractional and variable-order derivatives. The proposed approach is based on the inverse Laplace transform, applied initially - unlike traditional Laplace-based techniques which begin with a forward transformation. By assuming the unknown solution is the Laplace transform of an auxiliary function, the method reformulates the problem in the time domain and recursively solves for this function using symbolic operations. The final solution is then obtained by applying the Laplace transform to the result. This strategy enables the construction of symbolic solutions as generalized logarithmic-power series with arbitrary accuracy, and naturally accommodates complex terms. The method is highly versatile and demonstrates superior speed and precision across a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems, including singular, fractional, and chaotic systems. Several benchmark examples are provided to validate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed technique compared to classical numerical methods. The results confirm that the new method offers a powerful and flexible framework for symbolic computation of initial value problems.</description>

      <title>Carleman Linearization of Parabolic PDEs: Well-posedness, convergence, and efficient numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the analysis of the Carleman linearization can be extended to dynamical systems on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with quadratic nonlinearities. We demonstrate the well-posedness and convergence of the truncated Carleman linearization under suitable assumptions on the dynamical system, which encompass common parabolic semi-linear partial differential equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear diffusion-advection-reaction equations. Upon discretization, we show that the total approximation error of the linearization decomposes into two independent components: the discretization error and the linearization error. This decomposition yields a convergence radius and convergence rate for the discretized linearization that are independent of the discretization. We thus justify the application of the linearization to parabolic PDE problems. Furthermore, it motivates the use of non-standard structure-exploiting numerical methods, such as sparse grids, taming the curse of dimensionality associated with the Carleman linearization. Finally, we verify the results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Implementation techniques for multigrid solvers for high-order Discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-free geometric multigrid solvers for elliptic PDEs that have been discretised with Higher-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are ideally suited to exploit state-of-the-art computer architectures. Higher polynomial degrees offer exponential convergence, while the workload fits to vector units, is straightforward to parallelise, and exhibits high arithmetic intensity. Yet, DG methods such as the interior penalty DG discreisation do not magically guarantee high performance: they require non-local memory access due to coupling between neighbouring cells and break down into compute steps of widely varying costs and compute character. We address these limitations by developing efficient execution strategies for $hp$-multigrid. Separating cell- and facet-operations by introducing auxiliary facet variables localizes data access, reduces the need for frequent synchronization, and enables overlap of computation and communication. Loop fusion results in a single-touch scheme which reads (cell) data only once per smoothing step. We interpret the resulting execution strategies in the context of a task formalism, which exposes additional concurreny. The target audience of this paper are practitioners in Scientific Computing who are not necessarily experts on multigrid or familiar with sophisticated discretisation techniques. By discussing implementation techniques for a powerful solver algorithm we aim to make it accessible to the wider community.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Characterization of Ensemble Kalman Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The update in the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), called the Ensemble Kalman Update (EnKU), is widely used for Bayesian inference in inverse problems and data assimilation. At each filtering step, it approximates the solution to a likelihood-free Bayesian inversion from an ensemble of particles $(X_i,Y_i)\sim\pi$ sampled from a joint measure $\pi$ and an observation $y_\ast\in\mathbb{R}^m$. The posterior ${\pi}_{X|Y=y_\ast}$ is approximated by transporting $(X_i,Y_i)$ through an affine map $L^{\mathrm{EnKU}}_{y_\ast}(x,y)$ determined by the Kalman gain. While the EnKU is exact for Gaussian joints $\pi$ in the mean-field limit, exactness alone does not fix the update: infinitely many affine maps $L_{y_\ast}$ push a Gaussian $\pi$ to $\pi_{X|Y=y_\ast}$. This raises a question: which affine map should estimate the posterior? We provide a characterization of the EnKU among all such maps. First, we describe the set $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ of laws where the EnKU yields exact conditioning, showing it is larger than the Gaussian family. Next, we prove that, except for a small class of highly symmetric distributions in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ (including Gaussians), the EnKU is the unique exact affine conditioning map. Finally, we ask for the largest possible set $\mathrm{F}$ where any measure-dependent affine transport could be exact; after characterizing $\mathrm{F}$, we show the EnKU's exactness set is almost maximal: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}\cup\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$, where $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$ is a small symmetry class. Thus, among affine transports, the EnKU is near-optimal for exact conditioning beyond Gaussians and is the unique affine update achieving exactness for any measure in $\mathrm{F}$ except a subclass of strongly symmetric laws.</description>

      <title>Zero variance self-normalized importance sampling via estimating equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ordinary importance sampling with a nonnegative integrand there exists an importance sampling strategy with zero variance. Practical sampling strategies are often based on approximating that optimal solution, potentially approaching zero variance. There is a positivisation extension of that method to handle integrands that take both positive and negative values. Self-normalized importance sampling uses a ratio estimate, for which the optimal sampler does not have zero variance and so zero variance cannot even be approached in practice. Strategies that separately estimate the numerator and denominator of that ratio can approach zero variance. This paper develops another zero variance solution for self-normalized importance sampling. The first step is to write the desired expectation as the zero of an estimating equation using Fieller's technique. Then we apply the positivisation strategy to the estimating equation. This paper give conditions for existence and uniqueness of the sample solution to the estimating equation. Then it give conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality and an expression for the asymptotic variance. The sample size multiplied by the variance of the asymptotic formula becomes arbitrarily close to zero for certain sampling strategies.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of solutions for discrete semilinear wave equation with the scale-invariant damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the blow-up problem for discretized scale-invariant nonlinear dissipative wave equations. It is known that the critical exponents for undiscretized equations (continuous equations) are given by Fujita and Strauss exponents depending on the space dimensions. Our purpose is to obtain results for the discretized equations that correspond to those shown for the continuous one. The proof is based on Matsuya [6], who showed the blow-up problem for discrete semilinear wave equations without dissipative terms, and we found that the result is sharp in the case of one and two space dimensions compared to the continuous equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a representation of scalar polynomials of degree $d$ as products of matrices in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers known as phase factors. QSP is the mathematical foundation of quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which is often regarded as one of the most important quantum algorithms of the past decade, with a wide range of applications in scientific computing, from Hamiltonian simulation to solving linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems. In this article we survey recent advances in the mathematical and numerical analysis of QSP. In particular, we focus on its generalization beyond polynomials, the computational complexity of algorithms for phase factor evaluation, and the numerical stability of such algorithms. The resolution to some of these problems relies on an unexpected interplay between QSP, nonlinear Fourier analysis on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, fast polynomial multiplications, and Gaussian elimination for matrices with displacement structure.</description>

      <title>Approximation of differential entropy in Bayesian optimal experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design provides a principled framework for selecting experimental settings that maximize obtained information. In this work, we focus on estimating the expected information gain in the setting where the differential entropy of the likelihood is either independent of the design or can be evaluated explicitly. This reduces the problem to maximum entropy estimation, alleviating several challenges inherent in expected information gain computation.
  Our study is motivated by large-scale inference problems, such as inverse problems, where the computational cost is dominated by expensive likelihood evaluations. We propose a computational approach in which the evidence density is approximated by a Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo surrogate, while the differential entropy is evaluated using standard methods without additional likelihood evaluations. We prove that this strategy achieves convergence rates that are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art methods for full expected information gain estimation, particularly when the cost of entropy evaluation is negligible. Moreover, our approach relies only on mild smoothness of the forward map and avoids stronger technical assumptions required in earlier work. We also present numerical experiments, which confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A semi-Lagrangian method for solving state constraint Mean Field Games in Macroeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time heterogeneous agent models cast as Mean Field Games, in the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett framework. The model couples a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for individual optimization with a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation for the wealth distribution. We establish a comparison principle for constrained viscosity solutions of the HJB equation and propose a semi-Lagrangian (SL) scheme for its numerical solution, proving convergence via the Barles-Souganidis method. A policy iteration algorithm handles state constraints, and a dual SL scheme is used for the FPK equation. Numerical methods are presented in a fully discrete, implementable form.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins: McKean-Pontryagin Control for Partially Observed Physical Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control for fully observed diffusion processes is well established and has led to numerous numerical implementations based on, for example, Bellman's principle, model free reinforcement learning, Pontryagin's maximum principle, and model predictive control. On the contrary, much fewer algorithms are available for optimal control of partially observed processes. However, this scenario is central to the digital twin paradigm where a physical twin is partially observed and control laws are derived based on a digital twin. In this paper, we contribute to this challenge by combining data assimilation in the form of the ensemble Kalman filter with the recently proposed McKean-Pontryagin approach to stochastic optimal control. We derive forward evolving mean-field evolution equations for states and co-states which simultaneously allow for an online assimilation of data as well as an online computation of control laws. The proposed methodology is therefore perfectly suited for real time applications of digital twins. We present numerical results for a controlled Lorenz-63 system and an inverted pendulum.</description>

      <title>The exterior derivative and the mean value equality in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey revisits classical results in vector calculus and analysis by exploring a generalised perspective on the exterior derivative, interpreting it as a measure of "infinitesimal flux". This viewpoint leads to a higher-dimensional analogue of the Mean Value Theorem, valid for differential $k$-forms, and provides a natural formulation of Stokes' theorem that mirrors the exact hypotheses of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - without requiring full $C^1$ smoothness of the differential form.
  As a numerical application, we propose an algorithm for exterior differentiation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that relies solely on black-box access to the differential form, offering a practical tool for computation without the need for mesh discretization or explicit symbolic expressions.</description>

      <title>Neural Hamilton--Jacobi Characteristic Flows for Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method, establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with provable optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.</description>

      <title>Iterative projection method for unsteady Navier-Stokes equations with high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new iterative projection method is proposed to solve the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations with high Reynolds numbers. The convectional projection method attempts to project the intermediate velocity to the divergence free space only once per time step. However, such a velocity is not genuinely divergence free in general practice, which can yield large errors when the Reynolds number is high. The new method has several important features: the BDF2 time discretization, the skew-symmetric convection in a semi-implicit form, two modulating parameters, and the iterative projections in each time step. A major difficulty in the proof of iteration convergence is the nonlinear convection. We solve this problem by first analyzing the non-convective scheme with a focus on the spectral properties of the iterative matrix, and then employing a delicate perturbation analysis for the convective scheme. The work achieves the weakly divergence free velocity (strongly divergence free for divergence free finite element spaces), and the rigorous stability and error analysis when the iterations converge. The three dimensional numerical tests confirm that this new method can effectively treat high Reynolds numbers with only a few iterations per time step, where the convectional projection method and the iterative projection method with the explicit convection would fail.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of finite element sub-complexes of the conformal complex on tetrahedral meshes and show its exactness on contractible domains. This complex includes vector fields and symmetric and traceless tensor fields, interlinked through the conformal Killing operator, the linearized Cotton-York operator, and the divergence operator, respectively. This leads to discrete versions of transverse traceless (TT) tensors, i.e., symmetric, traceless and divergence-free matrix fields, in continuum mechanics and general relativity. We show the inf-sup stability of the $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming finite element symmetric and traceless tensors paired with discontinuous vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general strategy for enforcing multiple conservation laws and dissipation inequalities in the numerical solution of initial value problems. The key idea is to represent each conservation law or dissipation inequality by means of an associated test function; we introduce auxiliary variables representing the projection of these test functions onto a discrete test set, and modify the equation to use these new variables. We demonstrate these ideas by their application to the Navier-Stokes equations. We generalize to arbitrary order the energy-dissipating and helicity-tracking scheme of Rebholz for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and devise a time discretization of the compressible equations that conserves mass, momentum, and energy, and provably dissipates entropy.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Variable Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive-rank integration of {2D and 3D} time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)], scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N {r^2} + {r^{d+1}})$ for $d$-dimensional problems (here, $d = 2$ or $3$), with $N$ the resolution in one dimension and $r$ the maximal rank during the Krylov iteration (which we find to be largely independent of $N$). We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the numerical analysis and simulations of a multi-dimensional memristive device model. Memristive devices and memtransistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated promising potential for neuromorphic computing and next-generation memory technologies. Our charge transport model describes the drift-diffusion of electrons, holes, and ionic defects self-consistently in an electric field. We incorporate two types of boundary models: ohmic and Schottky contacts. The coupled drift-diffusion partial differential equations are discretized using a physics-preserving Voronoi finite volume method. It relies on an implicit time-stepping scheme and the excess chemical potential flux approximation. We demonstrate that the fully discrete nonlinear scheme is unconditionally stable, preserving the free-energy structure of the continuous system and ensuring the non-negativity of carrier densities. Novel discrete entropy-dissipation inequalities for both boundary condition types in multiple dimensions allow us to prove the existence of discrete solutions. We perform multi-dimensional simulations to understand the impact of electrode configurations and device geometries, focusing on the hysteresis behavior in lateral 2D memristive devices. Three electrode configurations -- side, top, and mixed contacts -- are compared numerically for different geometries and boundary conditions. These simulations reveal the conditions under which a simplified one-dimensional electrode geometry can well represent the three electrode configurations. This work lays the foundations for developing accurate, efficient simulation tools for 2D memristive devices and memtransistors, offering tools and guidelines for their design and optimization in future applications.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete analysis of the Galerkin POD neural network approximation with application to 3D acoustic wave scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation of parametric maps using the so-called Galerkin POD-NN method. This technique combines the computation of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and artificial neural networks (NNs) for the construction of fast surrogates of said parametric maps. In contrast to the existing literature, which has studied the approximation properties of this kind of architecture on a continuous level, we provide a fully discrete error analysis of this approach. More precisely, our estimates also account for discretization errors during the construction of the NN architecture. We consider the number of reduced basis in the approximation of the solution manifold, truncation in the parameter space, and, most importantly, the number of samples in the computation of the reduced space, together with the effect of the use of NNs in the approximation of the reduced coefficients. Following this error analysis, we provide a-priori bounds on the required POD tolerance, the resulting POD ranks, and NN parameters to maintain the order of convergence of quasi Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We conclude this work by showcasing the applicability of this method through a practical industrial application: the sound-soft acoustic scattering problem by a parametrically defined scatterer in three physical dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Harmonic Gridded 3D Deconvolution (MH3D) for Robust and Accurate Image Reconstruction in MPI for Single Axis Drive Field Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This work introduces a new magnetic particle imaging (MPI) reconstruction framework based on multi-harmonic 3D deconvolution (MH3D) of gridded portraits, offering a principled, model-driven approach to MPI imaging.
  Approach: MH3D defines a convolutional forward model using higher harmonic portraits, which are gridded images formed from filtered frequency-domain signal components. Each harmonic portrait is modeled as a convolution with a distinct PSF, closely approximated by derivatives of the Langevin function, and incorporates receive sensitivity and mesh downsampling for accurate modeling. We also introduce practical strategies for calibration, phase correction, and artifact reduction.
  Main Results: We validate the MH3D approach using analytic approximations, numerical simulations, and experimental phantom data. MH3D yields high-resolution 3D reconstructions on seconds-scale runtimes, improves image quality relative to common 3rd-harmonic-only reconstructions, and achieves image quality and resolution comparable to a generalized model-based method in simulations and phantom experiments.
  Significance: This work offers new theoretical insight into MPI signal structure, unveiling the methodological and theoretical underpinnings absent in earlier single-harmonic or heuristic methods, thereby supporting accurate and robust 3D imaging with excellent computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo with Gaussian Mixture Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By formulating the inverse problem of partial differential equations (PDEs) as a statistical inference problem, the Bayesian approach provides a general framework for quantifying uncertainties. In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</description>

      <title>Solving advection equations with reduction multigrids on GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for solving hyperbolic systems typically depend on unknown ordering (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, or sweep/wavefront/marching methods) to achieve good convergence. For many discretisations, mesh types or decompositions these methods do not scale well in parallel. In this work we demonstrate that the combination of AIRG (a reduction multigrid which uses GMRES polynomials) and PMISR DDC (a CF splitting algorithm which gives diagonally dominant submatrices) can be used to solve linear advection equations in parallel on GPUs with good weak scaling. We find that GMRES polynomials are well suited to GPUs when applied matrix-free, either as smoothers (at low order) or as an approximate coarse grid solver (at high order). To improve the parallel performance we automatically truncate the multigrid hierarchy given the quality of the polynomials as coarse grid solvers. Solving time-independent advection equations in 2D on structured grids, we find 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in the solve and 47-63% in the setup with AIRG, across the majority of Lumi-G, a pre-exascale GPU machine.</description>

The method employs a combination of rational cubic trigonometric functions within a zipper fractal framework, offering enhanced flexibility through shape parameters and scaling factors. Rigorous error analysis is presented to establish the convergence of the proposed zipper fractal interpolants to the underlying classical fractal functions, and subsequently, to the data-generating function. We derive necessary constraints on the scaling factors and shape parameters to ensure positivity preservation. By carefully selecting the signature, shape parameters, and scaling factors within these bounds, we construct a class of RCTZFIFs that effectively preserve the positive nature of the data, as compared to a reference interpolant that may violate this property. Numerical experiments and visualisations demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach in preserving positivity while offering fractal flexibility.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive CUR Algorithm and its Application to Reduced-Order Modeling of Random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$. CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability. In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sampling projections in the uniform norm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there are sampling projections on arbitrary $n$-dimensional subspaces of $B(D)$ with at most $2n$ samples and norm of order $\sqrt{n}$, where $B(D)$ is the space of complex-valued bounded functions on a set $D$. This gives a more explicit form of the Kadets-Snobar theorem for the uniform norm and improves upon Auerbach's lemma. We discuss consequences for optimal recovery in $L_p$.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum relative entropies on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the renowned Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for directly estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Renyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most $2n+1$ with $n$ being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We prove that our loss function is operator-convex, ensuring that any local minimum is also a global minimum. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and observe the absence of the barren plateau phenomenon. As an application, we employ our algorithm to investigate the superadditivity of quantum channel capacity. Numerical simulations reveal new examples of qubit channels exhibiting strict superadditivity of coherent information, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning to address quantum-native problems.</description>

      <title>Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>STORK: Faster Diffusion And Flow Matching Sampling By Resolving Both Stiffness And Structure-Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and video generation. However, such models require a significant number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, leading to costly inference. Consequently, quality-preserving fast sampling methods that require fewer NFEs have been an active area of research. However, prior training-free sampling methods fail to simultaneously address two key challenges: the stiffness of the ODE (i.e., the non-straightness of the velocity field) and dependence on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE (which limits their direct applicability to flow-matching models). In this work, we introduce the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, addressing both design concerns. We demonstrate that STORK consistently improves the quality of diffusion and flow-matching sampling for image and video generation. Code is available at https://github.com/ZT220501/STORK.</description>

      <title>LoRA meets Riemannion: Muon Optimizer for Parametrization-independent Low-Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel, fully Riemannian framework for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that geometrically treats low-rank adapters by optimizing them directly on the fixed-rank manifold. This formulation eliminates the parametrization ambiguity present in standard Euclidean optimizers. Our framework integrates three key components to achieve this: (1) we derive Riemannion, a new Riemannian optimizer on the fixed-rank matrix manifold that generalizes the recently proposed Muon optimizer; (2) we develop a Riemannian gradient-informed LoRA initialization, and (3) we provide an efficient implementation without prominent overhead that uses automatic differentiation to compute arising geometric operations while adhering to best practices in numerical linear algebra. Comprehensive experimental results on both LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that our approach yields consistent and noticeable improvements in convergence speed and final task performance over both standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Subspace Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.</description>
