      <title>On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have widely been used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.</description>

      <title>Morse Index Classification and Landscape of Kuramoto System for Hebbian-based Binary Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the Kuramoto model with a Hebbian learning rule and second-order Fourier coupling for binary pattern recognition. The system stores memorized binary patterns as stable critical points, enabling it to identify the closest match to a defective input. However, the system exhibits multiple stable states and thus the dynamics are influenced by saddle points and other unstable critical points, which may disrupt convergence and recognition accuracy. We systematically classify the stability of these critical points by analyzing the Morse index, which quantifies the stability of critical points by the number of unstable directions. The index-1 saddle point is highlighted as the transition state on the energy landscape of the Kuramoto model. These findings provide deeper insights into the stability landscape of the Kuramoto model than the stable equilibria, enhancing its theoretical foundation for binary pattern recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a standard Lebesgue space $X$, the strong operator closure of the semigroup generated by conditional expectations on $L^\infty(X)$ contains the group of measure-preserving automorphisms. This is based on a solution to the following puzzle: given $n$ full water tanks, each containing one unit of water, and $n$ empty ones, how much water can be transferred from the full tanks to the empty ones by repeatedly equilibrating the water levels between pairs of tanks?</description>

      <title>The boundary of chaos for piecewise smooth maps and the boundary of positive Hausdorff dimension for survivor sets of open maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the boundary of chaos separating regions of parameter space with positive topological entropy from those with zero topological entropy for a class of piecewise smooth maps. This coincides with the boundary of positive Hausdorff dimension for the survivor sets of a class of open maps. There are precisely two types of codimension one transitions across the boundaries. One of these involves heteroclinic connections, and in this case there is a finite number of periodic orbits at the transition point. The other involves an infinite cascade of bifurcations creating infinitely many periodic orbits on the boundary in a sequence called the anharmonic cascade.</description>

      <title>Generic Embeddings and Isometric Embeddings in Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a generic reservoir system admits a generalized synchronization that is a topological embedding of the input system's attractor. We also prove that for sufficiently high reservoir dimension (given by Nash's embedding theorem) there exists an isometric embedding generalized synchronization. The isometric embedding can be constructed explicitly when the reservoir system is linear.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modeling of Bolt Loosening: Application to a Pair of Oscillators Under Transverse Shock Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety and integrity of engineered structures are critically dependent on maintaining sufficient preload in their bolted joints. This preload can be dynamically lost due to sustained vibrations or sudden shock that are large enough to induce slip in the threads. While high-fidelity finite element simulations and analytical methods can accurately model the loss of preload for a single, their prohibitive computational expense and complexity render them unfeasible for analyzing large-scale structures with many bolts. This creates a critical need for reduced-order models that capture the essential physics of loosening while remaining computationally efficient. This paper introduces a reduced-order modeling methodology for predicting the loosening of bolted lap joints subjected to transverse shock excitation. The core idea is to treat the bolt tension as a dynamic degree-of-freedom that governs the effective properties of the joint through tension-dependent stiffness and damping that couple the components together. The methodology is applied to a pair of oscillators coupled by with a single lap joint with a strain-sensing bolt. Three different sets of experimental measurements are used to interrogate the dynamics of the system. Mathematical models are identified for the joint stiffness and damping and the instantaneous tension, which are combined with the equations of motion for the oscillators to simulate and reproduce the experimental measurements. Ultimately, the results validate the treatment of bolt tension as a dynamic degree-of-freedom, such that the methodology provides an effective framework for predicting loosening behavior in bolted joints.</description>

      <title>Negative Lyapunov exponent of circle maps forced by expanding circle endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study maps on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ that are of the form $F(x,y) = (bx, f_x(y))$, where $b\geq 2$ is an integer. We establish an open class of $C^1$-maps, with $f_x(y)$ that are typically non-monotonic in $x$, for which the Lyapunov exponents on the fibre are negative almost everywhere. For each fixed $f_x(y)$ and a base map $bx$ that is sufficiently expanding, we establish a uniform upper bound for the Lyapunov exponents; moreover, the uniform bound depends on selective characteristics of $f$. This implies that orbits on the same fibre exhibit local synchronisation.</description>

      <title>Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</description>

      <title>A Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_2^\omega$-system of order $5$ that is not Abramov of order $5$, and non-measurability of the inverse theorem for the $U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler \cite{btz} that every Host--Kra $\F_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: \F_2^n \to \C$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6(\F_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$. A simpler version of our construction can also be used to answer a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy \cite{CGSS}.</description>

      <title>Shadowing property and entropy on hyperspace of continua induced by Morse gradient system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that Morse-Smale diffeomorpshisms have the shadowing property; however, the question of whether $C(f)$ also has the shadowing property when $f$ is Morse-Smale remains open and has been resolved only in a few specific cases~\cite{AB}. We prove that if $f:M\to M$ is a time-one-map of Morse gradient flow, the induced map $C(f):C(M)\to C(M)$ on the hyperspace of subcontiuna does not have the shadowing property. Besides, we provide a simple criterion for $f$ that implies $C(f)$ has infinite topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory spacelike singularities: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ vacuum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graph representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Multidimensional Opinions with Topic-Weighted Discordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions on a wide range of topics often evolve over time through their interactions with others. Models of opinion dynamics primarily focus on one-dimensional opinions, which represent opinions on one topic. However, opinions on various topics are rarely isolated; instead, they can be interdependent and correlated. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, agents are receptive to each other only if their opinions are sufficiently similar. We extend classical agent-based BCMs -- namely, the Hegselmann--Krause BCM, which has synchronous interactions, and the Deffuant--Weisbuch BCM, which has asynchronous interactions -- to a multidimensional setting, in which the opinions are multidimensional vectors representing opinions of different topics and opinions on different topics are interdependent. To measure opinion differences between agents, we introduce topic-weighted discordance functions that account for opinion differences in all topics. We define regions of receptiveness for our models, and we use them to characterize the steady-state opinion clusters and provide an analytical approach to compute these regions. In addition, we numerically simulate our models on various networks with initial opinions drawn from a variety of distributions. When initial opinions are correlated across different topics, our topic-weighted BCMs yield significantly different results in both transient and steady states compared to baseline models, where the dynamics of each opinion topic are independent.</description>
