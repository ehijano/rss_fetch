      <title>On the moduli space of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of self-dual $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb T^4$ of topological charge $Q = r/N$, $1 \leq r \leq N-1$, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$, the agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned $\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons in their ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the masses and residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, including $\Omega^*_{ccc}$, $\Omega^*_{ccb}$, $\Omega^*_{bbc}$ and $\Omega^*_{bbb}$, using the QCD sum rules method. Our calculations primarily focus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the ground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial excited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the residues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their possible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve higher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in two distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$. Given the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results with previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies employing various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for experimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the 2-flavour Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a nontrivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from nondegenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a nonlinear $\sigma$ model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <title>Ising on $\mathbb{S}^2$ -- The Affine Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the recent construction \cite{brower2024isingmodelmathbbs2} of the 2d Ising model on a triangulated sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. Surprisingly, this led to a precise map of the lattice couplings to the target geometry in order to reach the conform field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. For the integrable 2d Ising CFT, the map was found analytically \cite{Brower_2023}. Here we conjecture how this might be generalized. The discrete geometry is implemented by the piecewise flat triangulation introduced by Regge in 1960 for the Einstein Hilbert action \cite{Regge1961GeneralRW}. Then following our Ising example, we posit the existence of a smooth map of lattice couplings in affine parameters consistent with quantum correlators. A sequence of theoretical investigations and numerical simulations are recommended to test this conjecture. They begin with non-integrable CFT's -- the 2d $\phi^4$ theory on $\mathbb{S}^2$; the 3d Ising model on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^2$; QED3 on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^{2} $ as an intermediate step to 4d non-Abelian lattice gauge theory on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>
