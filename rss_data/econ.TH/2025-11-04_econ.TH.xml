      <title>The Gatekeeping Expert's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how experts with veto power -- gatekeeping experts -- influence agents through communication. Their expertise informs agents' decisions, while veto power provides discipline. Gatekeepers face a dilemma: transparent communication can invite gaming, while opacity wastes expertise. How can gatekeeping experts guide behavior without being gamed? Many economic settings feature this tradeoff, including bank stress tests, environmental regulations, and financial auditing. Using financial auditing as the primary setting, I show that strategic vagueness resolves this dilemma: by revealing just enough to prevent the manager from inflating the report, the auditor guides the manager while minimizing opportunities for manipulation. This theoretical lens provides a novel rationale for why auditors predominantly accept clients' financial reports. Comparative statics reveal that greater gatekeeper independence or expertise sometimes dampens communication. This paper offers insights into why gatekeepers who lack direct control can still be effective.</description>

      <title>Hope, Signals, and Silicon: A Game-Theoretic Model of the Pre-Doctoral Academic Labor Market in the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified game-theoretic account of how generative AI reshapes the pre-doctoral "hope-labor" market linking Principal Investigators (PIs), Research Assistants (RAs), and PhD admissions. We integrate (i) a PI-RA relational-contract stage, (ii) a task-based production technology in which AI is both substitute (automation) and complement (augmentation/leveling), and (iii) a capacity-constrained admissions tournament that converts absolute output into relative rank. The model yields four results. First, AI has a dual and thresholded effect on RA demand: when automation dominates, AI substitutes for RA labor; when augmentation dominates, small elite teams become more valuable. Second, heterogeneous PI objectives endogenously segment the RA market: quantity-maximizing PIs adopt automation and scale "project-manager" RAs, whereas quality-maximizing PIs adopt augmentation and cultivate "idea-generator" RAs. Third, a symmetric productivity shock triggers a signaling arms race: more "strong" signals flood a fixed-slot tournament, depressing the admission probability attached to any given signal and potentially lowering RA welfare despite higher productivity. Fourth, AI degrades the informational content of polished routine artifacts, creating a novel moral-hazard channel ("effort laundering") that shifts credible recommendations toward process-visible, non-automatable creative contributions. We discuss welfare and equity implications, including over-recruitment with thin mentoring, selectively misleading letters, and opaque pipelines, and outline light-touch governance (process visibility, AI-use disclosure, and limited viva/replication checks) that preserves efficiency while reducing unethical supervision and screening practices.</description>

      <title>Subjective inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An agent observes a clue, and an analyst observes an inference: a ranking of events on the basis of how corroborated they are by the clue. We prove that if the inference satisfies the axioms of Villegas (1964) except for the classic qualitative probability axiom of monotonicity, then it has a unique normalized signed measure representation (Theorem 1). Moreover, if the inference also declares the largest event equivalent to the smallest event, then it can be represented as a difference between a posterior and a prior such that the former is the conditional probability of the latter with respect to an assessed event that is interpreted as a clue guess. Across these Bayesian representations, the posterior is unique, all guesses are in a suitable sense equivalent, and the prior is determined by the weight it assigns to each possible guess (Theorem 2). However, observation of a prior and posterior compatible with the inference could reveal that all of these guesses are wrong.</description>

      <title>Existence of Equilibria in Large Competitive Markets with Bads, Production and Comprehensive Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence of equilibrium in an economy with production and a continuum of consumers, each of whose incomplete and price-dependent preferences are defined on commodities they may consider deleterious, bads which cannot be freely disposed of, and each of whom takes into account the productions of all firms and the consumptions of all other consumers. This result has proved elusive since Hara (2005) presented an example of an atomless measure-theoretic exchange economy with bads (but no externalities) that has no equilibrium. The result circumvents Hara's example by showing that, in the presence of bads and externalities, natural economic considerations imply an integrable bound on the consumption of bads. The proofs make an essential use of nonstandard analysis, and the novel techniques we offer to handle comprehensive externalities expressed as an equivalence class of integrable functions may be of independent methodological interest.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design with Information Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of mechanisms -- e.g., auctions -- when the designer does not control information flows between mechanism participants. A mechanism equilibrium is leakage-proof if no player conditions their actions on leaked information; a property distinct from ex-post incentive compatibility. Only leakage-proof mechanisms can implement social choice functions in environments with leakage. Efficient auctions need to be leakage-proof, while revenue-maximizing ones not necessarily so. Second-price and ascending auctions are leakage-proof; first-price auctions are not; while whether descending auctions are leakage-proof depends on tie-breaking.</description>

      <title>Persuasive Selection in Signaling Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel criterion, persuasiveness, to select equilibria in signaling games. In response to the Stiglitz critique, persuasiveness focuses on the comparison across equilibria. An equilibrium is more persuasive than an alternative if the set of types of the sender who prefer the alternative would sequentially deviate to the former once other types have done so -- that is, if an unraveling occurs. Persuasiveness has strong selective power: it uniquely selects an equilibrium outcome in monotone signaling games. Moreover, in non-monotone signaling games, persuasiveness refines predictions beyond existing selection criteria. Notably, it can also select equilibria in cheap-talk games, where standard equilibrium refinements for signaling games have no selective power.</description>

      <title>Identity-Compatible Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the incentives of the seller and buyers to shill bid in a single-item auction. An auction is seller identity-compatible if the seller cannot profit from pretending to be one or more bidders via fake identities. It is buyer identity-compatible if no buyer profits from posing as more than one bidder. Lit auctions reveal the number of bidders, whereas dark auctions conceal the information. We characterize three classic selling mechanisms -- first-price, second-price, and posted-price -- based on identity compatibility. We show the importance of concealing the number of bidders, which enables the implementation of a broader range of outcome rules. In particular, no optimal lit auction is ex-post seller identity-compatible, while the dark first-price auction (with reserve) achieves the goal.</description>

      <title>From Best Responses to Learning: Investment Efficiency in Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the welfare of a mechanism in a dynamic environment where a learning investor can make a costly investment to change her value. In many real-world problems, the common assumption that the investor always makes the best responses, i.e., choosing her utility-maximizing investment option, is unrealistic due to incomplete information in a dynamically evolving environment. To address this, we consider an investor who uses a no-regret online learning algorithm to adaptively select investments through repeated interactions with the environment. We analyze how the welfare guarantees of approximation allocation algorithms extend from static to dynamic settings when the investor learns rather than best-responds, by studying the approximation ratio for optimal welfare as a measurement of an algorithm's performance against different benchmarks in the dynamic learning environment. First, we show that the approximation ratio in the static environment remains unchanged in the dynamic environment against the best-in-hindsight benchmark. Second, we provide tight characterizations of the approximation upper and lower bounds relative to a stronger time-varying benchmark. Bridging mechanism design with online learning theory, our work shows how robust welfare guarantees can be maintained even when an agent cannot make best responses but learns their investment strategies in complex, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Incentives and Efficiency in Constrained Allocation Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.06776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study private-good allocation under general constraints. Several prominent examples are special cases, including house allocation, roommate matching, social choice, and multiple assignment. Every individually strategy-proof and Pareto efficient two-agent mechanism is a "local dictatorship." Every group strategy-proof N-agent mechanism has two-agent marginal mechanisms that are local dictatorships. These results yield new characterizations and unifying insights for known characterizations. We find all group strategy-proof and Pareto efficient mechanisms for the roommates problem. We give a related result for multiple assignment. We prove the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem and give a partial converse. We also apply our characterization to task allocation and network regulation problems.</description>

      <title>Subgame Credible Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Subgame Credible Nash Equilibrium (SCNE), a refinement of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) for multi-stage games. SCNE retains the internal credibility requirement of SPNE -- equilibrium behavior in every subgame -- and adds an external credibility requirement across equivalent subgames: whenever a player's prescribed continuation strategy differs across equivalent subgames, her own continuation payoff must not decrease. The intuition is that credible punishments or promises should not strictly harm the punisher relative to an equivalent no-punishment subgame. The SCNE eliminates equilibria sustained by self-harming punishments or promises while preserving existence. Every multi-stage game admits an SCNE, and if each stage game has a unique Nash equilibrium, the SCNE is unique.</description>

      <title>Performance Rating Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a novel performance rating system called Performance Rating Equilibrium (PRE). A PRE is a vector of ratings for each player, such that if these ratings were each player's initial rating at the start of a tournament, scoring the same points against the same opponents would leave each player's initial rating unchanged. In other words, all players' initial ratings perfectly predict their actual scores in the tournament. This property, however, does not hold for the well-known Tournament Performance Rating. PRE is defined as a fixed point of a multidimensional rating function. We show that such a fixed point, and hence a PRE, exists under mild conditions. We provide an implementation of PRE along with several empirical applications. PREs have broad applicability, from sports competitions to the evaluation of large language models.</description>

      <title>False Cascades and the Cost of Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning with continuous actions and conformity when agents can endogenously generate hard, publicly verifiable evidence. Actions transmit soft information whose visibility depends on responsiveness to private signals and on observational granularity; investigations produce hard evidence only in the true state and, once found, are disclosed and reset public beliefs. We deliver two primitives. First, a soft-channel informativeness threshold characterizes when actions remain publicly revealing under coarse observation, clarifying why learning can be locally mute at classical cascade boundaries even with continuous actions. Second, a transparent knife-edge for verification guarantees boundary breakability: whenever the expected private return to a one-shot investigation exceeds its cost, occasional disclosures overturn any false cascade with positive probability in finite time. Combining both yields a compact resilience frontier with clean comparative statics in signal quality, responsiveness/conformity, observability, verification quality, and investigation costs. The results provide policy levers -- subsidies to investigation, investments in verification quality, disclosure incentives, and platform design -- that ensure correction of wrong cascades.</description>

      <title>Government Reputation in Ramsey Taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal taxation when citizens hold beliefs about an honest versus opportunistic government and update those beliefs from observed taxes and delivery. In a Ramsey economy with competitive firms, the government privately knows its type: the honest type implements announced taxes and converts revenue into public goods, while the opportunistic type can strategically mimic or divert. Bayesian learning from policy choices and a noisy delivery signal disciplines taxation. We establish a trust cutoff: below it, optimal revenue is zero; above it, the revenue scale is increasing in reputation, with the dynamic cutoff lower than the static one. With broad instruments and symmetric monitoring, dynamic forces act through total revenue while the tax mix is indeterminate along a static equivalence frontier. More informative monitoring (in the Blackwell sense) expands fiscal scale and shrinks the no-tax region.</description>

      <title>TEE-BFT: Pricing the Security of Data Center Execution Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains face inherent limitations when communicating outside their own ecosystem, largely due to the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) 3f+1 security model. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a promising mitigation because they allow a single trusted broker to interface securely with external systems.
  This paper develops a cost-of-collusion principal-agent model for compromising a TEE in a Data Center Execution Assurance design. The model isolates the main drivers of attack profitability: a K-of-n coordination threshold, independent detection risk q, heterogeneous per-member sanctions F_i, and a short-window flow prize (omega) proportional to the value secured (beta times V).
  We derive closed-form deterrence thresholds and a conservative design bound (V_safe) that make collusion unprofitable under transparent parameter choices. Calibrations based on time-advantaged arbitrage indicate that plausible TEE parameters can protect on the order of one trillion dollars in value. The analysis informs the design of TEE-BFT, a blockchain architecture that combines BFT consensus with near-stateless TEEs, distributed key generation, and on-chain attestation to maintain security when interacting with external systems.</description>

      <title>You Are the Best Reviewer of Your Own Papers: The Isotonic Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences including NeurIPS and ICML have experienced a significant decline in peer review quality in recent years. To address this growing challenge, we introduce the Isotonic Mechanism, a computationally efficient approach to enhancing the accuracy of noisy review scores by incorporating authors' private assessments of their submissions. Under this mechanism, authors with multiple submissions are required to rank their papers in descending order of perceived quality. Subsequently, the raw review scores are calibrated based on this ranking to produce adjusted scores. We prove that authors are incentivized to truthfully report their rankings because doing so maximizes their expected utility, modeled as an additive convex function over the adjusted scores. Moreover, the adjusted scores are shown to be more accurate than the raw scores, with improvements being particularly significant when the noise level is high and the author has many submissions -- a scenario increasingly prevalent at large-scale ML/AI conferences.
  We further investigate whether submission quality information beyond a simple ranking can be truthfully elicited from authors. We establish that a necessary condition for truthful elicitation is that the mechanism be based on pairwise comparisons of the author's submissions. This result underscores the optimality of the Isotonic Mechanism, as it elicits the most fine-grained truthful information among all mechanisms we consider. We then present several extensions, including a demonstration that the mechanism maintains truthfulness even when authors have only partial rather than complete information about their submission quality. Finally, we discuss future research directions, focusing on the practical implementation of the mechanism and the further development of a theoretical framework inspired by our mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear-quadratic games of incomplete information with Gaussian uncertainty, where each player's payoff depends on a privately observed type and a common state. The designer observes the state, elicits types, and sells action recommendations. We characterize all implementable mechanisms with Gaussian joint distributions of actions and fundamentals, and identify the players-optimal, consumer-optimal, and revenue-maximizing designs. In games of strategic complements (substitutes), these optimal mechanisms maximally correlate (anticorrelate) players' actions. When type uncertainty is large, recommendations become deterministic linear functions of the state and reports, but remain only partially revealing.</description>
