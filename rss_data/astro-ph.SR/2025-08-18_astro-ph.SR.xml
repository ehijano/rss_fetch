      <title>Three dimensional magnetic reconnection mediated with plasmoids and the resulted multi-thermal emissions in the cool atmosphere of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux emergence is ubiquitous in the Sun's lower atmosphere, where the emerging magnetic flux can reconnect with the pre-existing magnetic field. We investigate plasmoid formation and the resulting multi-thermal emissions during three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in the lower solar atmosphere. We performed 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the MURaM code, which incorporates solar convection and radiative transfer. A flat magnetic flux sheet was introduced into the convection zone to trigger flux emergence. For comparison with previous observations, we used the RH1.5D code to synthesize H{\alpha} and Si IV spectral line profiles, and generated ultraviolet images using the optically thin approximation. The simulations show that flux emergence occurs as the imposed flux tube crosses the photosphere. In the lower solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection forms thin, elongated current sheets, and plasmoid-like structures develop, producing numerous small twisted magnetic flux ropes that are expelled toward both ends of the reconnection region. This process results in the coexistence of hot plasma exceeding 20,000 K and cooler plasma below 10,000 K. Synthetic images and spectral line profiles through the reconnection region exhibit features characteristic of Ellerman bombs (EBs) and UV bursts. Cooler plasma associated with EBs can be found above hot plasma at altitudes exceeding 2 Mm above the solar surface, while hot plasma associated with UV bursts can extend downward into the lower chromosphere, reaching approximately 0.7 Mm above the surface. These results indicate that turbulent reconnection mediated by plasmoid instability can occur in small-scale events such as EBs and UV bursts, and that the coexistence of hot and cool plasma in such reconnection processes can account for UV bursts that are temporally and spatially connected to EBs.</description>

      <title>Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.</description>

      <title>NGC 2392 and NGC 4361: Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Planetary Nebula Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC~2392 and NGC~4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data. The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.</description>

      <title>White dwarf-neutron star binaries: a plausible pathway for long-duration gamma-ray bursts from compact object mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two long-duration gamma-ray bursts were recently discovered with kilonovae, the signature of r-process element production in a compact binary merger, rather than supernovae. This has forced a re-evaluation of the long-established dichotomy between short bursts (&lt; 2s, arising from compact binary mergers) and long bursts (&gt; 2s, a class of massive star core-collapse event). We aim to determine whether white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) and white dwarf-black hole (WDBH) mergers are plausible explanations for long-duration compact merger GRBs, in terms of their galactocentric merger offsets and cosmological rates. We model the host galaxies of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and employ binary population synthesis, to predict the offset distributions of compact mergers. We compare with the observed offsets, investigate evolutionary pathways, predict their cosmological rates, and compare with volumetric GRB rates. We find that WDNS mergers occur at lower host offsets than binary NS mergers, but that in the specific cases of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, the observed offsets are consistent with either scenario. We predict that WDNS mergers occur at a similar rate to binary NS mergers and long GRBs, and that WDBH mergers are a factor of ten rarer, with the caveat that these rates currently carry uncertainties at the order of magnitude level. We have demonstrated, solely in terms of galactocentric offsets and event rates, that WDNS mergers are a plausible explanation for GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and long GRBs from compact object mergers more generally. WDNS binaries have lower systemic velocities than binary neutron stars, but longer delay times, and ultimately merge with an offset distribution that is not measurably different without large samples. Therefore, offsets and rates alone cannot currently distinguish between compact binary progenitor models for supernova-less long duration GRBs.</description>

      <title>The Type II SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: A Red Supergiant with Carbon-rich Circumstellar Dust as the First JWST Detection of a Supernova Progenitor Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present follow-up imaging and spectroscopy and pre-explosion imaging of supernova (SN) 2025pht located in NGC 1637 at 12 Mpc. Our spectroscopy shows that SN 2025pht is a Type II SN with broad lines of hydrogen and with minimal line-of-sight extinction inferred from Na I D absorption. NGC 1637 was the target of several epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging covering the site of SN 2025pht from 31 to 0.7 yr prior to discovery. Using a follow-up HST image of SN 2025pht aligned to these data, we demonstrate that there is a credible progenitor candidate detected in multiple epochs of HST imaging and in JWST imaging from 1.3-8.7 microns, the first JWST counterpart to a SN and the longest wavelength detection of a SN progenitor star. Fitting this source to red supergiant (RSG) spectral-energy distributions (SEDs), we show that it is consistent with a log(L/Lsun) = 5.0 RSG heavily reddened by circumstellar dust. The JWST photometry enable strong constraints on the nature of the circumstellar medium, and we find that the SED favors graphite-rich dust and an optical circumstellar extinction of Av = 5.3 mag as opposed to silicate-rich dust. We discuss the implications of a pre-SN RSG enshrouded in carbon-rich dust and this finding for the overall population of progenitor stars to Type II SN as well as the future of SN progenitor star discovery with JWST.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Abundance Dispersion in the Globular Cluster M5 using Keck Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied $28$ RGB stars in the mildly metal-rich globular cluster M5 ([Fe/H] $= -1.29$) using archival high-resolution spectra from the Keck Observatory archive (KOA) to better understand the $r$-process in globular clusters. Previous studies (M15, M92, and NGC 2298) have shown $r$-process dispersion in varying amounts, hinting at the source of the $r$-process in those clusters. We extend these dispersion studies to the more metal-rich cluster M5 by studying the rare-earth peak, specifically the elements Ba, Nd, and Eu. We separately analyze the different stellar generations, as traced by the abundance of Na and O. Based on the Nd and Eu abundances, we report a tenuous detection of $r$-process dispersion that is dependent on the generation and element. Based on a log-likelihood dispersion study accounting for measurement errors, Nd has an intrinsic first generation abundance spread of $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Nd}) = 0.15_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ and an $2\sigma$ upper limit on the second generation spread of $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Nd}) &lt; 0.28$. The upper limits on the Eu intrinsic spread are $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Eu}) &lt; 0.34$ and $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Eu}) &lt; 0.16$. A potential dispersion implies the cluster gas was inhomogeneously polluted, either due to an event concurrent with the formation of the cluster or due to clouds of disparate composition that coalesced to form the cluster.</description>

      <title>Not-so-heavy metal(s): Chemical Abundances in the Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies Eridanus IV and Centaurus I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present detailed chemical abundances of the brightest star in each of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies Eridanus IV and Centaurus I using high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. The brightest star in Centaurus I, CenI-5136, is a very metal-poor star with metallicity [Fe/H] = $-2.52\pm0.17$ and chemical abundances typical of a star in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. We confirm that the star in Eridanus IV, EriIV-9808, is extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-3.25\pm0.19$) and find that it is carbon-enhanced, with [C/Fe] = $1.07\pm0.34$, as is common for many stars at this metallicity. Both stars are also neutron-capture deficient, which is typical of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, but less common in other environments. We consider possible enrichment scenarios for EriIV-9808 and tentatively conclude that it is unlikely to be the descendant of a single Pop III progenitor, despite its carbon-enhancement and low metallicity.</description>

      <title>Four binary microlenses with directly measured masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys, aiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on two key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings for measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}$), and long durations enabling microlens-parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) measurements. Four events met these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining the normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes with the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude. Additionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve modeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of Earth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and distance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than that of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type of lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby, with distances $\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the Galactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component has a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has about half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater distance, roughly 4.5 kpc.</description>

      <title>Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before they explode: interpreting the nearby supernova SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that massive red supergiants (RSGs) become hydrodynamically unstable and experience radial pulsations before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the early photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can help break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, while hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and SN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show that there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study emphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying SNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Observations of PAH Emission and Evolution in H II Regions of NGC 5457</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with continuum survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>

Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 48 M dwarf stars using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also derived and investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$\geq0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with planetary radii roughly up to 3 R$_{\oplus}$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origins of Galactic Globular Clusters via Their Mg-Al Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) originated in diverse host galaxies before being subsequently incorporated into the Milky Way through hierarchical galaxy assembly. Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] &gt; -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic approaches to rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R &lt;&lt; 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.</description>
