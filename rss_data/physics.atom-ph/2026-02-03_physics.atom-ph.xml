      <title>Fundamental Limits of Large Momentum Transfer in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-momentum-transfer techniques are instrumental for the next generation of atom interferometers as they significantly improve their sensitivity. State-of-the-art implementations rely on elastic scattering processes from optical lattices such as Bloch oscillations or sequential Bragg diffraction, but their performance is constrained by imperfect pulse efficiencies. Here we develop a Floquet-based theoretical framework that provides a unified description of elastic light-atom scattering across all relevant regimes. Within this formalism, we identify practical regimes that exhibit orders of magnitude reduced losses and improved phase accuracy compared to previous implementations. The model's validity is established through direct comparison with exact numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation and through quantitative agreement with recent experimental benchmark results. These findings delineate previously unexplored operating regimes for large-momentum-transfer beam splitters and open new perspectives for precision atom-interferometric measurements in fundamental physics, gravity gradiometry or gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Micro-Knife Sealed Vacuum Cells for Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced integration technologies greatly enhance the prospects and reliability of practical quantum sensors, atomic clocks, and quantum information technologies. The performance and proliferation of these devices at chip-scale is contingent upon developing low leak and low gas permeation vacuum cells using wafer-scale techniques. Here we demonstrate both evacuated atomic beam cells and atomic vapor cells using plastic deformation micro-knife bonding of selectively etched fused silica wafers. The cells are characterized using saturated absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements. Vapor cells are mechanically robust exhibiting sheer-force strength ($\sim 15$MPa), demonstrate long lifetimes ($&gt; 1$ year), low residual gas pressures $ (\ll 10^{-3} \, \text{mbar}) $, and leak rates below fine-leak testing sensitivity ($\ll 2.8 \times 10^{-10} \frac{\text{mBar} \cdot \text{L}}{\text{s}}$). Micro-knife bonding greatly simplifies the fabrication process for complex chip scale atom-beam devices and atomic vapor cells while identifying a path to future chip-scale cold atom devices, improved chip scale atomic clocks, and fieldable dissipation-dilution-limited optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Spin interferometry in a beam of ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a spin interferometer using ultracold YbF molecules and develop the complete set of techniques needed to measure the electron's electric dipole moment, $d_e$, with this apparatus. The molecules are cooled in an optical molasses and prepared in a single internal quantum state. A Raman transition prepares a spin superposition which evolves in parallel magnetic and electric fields before a second Raman transition maps the phase onto the populations of two hyperfine states. These populations are read out using detectors that have spatial and temporal resolution and approach unit efficiency. We characterize the efficiencies and fidelities of all these steps and evaluate the sensitivity of this approach to measuring $d_e$.</description>

      <title>Positronium breakup versus hydrogen ionization in collisions with fast charged projectiles: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comparative study of the breakup of positronium and ionization of atomic hydrogen by projectile-nuclei in the weak perturbation collision regime, $Z_p e_0^2/\hbar \ll v &lt; c $ ($v$ is the collision velocity, $Z_p$ the projectile atomic number, $e_0$ the elementary charge and $c$ the speed of light). In this regime the only principal difference between the collisions with these atomic systems lies in the masses of their positively charged constituents. We have shown that the corresponding mass effects strongly influence the spectra of the target fragments and the total cross sections. This influence manifests itself via i) the significantly smaller binding energy in positronium resulting in smaller momentum transfers necessary to break the system, ii) a strong constructive interference between the inelastic scattering of the projectile on the electron and the positron in collisions with positronium that also increases the chances for the breakup and iii) the "passive" role of the hydrogen nucleus caused by its heavy mass that prohibits hydrogen ionization to proceed via the interaction between the projectile and the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-dependent lifetimes of long-range Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range Rydberg molecules (LRMs) form when a highly excited Rydberg electron scatters from ground-state atoms inside its orbit, creating oscillatory, long-range potentials. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of transition data of astrophysical importance in neutral sulphur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive atomic data are essential for the modelling of stellar spectra. Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods. These levels belong to the configurations $\mathrm{3p^3np (n=3-7)}$, $\mathrm{3p^3nf (n=4,5)}$, $\mathrm{3s3p^5}$, $\mathrm{3p^3ns (n=4-7)}$, and $\mathrm{3p^3nd (n=3-6)}$. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic atomic calibration of oscillating magnetic fields in ULF and VLF bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for absolute calibration of received radio-frequency in the ultra low frequency (ULF), and very low frequency (VLF) range. This is achieved with the use of a radio frequency optically pumped magnetometer (RF-OPM). We describe a method using an optically pumped sample where the RF broadening of the Cs magnetic resonance allows the magnitude of the received field to be calibrated against the ground-state gyromagnetic ratio of the Cs atoms. This frequency-based calibration avoids the geometric and electrostatic response functions that affect inductive sensors, such as fluxgates, search coils, and SQUID magnetometers. We demonstrate calibration of magnetic measurement using oscillating magnetic fields in the 300 Hz - 20 kHz range and a sensor noise floor of 15 fT.Hz-1/2. This radio-frequency sensor may be used as a widely tunable narrowband receiver for communication, ranging, or penetrative conductivity imaging.</description>

      <title>Phase Dynamics of Self-Accelerating Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-accelerating Airy matter waves offer a clean setting to access the cubic Kennard phase. Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates.</description>

      <title>Determination of nuclear quadrupole moments for $^{25}$Mg, $^{87}$Sr, and $^{135,137}$Ba via configuration-interaction combined with a coupled-cluster approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the configuration-interaction plus coupled-cluster approach, we calculate the electric-field gradients $q$ for the low-lying states of alkaline-earth atoms, including magnesium (Mg), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba). These low-lying states specifically include the $3s3p~^3\!P_{1,2}$ states of Mg; the $5s4d~^1\!D_{2}$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{1,2}$ states of Sr; as well as the $6s5d~^3\!D_{1,2,3}$, $6s5d~^1\!D_{2}$, and $6s6p~^1\!P_{1}$ states of Ba. By combining the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine-structure constants of these states, we accurately determine the nuclear quadrupole moments of $^{25}$Mg, $^{87}$Sr, and $^{135,137}$Ba. These results are compared with the available data. The comparison shows that our nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{25}$Mg is in perfect agreement with the result from the mesonic X-ray experiment. However, there are approximately 10\% and 4\% differences between our results and the currently adopted values [Pyykk$\rm \ddot{o}$, Mol. Phys. 116, 1328(2018)] for the nuclear quadrupole moments of $^{87}$Sr and $^{135,137}$Ba respectively. Moreover, we also calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine-structure constants of these states, and the calculated results exhibit good agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic-beam source fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The surface quality and elemental composition of the printed component were quantitatively assessed, allowing us to establish reference parameters for reliable operation in an ultra-high-vacuum environment. Safe operating conditions of the atomic oven were determined through a combination of simulations and experimental measurements. The ability of the device to deliver an atomic beam to the main experimental region -- the electron/ion trap -- was verified using atomic fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence spectroscopy was further employed to characterize the beam divergence, yielding an emission-cone half-angle of approximately 19 degrees for atoms near the beam axis. A current of atoms on the order of $10^8$ s$^{-1}$ was estimated in the electron-trapping region, which is more than sufficient for anticipated electron-trapping and ion-trapping experiments.</description>

      <title>The 1/3 Geometric Constant: Scale Invariance and the Origin of 'Missing Energy' in 3D Quantum Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a universal geometric constraint on the detection of kinetic energy release (KER) in three-dimensional quantum fragmentation. By analyzing the dissociation of localized wavepackets, we demonstrate that the $4\pi r^2$ radial volume element acts as a topological filter that inherently masks a significant portion of a system's energy budget, imposing a fundamental peak-to-mean bound of $R_E &lt; 0.5$. We introduce an invariant scaling law, $\alpha = MQ/\zeta$, and prove that the resulting energy detection ratio is scale-invariant across twelve orders of magnitude, bridging attosecond molecular science and nuclear physics. We identify a universal \textbf{geometric landmark} at $R_E \approx 0.33$, which precisely replicates the 7~eV discrepancy in $H_2^+$ fragmentation. Furthermore, we show that the population of excited-state manifolds and the increase in nuclear localization ($\zeta$) provide a definitive geometric mechanism for the \textbf{spectral broadening} observed across atomic and subatomic scales. Remarkably, the spectral morphology derived from our scaling law aligns with the universal 1/3 energy landmark of historical beta decay, while the high-mass limit naturally accounts for the sharpening of alpha spectra. Our results suggest that ``missing energy'' is often a topological artifact of 3D geometry rather than an exclusive signature of undetected particles. This work establishes a universal master curve for energy reconstruction and identifies a \textbf{``detection crisis''} in highly localized systems, where the true interaction energy becomes effectively invisible to peak-centric calorimetry.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Holstein Primakoff spin codes for local and collective noise</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet most existing codes rely on local control and stabilizer measurements that are difficult to implement in systems dominated by collective interactions. Inspired by spin-GKP codes in PhysRevA.108.022428, we develop a general framework for Holstein-Primakoff spin codes, which maps continuous-variable bosonic codes onto permutation-symmetric spin ensembles via the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that HP codes are robust to both collective and local-spin noise and propose an explicit measurement-free local error recovery procedure to map local noise into correctable collective-spin errors.</description>
