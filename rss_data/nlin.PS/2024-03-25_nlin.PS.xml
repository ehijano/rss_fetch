      <title>Spiral, Core-defect and Wave break in a modified Oregonator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target waves and spiral waves were discovered in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction around 50 years ago. Inwardly rotating spiral waves, also called the anti-spirals, were found in a BZ-AOT system about two decades ago. Many biological systems demonstrate both spiral and anti-spirals. In the glycolytic activity of yeast, anti-spirals are observed, whereas spiral waves are widely studied in the context of broken cardiac waves. In the cardiac system, only outwardly rotating normal spirals are reported. In the context of the cardiac waves, the spirals and scrolls are widely studied in BZ reactions for experimental study. On the other hand, the Oregonator model is considered for the numerical simulation in correlation to the BZ reaction system. In this study, we modified the Oregonator model a little using the same FKN mechanism, and we present a four-variable model that can be called a modified Oregonator system in which we observe the presence of the spiral, spiral defect, and spiral breakup by tuning the parameters.</description>

      <title>Frequency Comb Enhancement via the Self-Crystallization of Vectorial Cavity Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long range interactions between dark vectorial temporal cavity solitons are induced though the spontaneous symmetry breaking of orthogonally polarized fields in ring resonators. Turing patterns of alternating polarizations form between adjacent solitons, pushing them apart so that a random distribution of solitons along the cavity length reaches equal equilibrium distances. Enhancement of the frequency comb is achieved through the spontaneous formation of regularly spaced soliton crystals, 'self-crystallization', with greater power and spacing of the spectral lines for increasing soliton numbers.</description>

      <title>Customizable wave tailoring materials enabled by coupling nonlinear inverse design at two scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive transformation of waves via nonlinear systems is ubiquitous in settings ranging from acoustics to optics and electromagnetics. Passivity is of particular importance for responding rapidly to stimuli, and nonlinearity enormously expands signal transformability compared to linear systems due to the breaking of superposition. It is well known that different types of nonlinearity yield vastly and qualitatively different effects on propagating signals, which raises the question of what precise nonlinearity is the best for a given wave tailoring application? This question has largely remained in the regime of simulation and theory, as, until recently it has not been possible to freely choose any optimal nonlinearity (instead relying on limited tunability around known nonlinear mechanisms). Herein, we leverage recent advances in mechanics, wherein desired nonlinear constitutive responses can be achieved through shape optimization, and couple this to a larger-scale, reduced-order nonlinear dynamical inverse design step. Using minimization of kinetic energy transmission from impact as a case study, we identify ideal nonlinear constitutive responses and the geometries needed to achieve them within a single design process. As part of this, we show the large sensitivity of this metric to small changes in nonlinearity, and thus the need for high precision, free-form nonlinearity tailoring. We validate our predictions using impact experiments in a chain of nonlinear springs and masses. This work sets the foundation for broader passive nonlinear mechanical wave tailoring material design, including future incorporation of higher-dimensionality, irreversibility, material heterogenity, and coupled physics. Potential applications include mechanical computing, acoustic signal and image processing, impact mitigation, and materials that autonomously respond and do work via rapid shape-change.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaker governs synchrony patterns in neuronal inspired networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments in the human brain reveal switching between different activity patterns and functional network organization over time. Recently, multilayer modeling has been employed across multiple neurobiological levels (from spiking networks to brain regions) to unveil novel insights into the emergence and time evolution of synchrony patterns. We consider two layers with the top layer directly coupled to the bottom layer. When isolated, the bottom layer would remain in a specific stable pattern. However, in the presence of the top layer, the network exhibits spatiotemporal switching. The top layer in combination with the inter-layer coupling acts as a symmetry breaker, governing the bottom layer and restricting the number of allowed symmetry-induced patterns. This structure allows us to demonstrate the existence and stability of pattern states on the bottom layer, but most remarkably, it enables a simple mechanism for switching between patterns based on the unique symmetry-breaking role of the governing layer. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaker prevents complete synchronization in the bottom layer, a situation that would not be desirable in a normal functioning brain. We illustrate our findings using two layers of Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) oscillators, employing the Master Stability function approach in small networks to investigate the switching between patterns.</description>
