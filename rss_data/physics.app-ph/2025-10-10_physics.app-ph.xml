      <title>Effect of non-Fourier heat transport on temperature distribution in High Bandwidth Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), as a key development trend in future memory chip technology, significantly enhances computer performance. At the same time, the thermal challenges arising from its stacked architecture have drawn considerable attention. Most existing studies on HBM thermal management are based on Fourier's law, neglecting the non-Fourier effects introduced by the micro/nanoscale structures within HBM. In this study, the Monte Carlo method (MC) is employed to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and investigate the impact of non-Fourier heat transport on the thermal behavior of HBM structures. The results reveal that non-Fourier heat transport leads to a junction temperature that is 59.8 K higher than that predicted by Fourier's law. Furthermore, it is found that the phonon transmittance at the chip interlayers has a severe impact on heat dissipation, with the temperature variation reaching up to 56.6 K. These findings provide more accurate thermal insights, which are critical for the optimized design of HBM systems.</description>

      <title>A controllable anti-P-pseudo-Hermitian mechanical system and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel anti-P-pseudo-Hermitian mechanical system that integrates piezoelectric actuators and sensors with non-reciprocal coupling into mechanical beams is proposed. This configuration enables the system to exhibit programmable exceptional points (EPs), which are critical for enhancing sensitivity in sensing applications. Our theoretical analysis, supported by numerical simulations and experimental validation, demonstrates the system's capability to detect minute mass variations and identify surface cracks with high precision. This advancement not only contributes to the field of non-Hermitian physics but also paves the way for the development of next-generation mechanical sensors leveraging EP physics.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous Synergistic Protection Mechanism in Hybrid Perovskite-Organic Multi-junctions Enables Long-Term Stable and Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (P-O TSCs) hold great promise for next-generation thin-film photovoltaics, with steadily improving power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the development of optimal interconnecting layers (ICLs) remains one major challenge for further efficiency gains, and progress in understanding the improved long-term stability of P-O tandem configuration has been lagging. In this study, we experimentally investigate the enhanced stability of p-i-n P-O TSCs employing a simplified C60/atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) SnOx/PEDOT: PSS ICL without an additional charge recombination layer (CRL), which achieve an averaged efficiency of 25.12% and a hero efficiency of 25.5%. Our finding discovers that the recrystallization of C60, a widely used electron transport layer in perovskite photovoltaics, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during operation, which act as migration channels for the interdiffusion of halide and Ag ions. Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that the tandem device architecture, incorporating organic semiconductor layers, effectively suppresses the bi-directional ion diffusion and mitigates electrode corrosion. Thus, the P-O TSC establishes a mutual protection system: the organic layers stabilize the perovskite sub-cell by suppressing ion diffusion-induced degradation, and the perovskite layer shields the organic sub-cell from spectrally induced degradation. The simultaneous synergistic protection mechanism enables P-O TSCs to achieve exceptional long-term operational stability, retaining over 91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of continuous metal-halide lamp illumination, and to exhibit minimal fatigue after 86 cycles (2067 hours) of long-term diurnal (12/12-hour) testing. These results demonstrate that tandem cells significantly outperform their single-junction counterparts in both efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) are widely used across physics, microscopy, neuroscience, and laser engineering, providing fast, precise, and non-mechanical control of light. While conventional AODs naturally support multiplexing in one and two dimensions, no analogous device has existed for three-dimensional control, leaving a critical gap in rapid focus tuning and 3D beam shaping. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional AOD system capable of multiplexed axial and lateral beam control with high speed and large dynamic range. We achieve this by combining a double-pass AOD with a diffraction grating in the Littrow configuration to realize a compact frequency-tunable lens with multiplexing capability. Our device enables axial scanning over more than twenty Rayleigh ranges with switching rates up to 100 kHz, while simultaneous multi-tone driving produces arbitrary multi-focal beam profiles. By integrating the axial module with lateral deflection, we generate reconfigurable 3D optical patterns. This approach establishes a broadly applicable platform for multiplexed 3D beam control, with potential applications from high-resolution microscopy and laser processing to scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Q chalcogenide micro-racetrack resonators</title>

Abstract: High-quality factor microresonators are an attractive platform for the study of nonlinear photonics, with diverse applications in communications, sensing, and quantum metrology. The characterization of loss mechanisms and nonlinear properties in a microresonator is a necessity for the development of photonic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate a high-quality chalcogenide ($Ge_{23}Sb_{7}S_{70}$) micro-racetrack resonator utilizing Euler curves. The racetrack geometry is studied to minimize loss at both the straight-curved waveguide junction and through the waveguide curve. The material absorption, intrinsic quality factor, and nonlinear index are extracted by a comprehensive model fit to laser wavelength resonance scans. The micro-racetrack resonator possesses an absorption loss of $0.43 dB/m$, an intrinsic quality factor of $4.5 \times 10^6$, and nonlinear index of $1.28 \times 10^{-18} m^2/W$, in a waveguide cross-section less than $1 {\mu}m^2$. Our results yield state-of-the-art nonlinear microresonators and establish $Ge_{23}Sb_{7}S_{70}$ as a low-loss PIC platform.</description>

      <title>Lithographic integration of TES microcalorimeters with SQUID multiplexer circuits for large format spectrometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Probing Phase Diagrams of Ordered Two-Dimensional Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water, a ubiquitous and fundamental substance, plays a critical role across a wide range of disciplines from physics and chemistry to biology and engineering. Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls, experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer and Cu(111) as the substrate. This protocol enables scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to resolve the atomic-scale arrangement of water molecules beneath the h-BN layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques. Simulated STM images unambiguously identify all ordered flat 2D ice phases, as well as coexisting phases, and effectively distinguish them from potential contaminants. These findings establish a robust framework for experiment to systematically probe the phase structures of 2D ice, opening an avenue for studying nanoconfined water under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Electrostatic and Quantum-Confinement Modeling of Silicon Nanowire Double Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson solver with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger solutions along the strongly confined width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling, whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths, we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Optical Kerr Effect in Metasurfaces Featuring Arrays of Rotated Rectangular Holes via Trapped-Mode Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in nanophotonics have demonstrated that various optical resonances in nanostructures can achieve strong field confinement with substantially suppressed scattering. This study investigates the optical Kerr effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index, reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance, characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement maintaining less than 5\% variation for moderate polarization angles and tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections. Compared to bound states in the continuum (BIC), the non-BIC trapped mode demonstrates superior robustness to structural disorder while achieving comparable nonlinear enhancement. These findings suggest promising applications in reflective nonlinear optics, particularly for high harmonic generation and polarization-insensitive photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Kirigami-based Flexible Metasurface with Reconfigurable Intrinsic Chirality from Zero to Near-unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.</description>

      <title>Dominant scattering mechanisms and mobility peak in cryogenic 2D electron transport in Silicon (110) confinement by high-k oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermal stability of inverted perovskite solar cells by bulky passivation with pyridine-functionalized triphenylamine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85{\deg}C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Recommendations and tools to enable reproducibility in 2D materials research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation: A Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>

Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Determining the density of in-gap states in organic semiconductors: A pitfall of photoelectron yield spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.</description>
