      <title>p-adic root separation and the discriminant of integer polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the following related problems: (A) the separation of $p$-adic roots of integer polynomials of a fixed degree and bounded height; and (B) counting integer polynomials of a fixed degree and bounded height with discriminant divisible by a (large) power of a fixed prime. One of the consequences of our findings is the existence, for all large $Q&gt;1$, of $Q^{2/n}$ integer irreducible polynomials $P$ of degree $n$ and height $\asymp Q$ with an almost prime power discriminant of maximal size, that is $|D(P)|\asymp Q^{2n-2}$ and $D(P)=p^kC_P$ with $C_P\in\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $|C_P|\ll1$. The method we use generalises the techniques used in the study of the real case [Beresnevich, Bernik and G\"otze, 2010 and 2016] and relies on a quantitative non-divergence estimate developed by Kleinbock and Tomanov.</description>

      <title>Abelian threefolds with imaginary multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be an abelian threefold defined over a number field K with potential multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field M. If A has signature (2,1) and the multiplication by M is defined over an at most quadratic extension, we attach to A an elliptic curve defined over K with potential complex multiplication by M, whose attached Galois representation is determined by the Hecke character associated to the determinant of the compatible system of lambda-adic representations of A. We deduce that if the geometric endomorphism algebra of A is an imaginary quadratic field, then it necessarily has class number bounded by [K:Q].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $l$ be a rational prime greater than or equal to $3$ and $k$ be a given positive integer. Under a conjecture due to Langland and an assumption on upper bound for the regulator of fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt[l]a\right)$, we prove that there are atleast $x^{1/l-o(1)} $ integers $1\leq d\leq x$ such that the consecutive pure fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt[l]{d+1}\right), \dots ,\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt[l]{d+k}\right) $ have arbitrary large class numbers.</description>

      <title>Congruences like Atkin's for generalized Frobenius partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s Atkin discovered congruences modulo primes $\ell\leq 31$ for the partition function $p(n)$ in arithmetic progressions modulo $\ell Q^3$, where $Q\neq \ell$ is prime. Recent work of the first author with Allen and Tang shows that such congruences exist for all primes $\ell\geq 5$.
  Here we consider (for primes $m\geq 5$) the $m$-colored generalized Frobenius partition functions $c\phi_m(n)$; these are natural level $m$ analogues of $p(n)$. For each such $m$ we prove that there are similar congruences for $c\phi_m(n)\pmod \ell$ for all primes $\ell$ outside of an explicit finite set depending on $m$. To prove the result we first construct, using both theoretical and computational methods, cusp forms of half-integral weight on $\Gamma_0(m)$ which capture the relevant values of $c\phi_m(n)$ modulo~$\ell$. We then apply previous work of the authors on the Shimura lift for modular forms with the eta multiplier together with tools from the theory of modular Galois representations.</description>

      <title>Klein Quartic Curve and its Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local Zeta function of a variety encodes important information about the variety. From the works of Weil, Deligne, Dwork, and others, many things are known about the local Zeta function of a smooth projective variety. In this article, we find the local Zeta function for the Klein Quartic curve, $x^3y+y^3z+z^3x=0$, by realizing it as a quotient of degree 7 Fermat curve. We conclude by giving the associated modular forms via Galois representations.</description>

      <title>Diophantine tuples and product sets in shifted powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and $n\neq 0$. A Diophantine tuple with property $D_k(n)$ is a set of positive integers $A$ such that $ab+n$ is a $k$-th power for all $a,b\in A$ with $a\neq b$. Such generalizations of classical Diophantine tuples have been studied extensively. In this paper, we prove several results related to robust versions of such Diophantine tuples and discuss their applications to product sets contained in a nontrivial shift of the set of all perfect powers or some of its special subsets. In particular, we substantially improve several results by B\'{e}rczes--Dujella--Hajdu--Luca, and Yip. We also prove several interesting conditional results. Our proofs are based on a novel combination of ideas from sieve methods, Diophantine approximation, and extremal graph theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Isogeny Computation on Hyperelliptic Curves: Their Applications in Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present e cient algorithms for computing isogenies between hyperelliptic curves, leveraging higher genus curves to enhance cryptographic protocols in the post-quantum context. Our algorithms reduce the computational complexity of isogeny computations from O(g4) to O(g3) operations for genus 2 curves, achieving significant ciency gains over traditional elliptic curve methods. Detailed pseudocode and comprehensive complexity analyses demonstrate these improvements both theoretically and empirically. Additionally, we provide a thorough security analysis, including proofs of resistance to quantum attacks such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Our findings establish hyperelliptic isogeny-based cryptography as a promising candidate for secure and e cient post-quantum cryptographic systems.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the truncated pentagonal number theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andrews and Merca introduced and proved a $q$-series expansion for the partial sums of the $q$-series in Euler's pentagonal number theorem. Kolitsch, in 2022, introduced a generalization of the Andrews-Merca identity via a finite sum expression for $ \sum_{n \geq k} \frac{ q^{ (k + m) n } }{ \left( q; q \right)_{n} } \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} n - 1 \\ k - 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right]_{q}$ for positive integers $m$, and Yao also proved an equivalent evaluation for this $q$-series in 2022, and Schlosser and Zhou extended this result for complex values $m$ in 2024, with the $m = 1$ case yielding the Andrews-Merca identity, and with the $m = 2$ case having been proved separately by Xia, Yee, and Zhao. We introduce and apply a method, based on the $q$-version of Zeilberger's algorithm, that may be used to obtain finite sum expansions for $q$-series of the form $ \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{ q^{ p(k) n } }{ \left( q; q \right)_{n + \ell_2} } \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} n - \ell_{1} \\ k - 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right]_{q} $ for linear polynomials $p(k)$ and $\ell_{1} \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\ell_{2} \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$, thereby generalizing the Andrews-Merca identity and the Kolitsch, Yao, and Schlosser-Zhou identities. For example, the $(p(k), \ell_1, \ell_2) = (k+1, 2, 0)$ case provides a new truncation identity for Euler's pentagonal number theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an abelian variety and its dual over a global field have the same Faltings height and, more precisely, have isomorphic Hodge line bundles, including their natural metrized bundle structures. More carefully treating real places, we also show that these abelian varieties have the same real and global periods that appear in the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.</description>

      <title>The rationality problem for multinorm one tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the multinorm one tori to be stably rational and retract rational in the case that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois groups. This generalizes the result of Endo in 2011 on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we develop the technique of Endo in 2001, and construct some reduction methods for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be an extension of number fields that is ramified above $p$. We give a new obstruction to the descent to $K$ of smooth projective varieties defined over $L$. The obstruction is a matrix of $p$-adic numbers that we call ``ramified periods'' arising from the comparison isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and crystalline cohomology. As an application, we give simple examples of hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt p)$ that are isomorphic to their Galois conjugates but such that their Jacobians do not descend to $\mathbb{Q}$ even up to isogeny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1984, Andrews introduced the family of partition functions $c\phi_k(n)$, the number of generalized Frobenius partitions of $n$ with $k$ colors. In 2016, Gu, Wang, and Xia proved some congruences about $c\phi_6(n)$ and gave a conjecture on congruences modulo powers of 3 for $c\phi_6(n)$. We solve the revised conjecture proposed by Gu, Wang, and Xia using a method similar to that of Banerjee and Smoot.</description>

      <title>Lattice packing of spheres in high dimensions using a stochastically evolving ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any dimension $n$ there exists an origin-symmetric ellipsoid ${\mathcal{E}} \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ of volume $ c n^2 $ that contains no points of ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$ other than the origin, where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously known constructions of sphere packings in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ had densities of the order of magnitude of $n \cdot 2^{-n}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof utilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$ lattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its interior except for the origin.</description>

      <title>A Fast Multiplication Algorithm and RLWE-PLWE Equivalence for the Maximal Real Subfield of the $2^r p^s$-th Cyclotomic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves the RLWE-PLWE equivalence for the maximal real subfields of the cyclotomic fields with conductor $n = 2^r p^s$, where $p$ is an odd prime, and $r \geq 0$ and $s \geq 1$ are integers. In particular, we show that the canonical embedding as a linear transform has a condition number bounded above by a polynomial in $n$. In addition, we describe a fast multiplication algorithm in the ring of integers of these real subfields. The multiplication algorithm uses the fast Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and has computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. Both the proof of the RLWE-PLWE equivalence and the fast multiplication algorithm are generalizations of previous results by Ahola et al., where the same claims are proved for a single prime $p = 3$.</description>

      <title>Elliptic multiple zeta values, Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller and mould theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.09050v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we define an elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra $ds_{ell}$ that generalizes the well-known double shuffle Lie algebra $ds$ to the elliptic situation. The double shuffle, or dimorphic, relations satisfied by elements of the Lie algebra $ds$ express two families of algebraic relations between multiple zeta values that conjecturally generate all relations. In analogy with this, elements of the elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra $ds_{ell}$ are Lie polynomials having a dimorphic property called $\Delta$-bialternality that conjecturally describes the (dual of the) set of algebraic relations between elliptic multiple zeta values, periods of objects of the category $MEM$ of mixed elliptic motives defined by Hain and Matsumoto. We show that one of Ecalle's major results in mould theory can be reinterpreted as yielding the existence of an injective Lie algebra morphism $ds\rightarrow ds_{ell}$. Our main result is the compatibility of this map with the tangential-base-point section ${\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MTM)\rightarrow {\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MEM)$ constructed by Hain and Matsumoto and with the section $grt\rightarrow grt_{ell}$ mapping the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra $grt$ into the elliptic Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra $grt_{ell}$ constructed by Enriquez.</description>

      <title>ARI, GARI, Zig and Zag: An introduction to Ecalle's theory of multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:1507.01534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This text has two goals. The first is to give an introduction to Ecalle's work on mould theory, multiple zeta values and double shuffle theory and relate this work explicitly to the classical theory of multiple zeta values and double shuffle expressed in the usual terms of non-commutative variables. The second is to provide complete proofs of those of his main results and identities which are strictly useful in the context of (non-colored) multiple zeta values. Many of these proofs are difficult, laborious and not enlightening and have been relegated to appendices. The emphasis in the text is to provide an easily approachable introduction to Ecalle's language while placing it almost from the start in the context of multiple zeta value theory.
  Disclaimer: This text is not final and is not submitted for publication. The intention is to continue to add to and complete it over time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the ramified local integrals in the doubling method and present an integral representation of standard $L$-functions for classical groups. We explicitly construct local sections of Eisenstein series such that the local ramified integrals represent certain ramified $L$-factors. As an application, we prove algebraicity of special $L$-values and construct $p$-adic $L$-functions for symplectic, unitary, quaternionic unitary and quaternionic orthogonal groups.</description>

      <title>Angular distribution towards the points of the neighbor-flips modular curve seen by a fast moving observer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $h$ be a fixed non-zero integer. For every $t\in \mathbb{R}_+$ and every prime $p$, consider the angles between rays from an observer located at the point $(-tJ_p^2,0)$ on the real axis towards the set of all integral solutions $(x,y)$ of the equation $y^{-1}-x^{-1}\equiv h \pmod{p}$ in the square $[-J_p,J_p]^2$, where $J_p=(p-1)/2$. We prove the existence of the limiting gap distribution for this set of angles as $p\rightarrow \infty$, providing explicit formulas for the corresponding density function, which turns out to be independent of $h$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Brun--Titchmarsh theorem gives an upper bound, which is of correct order of magnitude in the full range, for the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ satisfying $p\equiv a\bmod q$. We strength this inequality for $\log q/\log x$ in different ranges, improving upon previous works by Motohashi, Goldfeld, Iwaniec, Friedlander and Iwaniec, and Maynard for general or special moduli. In particular, we are able to beat Iwaniec's barrier $q&lt;x^{9/20-}$, and improve all the existing inequalities in the range $x^{9/20}\ll q&lt;x^{1/2-}$ by utilizing bilinear or trilinear structures in the remainder terms of linear sieve. The proof is based on various estimates for character and exponential sums, by appealing to arithmetic exponent pairs and bilinear forms with algebraic trace functions from $\ell$-adic cohomology, trilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions, and sums of Kloosterman sums from spectral theory of automorphic forms, as well as large value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero). These results are then generalized to certain ramified $p$-adic Lie extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express the Mahler measure of an exact polynomial in arbitrarily many variables in terms of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology using the Goncharov polylogarithmic complexes. Applying this to the case of four-variable exact polynomials, we study the relationship between the Mahler measure and the special value of $L$-functions of $K3$ surfaces at $s = 4$. This result is an extension of the three-variable case in \cite{Tri23}. In particular, we study the motivic cohomology and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology of singular $K3$ surfaces. Finally, we prove, under Beilinson's conjecture, that the Mahler measure of the four-variable exact polynomial $(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) + t$ is expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the $L$-function of the modular form of weight 3, level 7.</description>

      <title>Relating two conjectures in $p$-adic Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Fontaine has constructed a useful classification of $p$-adic representations of $\mathcal{G}_K$ in terms of cyclotomic $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.
  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors and explain what is the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the higher rings of periods $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$ in this setting. We then use this result to construct, in the anticyclotomic setting and assuming that Kedlaya's conjecture holds, an element in the field of fractions of the Robba ring which ``should not exist'' according to a conjecture of Berger. As a consequence, we prove that this conjecture of Berger on substitution maps on the Robba ring is incompatible with Kedlaya's conjecture.
  Should Berger's conjecture hold, this would provide an example of an extension for which there is no overconvergent lift of its field of norms and for which there exist nontrivial higher locally analytic vectors.</description>

Abstract: We say that a monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $N\ge 2$ is monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{N-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. In this article, we investigate the divisibility of the class numbers of quadratic fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{\delta})$ for certain families of monogenic trinomials $f(x)=x^N+Ax+B$, where $\delta\ne \pm 1$ is a squarefree divisor of the discriminant of $f(x)$.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations as a conjectural classification of all modular-invariant representations of the affine Kac--Moody algebras. For the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ their conjectural construction has been proved. Using their construction, Ahn, Chung, and Tye introduced the generalized Fateev--Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. The characters of these parafermionic theories are string functions of admissible representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ up to a simple appropriate factor. Determining modular properties or explicitly calculating string functions and branching coefficients is an important yet wide-open problem. Outside of initial works of Kac, Peterson, and Wakimoto, little is known. Here we take a new approach by first developing a quasi-periodic notion of admissible string functions and then calculating the Zagier--Zwegers' polar-finite decomposition for the admissible characters. As an application of the decomposition, we extend the results of our paper (Borozenets and Mortenson, 2024) for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$, in that we obtain families of new mock theta conjecture-like identities for $1/3$ and $2/3$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's mock theta functions $f_3(q)$ and $\omega_3(q)$. We also obtain an analogous family of new identities for the $1/5$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's four tenth-order mock theta functions. In addition, we give a heuristic argument for an expansion of the general positive-level admissible string functions in terms of Appell functions.</description>

Abstract: We give counterexamples for the modification on Malle's Conjecture given by T\"urkelli. T\"urkelli's modification on Malle's conjecture is inspired by an analogue of Malle's conjecture over a function field. As a consequence, our counterexamples demonstrate that the $b$ constant can differ between function fields and number fields. We also show that Kl\"uners' counterexamples give counterexamples for a natural extension of Malle's conjecture to counting number fields by product of ramified primes. We then propose a refined version of Malle's conjecture which implies a new conjectural value for the constant $b$ for number fields.</description>

      <title>Several-variable Kronecker limit formula over global function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Kronecker-type first and second limit formulas for "non-holomorphic" and "Jacobi-type" Eisenstein series over global function fields in the several-variable setting. Our main theorem demonstrates that the derivatives of these Eisenstein series can be understood as averaged integrals of certain period quantities along the associated "Heegner cycles" on Drinfeld modular varieties. A key innovation lies in our use of the Berkovich analytic structure of the Drinfeld period domains, which enables the parametrization of the Heegner cycles in question by Euclidean "parallelepiped" regions. This approach also facilitates a unified and streamlined formulation and proof of our results. Finally, we apply these formulas to provide period interpretations of the "Kronecker terms" of Dedekind-Weil zeta functions and Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with ring and ray class characters.</description>

      <title>Pair Correlation Conjecture for the Zeros of the Riemann Zeta-function I: Simple and Critical Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montgomery in 1973 introduced the Pair Correlation Conjecture (PCC) for zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. He also showed that a stronger conjecture would imply that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are simple. His reasoning to support these two conjectures made free use of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Building on Montgomery's approach, Gallagher and Mueller proved in 1978 that PCC under RH implies that 100% of the zeros are simple, but we show here that their method does not actually require RH. Thus Montgomery's second conjecture follows from his PCC conjecture. Recent work has shown that one can use pair correlation methods to obtain information not only on the vertical distribution of zeros, but also on the horizontal distribution. Applying this idea to Gallagher and Mueller's method, we show that PCC implies that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line.</description>

Abstract: A vector (compound) partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of regular (scalar) partitions. For the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a coarse algebraic invariant for coarse groups and use it to differentiate various coarsifications of the group of integers. This lets us answer two questions posed by Leitner and the second author. The invariant is obtained by considering the set of exponents n such that taking n-th powers defines a coarse equivalence of the coarse group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the modulo $2$ de Rham-Witt complex of a field of characteristic $2$, in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-geometric fixed points of real topological restriction homology TRR. This is analogous to the conjecture of Milnor, proved by Kato for fields of characteristic $2$, which describes the modulo $2$ Milnor K-theory in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the Witt group of symmetric forms. Our proof provides a somewhat explicit description of these objects, as well as a calculation of the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed points of TRR and of real topological cyclic homology, for all fields.</description>

Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups. Our approach is geometric as opposed to analytic, explains the presence of Curry-Schoenberg B-splines as limiting distributions, and provides explicit error bounds (no implied constants left unspecified). Along the way, we explicitly bound the difference between the vector partition function and the number of integer points in the variable polytope for a $2 \times k$ matrix.</description>
