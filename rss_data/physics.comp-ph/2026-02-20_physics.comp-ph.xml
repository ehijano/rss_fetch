      <title>Distillation and Interpretability of Ensemble Forecasts of ENSO Phase using Entropic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Hamiltonians are Accurate Energy-Force Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning Hamiltonian (MLH) models have gained traction as fast approximations of electronic structures such as orbitals and electron densities, while also enabling direct evaluation of energies and forces from their predictions. However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations.</description>

      <title>Order of Magnitude Analysis and Data-Based Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression for Turbulent Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction losses in rough pipes are often predicted using semi-empirical correlations, such as the Colebrook-White equation (Colebrook,1939), which do not fully replicate Nikuradse's rough-pipe experiments (1950). This study derives scaling relations for the viscous and turbulent contributions to the streamwise pressure drop through an order-of-magnitude analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the kinetic-energy transport equations. These relations impose constraints on the local sensitivity of the pressure drop to factors such as mean velocity, roughness, viscosity, and density through exponent envelopes and serve as a physical prior for symbolic regression. By combining Nikuradse's rough-pipe and smooth-pipe data of Zagarola and Smits (1998), we aim to derive compact correlations for the friction factor that fit experimental data while adhering to the derived constraints. A modified genetic programming engine (GPTIPS2) optimizes model structure and evaluates it based on fitness, complexity, and constraint violation. This method yields interpretable expressions that accurately reproduce friction factors across various roughness levels and Reynolds numbers, validated up to $Re \sim 10^7$.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Transport-Based Generative Models and Latent Geometry for Stochastic Closure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.</description>

      <title>Universal Fine-Grained Symmetry Inference and Enforcement for Rigorous Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.</description>

      <title>On the Concept of Violence: A Comparative Study of Human and AI Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: What counts as violence is neither self-evident nor universally agreed upon. While physical aggression is prototypical, contemporary societies increasingly debate whether exclusion, humiliation, online harassment or symbolic acts should be classified within the same moral category. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being consulted in everyday contexts to interpret and label complex social behaviors. Whether these systems reproduce, reshape or simplify human conceptions of violence remains an open question. Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning.</description>

      <title>Semi-Local Exchange-Correlation Approximations in Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure calculations, with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and machine learning. At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.
  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.
  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Relativistic Plasmas with a Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom by comparing different modes of implementation of extended phase space integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Eggbox Ising model, a tunable construction of rugged energy landscapes defined by distances to a prescribed set of patterns. Correlated pattern ensembles realize arbitrary k-step replica-symmetry-breaking structures and controllable Parisi overlap distributions p(q), consistent with the hierarchical overlap structure observed in a simple word-embedding example from empirical data. A softened variant allows a systematic expansion leading to Hopfield-type couplings (and higher-body terms). We analyze the density of states and show that suitable potentials induce discontinuous finite-temperature transitions with metastability and hysteresis.</description>

Abstract: We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geant4's Electromagnetic Physics Constructors on Accuracy and Performance of Simulations for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g. the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to implement the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of implementations: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_4$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.</description>

      <title>Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</description>

      <title>Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</description>
