      <title>Interpreting CFD Surrogates through Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based surrogate models have become a practical alternative to high-fidelity CFD solvers, but their latent representations remain opaque and hinder adoption in safety-critical or regulation-bound settings. This work introduces a posthoc interpretability framework for graph-based surrogate models used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By obtaining an overcomplete basis in the node embedding space of a pretrained surrogate, the method extracts a dictionary of interpretable latent features. The approach enables the identification of monosemantic concepts aligned with physical phenomena such as vorticity or flow structures, offering a model-agnostic pathway to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in CFD applications.</description>

      <title>Computational design of personalized drugs via robust optimization under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective disease treatment often requires precise control of the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In this work, we present a computational inverse design approach to determine the optimal drug composition that yields a target release profile. We assume that the drug release is governed by the Noyes-Whitney model, meaning that dissolution occurs at the surface of the drug. Our inverse design method is based on topology optimization. The method optimizes the drug composition based on the target release profile, considering the drug material parameters and the shape of the final drug. Our method is non-parametric and applicable to arbitrary drug shapes. The inverse design method is complemented by robust topology optimization, which accounts for the random drug material parameters. We use the stochastic reduced-order method (SROM) to propagate the uncertainty in the dissolution model. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, SROM requires fewer samples and improves computational performance. We apply our method to designing drugs with several target release profiles. The numerical results indicate that the release profiles of the designed drugs closely resemble the target profiles. The SROM-based drug designs exhibit less uncertainty in their release profiles, suggesting that our method is a convincing approach for uncertainty-aware drug design.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Portfolio Optimization Via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to portfolio optimization, often rooted in Modern Portfolio Theory and solved via quadratic programming or evolutionary algorithms, struggle with scalability or flexibility, especially in scenarios involving complex constraints, large datasets and/or multiple conflicting objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for multi-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with automatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such as minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with realistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or asset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six experimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective cases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY and SKFOLIO. Our results show that our method achieves competitive performance while offering enhanced flexibility for modeling multiple objectives and constraints. We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers and practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CO$_2$ Storage Simulations: Results from the 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project (shortened SPE11 herein) benchmarked simulation tools for geological carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) storage. A total of 45 groups from leading research institutions and industry across the globe signed up to participate, with 18 ultimately contributing valid results that were included in the comparative study reported here.
  This paper summarizes the SPE11. A comprehensive introduction and qualitative discussion of the submitted data are provided, together with an overview of online resources for accessing the full depth of data. A global metric for analyzing the relative distance between submissions is proposed and used to conduct a quantitative analysis of the submissions. This analysis attempts to statistically resolve the key aspects influencing the variability between submissions.
  The study shows that the major qualitative variation between the submitted results is related to thermal effects, dissolution-driven convective mixing, and resolution of facies discontinuities. Moreover, a strong dependence on grid resolution is observed across all three versions of the SPE11. However, our quantitative analysis suggests that the observed variations are predominantly influenced by factors not documented in the technical responses provided by the participants. We therefore identify that unreported variations due to human choices within the process of setting up, conducting, and reporting on the simulations underlying each SPE11 submission are at least as impactful as the computational choices reported.</description>

      <title>Modeling Maritime Transportation Behavior Using AIS Trajectories and Markovian Processes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is central to the global economy, and analyzing its large-scale behavioral data is critical for operational planning, environmental stewardship, and governance. This work presents a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to model vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with particular emphasis on disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the maritime domain into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for distinct vessel types using cell transition frequencies and dwell times. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize maritime dynamics across multiple temporal resolutions. Focusing on commercial, fishing, and passenger vessels, we analyze the temporal evolution of mobility behaviors during the pandemic, highlighting significant yet transient disruptions to recurring transport patterns. The methodology we contribute to this paper allows for an extensive behavioral analytics key for transportation planning. Accordingly, our findings reveal vessel-specific mobility signatures that persist across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting behaviors invariant to time. In contrast, we observe temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, reflecting the influence of social isolation measures and operational constraints on non-essential maritime transport in this region.</description>
