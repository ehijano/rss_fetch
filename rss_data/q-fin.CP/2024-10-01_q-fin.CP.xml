      <title>Interpool: a liquidity pool designed for interoperability that mints, exchanges, and burns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of proper interoperability poses a significant challenge in leveraging use cases within the blockchain industry. Unlike typical solutions that rely on third parties such as oracles and witnesses, the interpool design operates as a standalone solution that mints, exchanges, and burns (MEB) within the same liquidity pool. This MEB approach ensures that minting is backed by the locked capital supplied by liquidity providers. During the exchange process, the order of transactions in the mempool is optimized to maximize returns, effectively transforming the front-running issue into a solution that forges an external blockchain hash. This forged hash enables a novel protocol, Listrack (Listen and Track), which ensures that ultimate liquidity is always enforced through a solid burning procedure, strengthening a trustless design. Supported by Listrack, atomic swaps become feasible even outside the interpool, thereby enhancing the current design into a comprehensive interoperability solution</description>

      <title>GARCH-Informed Neural Networks for Volatility Prediction in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility, which indicates the dispersion of returns, is a crucial measure of risk and is hence used extensively for pricing and discriminating between different financial investments. As a result, accurate volatility prediction receives extensive attention. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model and its succeeding variants are well established models for stock volatility forecasting. More recently, deep learning models have gained popularity in volatility prediction as they demonstrated promising accuracy in certain time series prediction tasks. Inspired by Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), we constructed a new, hybrid Deep Learning model that combines the strengths of GARCH with the flexibility of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Network (DNN), thus capturing and forecasting market volatility more accurately than either class of models are capable of on their own. We refer to this novel model as a GARCH-Informed Neural Network (GINN). When compared to other time series models, GINN showed superior out-of-sample prediction performance in terms of the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</description>

      <title>KANOP: A Data-Efficient Option Pricing Model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce the KAN-based Option Pricing (KANOP) model to value American-style options, building on the conventional Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm. KANs, which are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a data-efficient alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons, requiring fewer hidden layers to achieve a higher level of performance. By leveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to the conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the model to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected continuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American options, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value estimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios involving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is also more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which is crucial for effective option hedging. Graphical illustrations further validate KANOP's ability to accurately model the expected continuation value for American-style options.</description>

      <title>Strategic Collusion of LLM Agents: Market Division in Multi-Commodity Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning technologies are seeing increased deployment in real-world market scenarios. In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Tighter 'uniform bounds for Black-Scholes implied volatility' and the applications to root-finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the option delta systematically, we derive tighter lower and upper bounds of the Black-Scholes implied volatility than those in Tehranchi [SIAM J. Financ. Math. 7 (2016), 893-916]. As an application, we propose a Newton-Raphson algorithm on the log price that converges rapidly for all price ranges when using a new lower bound as an initial guess. Our new algorithm is a better alternative to the widely used naive Newton-Raphson algorithm, whose convergence is slow for extreme option prices.</description>
