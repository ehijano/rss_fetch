      <title>Detection of a highly stable orbital-period signal in GRACE-FO one-way intersatellite ranging using a synchronization-free differential observable (origin currently unidentified)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a consistent, large-amplitude signal using a new synchronization-free protocol for probing directional time-dilation asymmetries with one-way ranging data between Earth-orbiting satellites. Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.
  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.</description>

      <title>How to pick the best anomaly detector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Potential for Non-Ergodic Replication Dynamics:An Information-Theoretic Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to quantify and visualize the degradation of fidelity (information degradation) that inevitably accompanies the replication of information within the framework of information thermodynamics and to propose an information-theoretic formulation of the second law based on this phenomenon. While previous research in information thermodynamics has focused on the thermodynamic costs associated with information "erasure'' or "measurement'' through concepts such as Landauer's principle and mutual information, little systematic discussion has addressed the inherently irreversible nature of "replication'' itself and the accompanying degradation of information structure. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of information replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution, and quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy, cross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic decrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as a potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a nonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information processes such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for degradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD. This contributes to building a unified information-thermodynamic framework for operations such as replication, transmission, and repair of information.</description>

      <title>NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.
  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.</description>
