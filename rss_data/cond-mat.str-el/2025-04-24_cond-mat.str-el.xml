      <title>Bosonic vs. Fermionic Matter in Quantum Simulations of $2+1$D Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>Weyl nodes and Kondo interaction in noncentrosymmetric semimetals RGaGe (R=La, Ce and Pr) with long Fermi arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals based on rare-earth compounds, the correlation effects among $f$ electrons may play a crucial role in shaping the properties of Weyl nodes, potentially giving rise to magnetic Weyl semimetals or correlated Weyl excitations. Here, we investigates a recently identified class of magnetic rare-earth Weyl semimetals, RGaGe (R = La, Ce, and Pr). By employing a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, we demonstrate that under ambient pressure, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe and PrGaGe are nearly fully localized. Concurrently, three inequivalent types of Weyl nodes emerge near the Fermi level due to intersections between $spd$ bands. Notably, one type of Weyl point exhibits substantial chiral separation (significantly greater than in CeAlSi and CeAlGe), leading to the formation of long and well-defined surface Fermi arcs on the (001) surface. These Fermi arcs remain well-separated by bulk states, thereby facilitating future experimental observations. In contrast, the chiral separation of Weyl points in LaGaGe is relatively modest. Upon application of volume compression, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe progressively become itinerant and begin to obscure the Weyl nodes formed by $spd$ electrons, rendering them less accessible for direct observation. These findings suggest that in correlated materials, particularly $f$-electron systems, even when $f$ electrons do not directly contribute to the formation of topological nodes, they can still exert a profound influence on the characteristics of Weyl nodes.</description>

      <title>Dual role of stripe phase on superconducting correlation in a bilayer square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the stripe phase has been observed not only in monolayer cuprates but also in bilayer cuprates, research on its behavior in bilayer cuprates has been limited. Using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo, we explore the effect of stripes on the bilayer square lattice. We find the system exhibits short-range antiferromagnetism, which is enhanced by stripes and is strongest when the electron density of the interstriped rows reaches half-filling. The hole doping concentration plays a crucial role in the interaction between stripes and superconductivity. The $d$-wave pairing is enhanced by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/4$, whereas it is suppressed by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/8$. We elucidate this phenomenon through an analysis of the magnetism of the interstriped rows. Furthermore, the effective $d$-wave pairing is stronger in the bilayer model compared to the monolayer model when stripes are introduced on the square lattice. Overall, our unbiased numerical simulations provide a further understanding of the crossed bilayer square lattice model.</description>

      <title>Magnetically disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnets Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids~(QSLs) represent a unique quantum disordered state of matter that hosts long-range quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. However, structural disorder resulting from site mixing between different types of ions usually arises in real QSL candidates, which is considered as an obstacle to gain the insight into the intrinsic physics. Here, we have synthesized two new rare-earth compounds Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice structure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do not capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8~K. A fit to low-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with the Curie-Weiss temperature of -1.40~K and -0.43~K for Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and Cs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$, respectively. Specific heat results show no sign of long-range magnetic order down to $\sim$0.1~K either, but only a Schottky anomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields. Additionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy spin excitations in Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. The absence of magnetic excitation signals as well as static magnetic order down to 97~mK aligns with the results from magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings point to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics, reminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for further exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system.</description>

      <title>Metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrochlore oxides with chemical formula of A2B2O7 exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties as a representative family of quantum materials. These properties mostly stem from strong electron correlations at the transition metal B site and typical geometrical frustration effects on the pyrochlore lattice. Furthermore, the coupling between the magnetic moments of the rare-earth A site and the conduction electrons at the B site, along with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling particularly affecting the 4d/5d electrons at the B site, gives rise to the topological characteristics of the correlated electrons. This review paper focuses on the metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides as evidence of the strong electron correlation, which is highlighted as a rich source of intriguing charge dynamics coupled with frustrated spin-orbital entangled magnetism.</description>

      <title>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and represent a distinct class of MPDO RFPs from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.</description>

      <title>Lattice Dynamics of Energy Materials Investigated by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, I discuss several basic science studies in the field of energy materials using neutron scattering as a probe for the lattice dynamics. To enable understanding of neutron scattering spectra, I also use computational and theoretical methods. These methods and neutron scattering in general are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic quantum mechanics as well as with solid state physics topics including the band theory of electrons, harmonic lattice dynamics, and molecular dynamics. For the unfamiliar reader, the details of electronic structure theory and lattice dynamics that are needed to understand the methods in Chapter 2 are provided in Chapters 3 and 4. In the remaining chapters, these methods are applied to the study of several energy materials: cuprate La2CuO4,(hybrid) solar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and thermoelectric clathrate Ba8Ga16Ge30.</description>

      <title>Structural design and multiple magnetic orderings of the intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design, synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of a layered intergrowth compound, Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$. The structure of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ features an alternating arrangement of hexagonal EuCuP block layers and trigonal EuMn$_2$P$_2$ block layers, interconnected through shared Eu planes. This structural hybridization leads to multiple magnetic orderings in Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$: weak antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$ = 80 K, AFM ordering of Eu at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$ = 29 K, a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ = 14.5 K, and weak ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Mn}$. The spin configurations at different temperature regions were discussed based on the calculations of magnetic energies for various collinear arrangements. Resistivity measurements reveal a pronounced transition peak at $T_\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{Eu}$, which is suppressed in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in a significant negative magnetoresistance effect. The computed semimetallic band structure, characterized by a small density of states at the Fermi level, aligns well with experimental observations. The successful synthesis of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ and its fascinating magnetic properties highlight the effectiveness of our block-layer design strategy. By assembling magnetic block layers of compounds with compatible crystal symmetries and closely matched lattice parameters, this approach opens exciting avenues for discovering layered materials with unique magnetic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation for almost-bosonic anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\gamma$ which depends both on $\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\gamma=2\pi|\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the predictions we have found in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</description>

      <title>Locally Purified Density Operators for Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network approach known as the locally purified density operator (LPDO) to investigate the classification and characterization of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. We extend the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems, unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. We first illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by fermion parity symmetry, then extend the classification of ASPT phases to a general group extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</description>

      <title>Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in High Magnetic Fields: Quantum Criticality and Dimensional Reduction of a Sawtooth-Chain Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an extensive high-field study of atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, a material realization of quantum sawtooth chains with weak interchain couplings, in continuous and pulsed magnetic fields up to 58 T. In particular, we have mapped the entropy landscape for fields as high as 35 T and have identified a field-induced quantum critical point at 21.9(1) T for $\mathbf{H} \parallel c$ axis. The quantum critical point separates field regions with and without magnetic order, evidenced by our thermodynamic study and $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, but lies far below full saturation of the magnetization. Corroborated by numerical results using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we find this behavior associated with a dimensional reduction of the spin system: the sawtooth chain effectively decouples into an antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ chain (backbone of the sawtooth chain) in the presence of an exchange field produced by the remaining field-polarized spins.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable spin disordered phase in the triangular-lattice delafossite TlYbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice compound TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around ~ 30 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic characterisation of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterisation is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>
