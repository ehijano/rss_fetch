      <title>Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in CuxTiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Unified topological phase diagram of quantum Hall and superconducting vortex-lattice states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the global topological phase diagram of a two-dimensional electron gas placed in a quantizing magnetic field and proximitized by a superconducting vortex lattice. Our theory allows for arbitrary ratios of the pairing amplitude, magnetic field, and chemical potential. By analyzing the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian, we show that the resulting phase diagram is highly nontrivial, featuring a plethora of topological superconducting phases with chiral edge modes of quasiparticles. Landau-level mixing plays an essential role in our theory: even in the weak-pairing limit, it generically splits the integer quantum Hall transition lines into a sequence of transitions with larger Chern number jumps of both signs protected by the symmetries of the superconducting vortex lattice. Interestingly, we find that weak pairing induces trivial or topological superconductivity when chemical potential is tuned to a Landau level energy, depending on the Landau level index.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report an experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz Quantum Mechanics and Anisotropic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanics in spacetime with anisotropy in time. Such Lifshitz quantum mechanics is characterized by a kinetic term
  with fractional derivatives. We show that, contrary to a common claim in the literature, local conservation of probability is respected when
  the probability current is properly identified. As an application we consider a Josephson Junction with an insulating layer exhibiting
  Lifshitz anisotropy. We show that anisotropy modifies the tunneling rate and can significantly enhance the performance of the Josephson
  Junction.</description>
