      <title>List Decodable Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a construction of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes with near-optimal rate-distance tradeoff and efficient list decoding up to the Johnson bound in polynomial time. Previous constructions of list decodable good distance quantum codes either required access to a classical side channel or were based on algebraic constructions that preclude the LDPC property.
  Our construction relies on new algorithmic results for codes obtained via the quantum analog of the distance amplification scheme of Alon, Edmonds, and Luby [FOCS 1995]. These results are based on convex relaxations obtained using the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy, which reduce the problem of list decoding the distance amplified codes to unique decoding the starting base codes. Choosing these base codes to be the recent breakthrough constructions of good QLDPC codes with efficient unique decoders, we get efficiently list decodable QLDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Large Sets of Asymptotically Optimal and Near-Optimal Quasi-Complementary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect complementary sequence sets (PCSSs) are widely used in multi-carrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) communication system. However, the set size of a PCSS is upper bounded by the number of row sequences of each two-dimensional matrix in PCSS. Then quasi-complementary sequence set (QCSS) was proposed to support more users in MC-CDMA communications. For practical applications, it is desirable to construct an $(M,K,N,\vartheta_{max})$-QCSS with $M$ as large as possible and $\vartheta_{max}$ as small as possible, where $M$ is the number of matrices with $K$ rows and $N$ columns in the set and $\vartheta_{max}$ denotes its periodic tolerance. There exists a tradoff among these parameters and constructing QCSSs achieving or nearly achieving the known correlation lower bound has been an interesting research topic. Up to now, only a few constructions of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs were reported in the literature. In this paper, we construct five families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs with large set sizes and low periodic tolerances. These families of QCSSs have set size $\Theta(q^2)$ or $\Theta(q^3)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$, where $q$ is a power of a prime. To the best of our knowledge, only three known families of periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^2)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ were constructed and all other known periodic QCSSs have set sizes much smaller than $\Theta(q^2)$. Our new constructed periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^2)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ have better parameters than known ones. They have larger set sizes or lower periodic tolerances.The periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^3)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ constructed in this paper have the largest set size among all known families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonal codes from plateaued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-orthogonal codes are of interest as they have important applications in quantum codes, lattices and many areas. In this paper, based on the weakly regular plateaued functions or plateaued Boolean functions, we construct a family of linear codes with four nonzero weights. This family of linear codes is proved to be not only self-orthogonal but also optimally or almost optimally extendable. Besides, we derive binary and ternary linearly complementary dual codes (LCD codes for short) with new parameters from this family of codes. Some families of self-dual codes are also obtained as byproducts.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Space Shift Keying with Non-Ideal Transceivers and Greedy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and index modulation (IM) represent key technologies for enabling reliable wireless communication with high energy efficiency. However, to fully take advantage of these technologies in practical deployments, comprehending the impact of the non-ideal nature of the underlying transceivers is paramount. In this context, this paper introduces two RIS-assisted IM communication models, in which the RIS is part of the transmitter and space-shift keying (SSK) is employed for IM, and assesses their performance in the presence of hardware impairments. In the first model, the RIS acts as a passive reflector only, reflecting the oncoming SSK modulated signal intelligently towards the desired receive diversity branch/antenna. The second model employs RIS as a transmitter, employing M-ary phase-shift keying for reflection phase modulation (RPM), and as a reflector for the incoming SSK modulated signal. Considering transmissions subjected to Nakagami-m fading, and a greedy detection rule at the receiver, the performance of both the system configurations is evaluated. Specifically, the pairwise probability of erroneous index detection and the probability of erroneous index detection are adopted as performance metrics, and their closed-form expressions are derived for the RIS-assisted SSK and RIS-assisted SSK-RPM system models. Monte-Carlo simulation studies are carried out to verify the analytical framework, and numerical results are presented to study the dependency of the error performance on the system parameters. The findings highlight the effect of hardware impairment on the performance of the communication system under study.</description>

      <title>Global Optimal Closed-Form Solutions for Intelligent Surfaces With Mutual Coupling: Is Mutual Coupling Detrimental or Beneficial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a breakthrough technology enabling the dynamic control of the propagation environment in wireless communications through programmable surfaces. To improve the flexibility of conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has emerged as a family of more general RIS architectures. However, D-RIS and BD-RIS have been commonly explored neglecting mutual coupling effects, while the global optimization of RIS with mutual coupling, its performance limits, and scaling laws remain unexplored. This study addresses these gaps by deriving global optimal closed-form solutions for BD-RIS with mutual coupling to maximize the channel gain, specifically fully- and tree-connected RISs. Besides, we provide the expression of the maximum channel gain achievable in the presence of mutual coupling and its scaling law in closed form. By using the derived scaling laws, we analytically prove that mutual coupling increases the channel gain on average under Rayleigh fading channels. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that both fully- and tree-connected RISs with mutual coupling achieve the same channel gain upper bound when optimized with the proposed global optimal solutions. Furthermore, we observe that a mutual coupling-unaware optimization of RIS can cause a channel gain degradation of up to 5 dB.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quasi-Cyclic Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are an important component in the quest for quantum fault tolerance. Dramatic recent progress on qLDPC codes has led to constructions which are asymptotically good, and which admit linear-time decoders to correct errors affecting a constant fraction of codeword qubits. These constructions, while theoretically explicit, rely on inner codes with strong properties only shown to exist by probabilistic arguments, resulting in lengths that are too large to be practically relevant. In practice, the surface/toric codes, which are the product of two repetition codes, are still often the qLDPC codes of choice.
  A previous construction based on the lifted product of an expander-based classical LDPC code with a repetition code (Panteleev &amp; Kalachev, 2020) achieved a near-linear distance (of $\Omega(N/\log N)$ where $N$ is the number of codeword qubits), and avoids the need for such intractable inner codes. Our main result is an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes that corrects $\Theta(N/\log N)$ adversarial errors. En route, we give such an algorithm for the hypergraph product version these codes, which have weaker $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ distance (but are simpler). Our decoding algorithms leverage the fact that the codes we consider are quasi-cyclic, meaning that they respect a cyclic group symmetry.
  Since the repetition code is not based on expanders, previous approaches to decoding expander-based qLDPC codes, which typically worked by greedily flipping code bits to reduce some potential function, do not apply in our setting. Instead, we reduce our decoding problem (in a black-box manner) to that of decoding classical expander-based LDPC codes under noisy parity-check syndromes. For completeness, we also include a treatment of such classical noisy-syndrome decoding that is sufficient for our application to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Connectivity in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in 3GPP standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks. The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. In this article, we first introduce three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, e.g., cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Then, key technical challenges that severely influence the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed subsequently. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration in massive multiple-input-multiple-output systems. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters and propose a methodology to linearize the transmitters and perform the calibration by using mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that by only using the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers effectively. This allows to alleviate the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver characterization. Moreover, exploiting the results of the DPD linearization step, our calibration method may be formulated in terms of closed-form transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on costly iterative computations. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and calibration method.</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of large intelligent surface (LIS) with hardware distortion at its RX-chains. In particular, we consider the memory-less polynomial model for non-ideal hardware and derive analytical expressions for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the LIS. We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. We also study the cost of assuming ideal hardware by analyzing the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with a non-ideal hardware. Then, we exploit the analytical expressions to propose optimized antenna selection schemes for LIS and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly. In particular, the antenna selection schemes allow the LIS to have lower number of non-ideal RX-chains for signal reception while maintaining a good performance. We also consider a more practical case where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Polar Maximum Likelihood Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional decoding algorithms for polar codes strive to balance achievable performance and computational complexity in classical computing. While maximum likelihood (ML) decoding guarantees optimal performance, its NP-hard nature makes it impractical for real-world systems. In this letter, we propose a novel ML decoding architecture for polar codes based on the Grover adaptive search, a quantum exhaustive search algorithm. Unlike conventional studies, our approach, enabled by a newly formulated objective function, uniquely supports Gray-coded multi-level modulation without expanding the search space size compared to the classical ML decoding. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed quantum decoding achieves ML performance while providing a pure quadratic speedup in query complexity.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Multi-Level Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have demonstrated that embedding a few bits of payload in each spike exchanged between the spiking neurons can further enhance inference accuracy. In a split computing architecture, where the SNN is divided across two separate devices, the device storing the first layers must share information about the spikes generated by the local output neurons with the other device. Consequently, the advantages of multi-level spikes must be balanced against the challenges of transmitting additional bits between the two devices.
  This paper addresses these challenges by investigating a wireless neuromorphic split computing architecture employing multi-level SNNs. For this system, we present the design of digital and analog modulation schemes optimized for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios provide insights into the performance gains of multi-level SNN models and the optimal payload size as a function of the quality of the connection between a transmitter and receiver.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation With Shorter Pilots in RIS-Aided Communications: Using Array Geometries and Interference Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the cascaded channel from a user equipment (UE) to a base station (BS) via each reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) element is critical to realizing the full potential of the RIS's ability to control the overall channel. The number of parameters to be estimated is equal to the number of RIS elements, requiring an equal number of pilots unless an underlying structure can be identified. In this paper, we show how the spatial correlation inherent in the different RIS channels provides this desired structure. We first optimize the RIS phase-shift pattern using a much-reduced pilot length (determined by the rank of the spatial correlation matrices) to minimize the mean square error (MSE) in the channel estimation under electromagnetic interference. In addition to considering the linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) channel estimator, we propose a novel channel estimator that requires only knowledge of the array geometry while not requiring any user-specific statistical information. We call this the reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimator and optimize the RIS phase-shift pattern for it. This novel estimator significantly outperforms the conventional LS estimator. For both the LMMSE and RS-LS estimators, the proposed optimized RIS configurations result in significant channel estimation improvements over the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of Error Correcting Codes with no predetermined length. An Unbounded ECC with rate $R$ and distance $\varepsilon$ is an encoding of a possibly infinite message into a possibly infinite codeword, such that for every large enough $k$ we may recover the first $Rk$ symbols of the message from the first $k$ symbols of the codeword -- even when up to $\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon k$ of these codeword symbols are adversarially corrupted. We study unbounded codes over a binary alphabet in the regime of small distance $\varepsilon$, and obtain nearly-tight upper and lower bounds in several natural settings. We show that the optimal rate of such a code is between $R&lt;1-\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ and $R&gt;1-O\left(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\log\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}\right)$. Surprisingly, our construction is non-linear, and we show that the optimal rate of a linear unbounded code is the asymptotically worse $R=1-\Theta\left(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}\right)$. In the setting of random noise, the optimal rate of unbounded codes improves and matches the rate of standard codes at $R=1-\Theta({\varepsilon\log{\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}})$.</description>

Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal random covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Convergence efficiency of quantum gates and circuits</title>

Abstract: We consider quantum circuit models where the gates are drawn from arbitrary gate ensembles given by probabilistic distributions over certain gate sets and circuit architectures, which we call stochastic quantum circuits. Of main interest in this work is the speed of convergence of stochastic circuits with different gate ensembles and circuit architectures to unitary t-designs. A key motivation for this theory is the varying preference for different gates and circuit architectures in different practical scenarios. In particular, it provides a versatile framework for devising efficient circuits for implementing $t$-designs and relevant applications including random circuit and scrambling experiments, as well as benchmarking the performance of gates and circuit architectures. We examine various important settings in depth. A key aspect of our study is an "ironed gadget" model, which allows us to systematically evaluate and compare the convergence efficiency of entangling gates and circuit architectures. Particularly notable results include i) gadgets of two-qubit gates with KAK coefficients $\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5}),\frac{\pi}{8},\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5})\right)$ (which we call $\chi$ gates) directly form exact 2- and 3-designs; ii) the iSWAP gate family achieves the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs under mild conjectures with numerical evidence, even outperforming the Haar-random gate, for generic many-body circuits; iii) iSWAP + complete graph achieve the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs among all graph circuits. A variety of numerical results are provided to complement our analysis. We also derive robustness guarantees for our analysis against gate perturbations. Additionally, we provide cursory analysis on gates with higher locality and found that the Margolus gate outperforms various other well-known gates.</description>

      <title>Which bits went where? Past and future transfer entropy decomposition with the information bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the system under study is a shoal of fish, a collection of neurons, or a set of interacting atmospheric and oceanic processes, transfer entropy measures the flow of information between time series and can detect possible causal relationships. Much like mutual information, transfer entropy is generally reported as a single value summarizing an amount of shared variation, yet a more fine-grained accounting might illuminate much about the processes under study. Here we propose to decompose transfer entropy and localize the bits of variation on both sides of information flow: that of the originating process's past and that of the receiving process's future. We employ the information bottleneck (IB) to compress the time series and identify the transferred entropy. We apply our method to decompose the transfer entropy in several synthetic recurrent processes and an experimental mouse dataset of concurrent behavioral and neural activity. Our approach highlights the nuanced dynamics within information flow, laying a foundation for future explorations into the intricate interplay of temporal processes in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Coded Many-User Multiple Access via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Based Active User Enumeration for Grant-Free Access Under Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) system in the presence of carrier frequency offsets. We propose two schemes for enumerating active users in such a GF-NOMA system, which is equivalent to estimating the sparsity level. Both schemes utilize a short common pilot and the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. The two schemes differ in their treatment of noise variance: one exploits known variance information, while the other is designed to function without this knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of the normalized root-mean-squared error.</description>

      <title>Injectivity, stability, and positive definiteness of max filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a real inner product space V and a group G of linear isometries, max filtering offers a rich class of G-invariant maps. In this paper, we identify nearly sharp conditions under which these maps injectively embed the orbit space V/G into Euclidean space, and when G is finite, we estimate the map's distortion of the quotient metric. We also characterize when max filtering is a positive definite kernel.</description>

      <title>RIS in Cellular Networks -- Challenges and Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been suggested to be a key 6G feature and was suggested to be considered as a study-item in both 3GPP Releases 18 and 19. However, in both releases, it has been decided not to continue with it as a study-item, and to leave it for possible future specification. In this paper, we present the rationale for such a decision. Particularly, we demonstrate the practical issues which may affect the feasibility or usefulness of RIS in cellular networks, and present open problems to be addressed before RIS can be used in practice. Moreover, we compare the performance of RIS with network-controlled repeater, the node with the most similar characteristics to RIS and which has been standardized in 3GPP Release 18. Finally, different simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of RIS-assisted networks.</description>
