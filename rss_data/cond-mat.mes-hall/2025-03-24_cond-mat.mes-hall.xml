      <title>Electronic structure of a layered altermagnetic compound CoNb4Se8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in altermagnetism, a novel form of magnetism, characterized by unique spin-splitting even in the absence of both net magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling. Despite numerous theoretical predictions, experimental evidence of such spin-splitting in real materials remains limited. In this study, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic band structure of the altermagnet candidate CoNb4Se8. This material features an ordered sublattice of intercalated Co atoms within NbSe2 layers. Magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements reveal the onset of antiferromagnetism below 168 K. Temperature dependent ARPES data, supported by DFT calculations, uncover spin split bands along the MGM high-symmetry direction. The observation of spin splitting in this high temperature altermagnet opens new avenues for exploring its electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Entropy of strongly correlated electrons in a partially filled Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-resolution chemical potential measurements to extract the entropy of monolayer and bilayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime via the Maxwell relation $\left.\frac{d\mu}{dT}\right|_N = -\left.\frac{dS}{dN}\right|_T$. Measuring the entropy from $T=300$K down to $T=200$mK, we identify the sequential emergence of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, fractional quantum Hall states (FQH), and various charge orders by comparing the measured entropy in different temperature regimes with theoretical models. At the lowest temperature of $T \approx 200$mK we perform a detailed study of the entropy near even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene, and comment on the possible topological origin of the observed excess entropy.</description>

      <title>Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian approach for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>A formally exact real-space representation of the Berry phase on infinite lattices: Applications to dipole and quadrupole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Kitaev's real-space representation of Chern numbers, we develop a real-space formulation of the Berry phase for infinite lattices. While the well-known Resta formula for the Berry phase is defined under periodic boundary conditions for finite lattices, our approach constructs the Berry phase directly on an infinite lattice without requiring momentum-space discretization. We apply this method to several disordered models to examine its validity. Furthermore, we attempt to generalize the real-space representation to the quadrupole moment, drawing an analogy to the generalization of the Resta formula for the quadrupole moment.</description>

      <title>Anyon braiding on the single edge of a fractional quantum Hall state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional statistics, bridging between fermions and bosons. We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source. The setup involves an droplet along a fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, formed by defining a droplet with two negatively biased gates. In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.</description>

      <title>High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Gate and Carriers tunable Valley Imbalance in Topological Proximitized Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure, Fermi surface topology and the emergence of valley imbalance in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) induced by the topological proximity and the electric fields. We show that, a strong proximity strength isolates the unperturbed low energy bands at the charge neutrality and the isolated topological bands show metallic nature under the influence of applied electric fields. Our calculations indicate that valley-resolved metallic states with a finite Chern number $|C| =$3 can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate electric fields and second-nearest-neighbor strengths. The Fermi surface topology of these metallic bands greatly influenced by the applied electric fields and carrier doping. The valley imbalance lead to the dominant carriers of either $e^-$ or $h^+$ Fermi surface pockets and the choice of carriers is subjected to the direction of electric fields. The gate-tunable and carrier-induced valley imbalance in topologically proximated rhombohedral trilayer graphene may have potential applications toward the realization of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Hearing the shape of a Dirac drum: Dual quantum Hall states on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of a physical system is intimately related to its spectral properties, a concept colloquially referred to as "hearing the shape of a drum". Three-dimensional topological insulator nanowires in a strong magnetic field $B$ generally host Dirac-type quantum Hall (QH) surface states. The surface itself is shaped by spatial variations of the wires' cross section, yielding a curved geometrical background, the "drum", with imprints in the corresponding QH spectra. We show that the latter are composed of two different classes. The first one is asymptotically insensitive to the surface shape, scaling as $B^{1/2}$, like regular planar QH states. Instead, the second has an asymptotic $B$-field dependence intimately related to the wire geometry. We further demonstrate that an (axial-symmetric) curved nanowire surface possesses a reciprocal partner surface, such that the respective QH spectra are dual to each other upon exchanging angular momentum and magnetic flux. Notably, a cone-shaped nanowire, and the Corbino geometry as its limiting case, has a reciprocal partner with a dual QH spectrum that is $B$-field independent, with corresponding non-magnetic QH-type states. We support our analytical findings by numerical results for $B$-field ranges and wire geometries within reach of current experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced shot noise in graphene quantum point contacts with electrostatic reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shot noise measurements in quantum point contacts are a powerful tool to investigate charge transport in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regime, in particular to unveil the charge, quantum statistics and tunneling dynamics of edge excitations. In this letter, we describe shot noise measurements in a graphene quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime. At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact. We show that the presence of this quantum dot leads to a $50-100~\%$ increase in the shot noise, which we attribute to correlated charge tunneling. Our results highlight the role played by the electrostatic environment in those graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Graphene Straintronics by Molecular Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report on controlling strain in graphene by trapping molecules at the graphene-substrate interface, leveraging molecular dipole moments. Spectroscopic and transport measurements show that strain correlates with the dipole moments of trapped molecules, with a dipole range of 1.5 D to 4.9 D resulting in a 50-fold increase in strain and a substantial rise in the residual carrier density. This has been possible by charge transfer between graphene and trapped molecules, altering the C=C bond length, and causing biaxial strain. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm a consistent dependence of bending height on molecular dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled by Heat Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study laser-induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effect of a direct laser excitation and an ultrashort hot-electron pulse. A wedged Cu layer is grown on top of the spin valve in order to tune the energy transmission to the magnetic stack, for both optical and hot-electron pulses. We demonstrate single-pulse magnetization reversal of the free layer by a hot-electron pulse. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. These results suggest that free layer heating plays a significant role in magnetization reversal. This work contributes to the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal due to nonlocal heat and spin transport occurring under strongly out-of-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent giant orbital moments and transport feature in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a great interest in orbital related electronics (also termed as orbitronics). In the current work, we present a first-principles density functional theory calculation on the orbital magnetic moments, intrinsic orbital Hall effect, and ordinary magnetoconductivity effects in rhombohedral graphene multilayers. Our calculations suggest a giant orbital moment that arises from inter-atomic cycloid motion, reaching over 30 muB under an intermediate gate voltage. This leads to a valley polarization under an external magnetic field, as observed in recent experiments [Nature 623, 41-47 (2023)]. In addition, the orbital-related transport feature exhibit significant responses that are potentially observed in experiments. We also suggest that under a periodic field driven (such as high frequency light field), the ungated graphene multilayers could host strong quantum anomalous and orbital Hall effects, engineered by the layer number. As the graphene multilayers are intrinsically nonmagnetic with negligible spin-orbit coupling, the orbital moments would not be entangled by spin-related signals. Thus, they serve as an ideal platform to conduct orbitronic measurements and utilization for next generation information read/write nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Topological blocking at the Bi(111) surface due to surface relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of Bi and its alloys with Sb have fueled intense debate since the prediction of three-dimensional topological insulators. However, a definitive resolution has not been reached to date. Here, we provide theoretical evidence that surface relaxation conceals the underlying bulk topology of pure Bi. Using density functional theory calculations for thin Bi(111) films (up to 17 bilayers), we first demonstrate a substantial inter-bilayer expansion near the surface. Motivated by this finding, we extend our analysis to thick Bi(111) films (up to 250 bilayers) incorporating relaxation layers, within the framework of a relativistic empirical tight-binding model. Our results reveal that these relaxation layers topologically block the emergence of surface state and significantly suppress the one-particle spectrum of surface states, thereby obscuring the experimental identification of Bi's topological properties. This phenomenon, which we term "topological blocking", provides crucial insights into the long-standing difficulty of observing surface states of Bi(111) at the $\bar{M}$ point. Furthermore, it establishes a framework for understanding and predicting the topological behavior in systems where surface relaxation disrupts the bulk-edge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Prospects to bypass nonlocal phenomena in metals using phonon-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic design relies on an accurate understanding of light-matter interactions, yet often overlooks electronic length scales. Under extreme confinement, this omission can lead to nonclassical effects, such as nonlocal response. Here, we use mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) screened by monocrystalline gold flakes to push the limits of nanolight confinement unobstructed by nonlocal phenomena, even when the polariton phase velocity approaches the Fermi velocities of electrons in gold. We employ near-field imaging to probe polaritons in nanometre-thin crystals of hBN on gold and extract their complex propagation constant, observing effective indices exceeding 90. We further show the importance of sample characterisation by revealing a thin low-index interfacial layer naturally forming on monocrystalline gold. Our experiments address a fundamental limitation posed by nonlocal effects in van der Waals heterostructures and outline a pathway to bypass their impact in high-confinement regimes.</description>

Abstract: With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.</description>

      <title>PINK: physical-informed machine learning for lattice thermal conductivity</title>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial for efficient thermal management in electronics and energy conversion technologies. Traditional methods for predicting \k{appa}L are often computationally expensive, limiting their scalability for large-scale material screening. Empirical models, such as the Slack model, offer faster alternatives but require time-consuming calculations for key parameters such as sound velocity and the Gruneisen parameter. This work presents a high-throughput framework, physical-informed kappa (PINK), which combines the predictive power of crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) with the physical interpretability of the Slack model to predict \k{appa}L directly from crystallographic information files (CIFs). Unlike previous approaches, PINK enables rapid, batch predictions by extracting material properties such as bulk and shear modulus from CIFs using a well-trained CGCNN model. These properties are then used to compute the necessary parameters for $\kappa_L$ calculation through a simplified physical formula. PINK was applied to a dataset of 377,221 stable materials, enabling the efficient identification of promising candidates with ultralow $\kappa_L$ values, such as Ag$_3$Te$_4$W and Ag$_3$Te$_4$Ta. The platform, accessible via a user-friendly interface, offers an unprecedented combination of speed, accuracy, and scalability, significantly accelerating material discovery for thermal management and energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication Optimization of van der Waals Metasurfaces: Inverse Patterning Boosts Resonance Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials have garnered growing interest for use as nanophotonic building blocks that offer precise control over light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, such as optical metasurfaces hosting sharp quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances. However, traditional fabrication strategies often rely on lift-off processes, which inherently introduce imperfections in resonator shape and size distribution, ultimately limiting the resonance performance. Here, an optimized fabrication approach for vdW-metasurfaces is presented that implements inverse patterning of the etching mask, resulting in increased resonator quality solely limited by the resolution of the electron beam lithography resist and etching. Applying this inverse fabrication technique on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), quality (Q) factors exceeding $10^3$ in the visible spectral range were demonstrated, significantly surpassing previous results shown by lift-off fabricated structures. Additionally, the platforms potential as a biosensor was displayed, achieving competitive sensitivity and figure of merit of 220 in a refractive index sensing experiment. The inverse technique was applied to create chiral metasurfaces from hBN, using a two-height resonator geometry to achieve up to 50 % transmittance selectivity. This inverse lithography technique paves the way towards high-performances vdW-devices with high-Q resonances, establishing hBN as a cornerstone for next-generation nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensors from sub-bundle geometry</title>

Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on an arbitrary connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by a generalization of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor, which contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution</title>

Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mass generation on two-dimensional electronic hyperbolic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free electrons hopping on hyperbolic lattices embedded on a negatively curved space can foster (a) Dirac liquids, (b) Fermi liquids, and (c) flat bands, respectively characterized by a vanishing, constant, and divergent density of states near the half filling. From numerical self-consistent mean-field Hartree analyses, we show that nearest-neighbor Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions respectively give rise to charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic orders featuring staggered patterns of average electronic density and magnetization in all these systems, when the hyperbolic tessellation is accomplished by periodic arrangements of even $p$-gons. Both quantum orders dynamically open mass gaps near the charge neutrality point via spontaneous symmetry breaking. Only on hyperbolic Dirac materials these orderings take place via quantum phase transitions (QPTs) beyond critical interactions, which however decrease with increasing curvature, showcasing curvature-induced weak-coupling QPTs. We present scaling of these masses with the corresponding interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>
