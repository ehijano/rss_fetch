      <title>PolyKAN: Efficient Fused GPU Operators for Polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) promise higher expressive capability and stronger interpretability than Multi-Layer Perceptron, particularly in the domain of AI for Science. However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based, Distributed Memory, Modeling Abstraction for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general, flexible modeling abstraction for building and working with distributed optimization problems called a RemoteOptiGraph. This abstraction extends the OptiGraph model in Plasmo$.$jl, where optimization problems are represented as hypergraphs with nodes that define modular subproblems (variables, constraints, and objectives) and edges that encode algebraic linking constraints between nodes. The RemoteOptiGraph allows OptiGraphs to be utilized in distributed memory environments through InterWorkerEdges, which manage linking constraints that span workers. This abstraction offers a unified approach for modeling optimization problems on distributed memory systems (avoiding bespoke modeling approaches), and provides a basis for developing general-purpose meta-algorithms that can exploit distributed memory structure such as Benders or Lagrangian decompositions. We implement this abstraction in the open-source package, Plasmo$.$jl and we illustrate how it can be used by solving a mixed integer capacity expansion model for the western United States containing over 12 million variables and constraints. The RemoteOptiGraph abstraction together with Benders decomposition performs 7.5 times faster than solving the same problem without decomposition.</description>

      <title>GPU-Initiated Networking for NCCL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.
  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.</description>

      <title>BlueBottle: Fast and Robust Blockchains through Subsystem Specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f&lt;3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.</description>

      <title>Multiple Sides of 36 Coins: Measuring Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Across Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems, and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.
  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.</description>

      <title>When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.</description>

      <title>Proving there is a leader without naming it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local certification is a mechanism for certifying to the nodes of a network that a certain property holds. In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.
  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).
  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $\Theta(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]</description>

      <title>GeoShield: Byzantine Fault Detection and Recovery for Geo-Distributed Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as railway control systems and smart grids, consist of geographically distributed subsystems that are connected via unreliable, asynchronous inter-region networks. Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.
  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formal Verification of Secure Vehicle Software Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.
  Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Compiler for Processing-In-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) devices integrated with high-performance Host processors (e.g., GPUs) can accelerate memory-intensive kernels in Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by leveraging high memory bandwidth at PIM cores. However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.</description>

      <title>Beluga: Block Synchronization for BFT Consensus Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput BFT consensus protocols use streamlined push-pull mechanisms to disseminate blocks and keep happy-path performance optimal. Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.</description>

Abstract: General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) computing plays a transformative role in deep learning and machine learning by leveraging the computational advantages of parallel processing. Through the power of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), GPUs enable the efficient execution of complex tasks via massive parallelism. This work explores CPU and GPU architectures, data flow in deep learning, and advanced GPU features, including streams, concurrency, and dynamic parallelism. The applications of GPGPU span scientific computing, machine learning acceleration, real-time rendering, and cryptocurrency mining. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate parallel architectures, such as GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs, and ASICs, tailored to specific computational tasks and optimizing algorithms for these platforms. Practical examples using popular frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost demonstrate how to maximize GPU efficiency for training and inference tasks. This resource serves as a comprehensive guide for both beginners and experienced practitioners, offering insights into GPU-based parallel computing and its critical role in advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Minimmit: Fast Finality with Even Faster Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency consensus in geographically distributed systems remains a key challenge for blockchain and distributed database applications. To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting).
  We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Long-context LLM Serving via Fine-grained Sequence Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their context windows have rapidly expanded. To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.
  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, Tetris achieves up to 4.35$\times$ lower time-to-first-token (TTFT) under max sustainable loads, reduces median time-between-tokens (TBT) by up to 40.1\%, and increases the max request capacity by up to 45\%.</description>

      <title>Harli: SLO-Aware Co-location of LLM Inference and PEFT-based Finetuning on Model-as-a-Service Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed under the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized.
  We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.</description>

      <title>Resource-Constrained Decentralized Federated Learning via Personalized Event-Triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular technique for distributing machine learning (ML) across a set of edge devices. In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\ln{k} / \sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Constructive community race: full-density spiking neural network model drives neuromorphic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local circuitry of the mammalian brain is a focus of the search for generic computational principles because it is largely conserved across species and modalities. In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\,\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE</description>
