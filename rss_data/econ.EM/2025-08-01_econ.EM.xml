      <title>Relative Bias Under Imperfect Identification in Observational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To conduct causal inference in observational settings, researchers must rely on certain identifying assumptions. In practice, these assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. This paper considers the bias of selection-on-observables, instrumental variables, and proximal inference estimates under violations of their identifying assumptions. We develop bias expressions for IV and proximal inference that show how violations of their respective assumptions are amplified by any unmeasured confounding in the outcome variable. We propose a set of sensitivity tools that quantify the sensitivity of different identification strategies, and an augmented bias contour plot visualizes the relationship between these strategies. We argue that the act of choosing an identification strategy implicitly expresses a belief about the degree of violations that must be present in alternative identification strategies. Even when researchers intend to conduct an IV or proximal analysis, a sensitivity analysis comparing different identification strategies can help to better understand the implications of each set of assumptions. Throughout, we compare the different approaches on a re-analysis of the impact of state surveillance on the incidence of protest in Communist Poland.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and Interpretation of Treatment Effects in Settings with Delayed Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11505v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies settings where the analyst is interested in identifying and estimating the average \emph{direct} causal effect of a binary treatment on an outcome. We consider a setup in which the outcome realization does not get immediately realized after the treatment assignment, a feature that is ubiquitous in empirical settings. The period between the treatment and the realization of the outcome allows other observed actions to occur and affect the outcome. In this context, we study several regression-based estimands routinely used in empirical work to capture the average treatment effect and shed light on interpreting them in terms of ceteris paribus effects, indirect causal effects, and selection terms. We obtain three main and related takeaways under a common set of assumptions. First, the three most popular estimands do not generally satisfy what we call \emph{strong sign preservation}, in the sense that these estimands may be negative even when the treatment positively affects the outcome conditional on any possible combination of other actions. Second, the most popular regression that includes the other actions as controls satisfies strong sign preservation \emph{if and only if} these actions are mutually exclusive binary variables. Finally, we show that a linear regression that fully stratifies the other actions leads to estimands that satisfy strong sign preservation.</description>

      <title>Identification of Impulse Response Functions for Nonlinear Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the issues of identification for nonlinear Impulse Response Functions in nonlinear dynamic models and discuss the settings in which the problem can be mitigated. In particular, we introduce the nonlinear autoregressive representation with Gaussian innovations and characterize the identified set. This set arises from the multiplicity of nonlinear innovations and transformations which leave invariant the standard normal density. We then discuss possible identifying restrictions, such as non-Gaussianity of independent sources, or identifiable parameters by means of learning algorithms, and the possibility of identification in nonlinear dynamic factor models when the underlying latent factors have different dynamics. We also explain how these identification results depend ultimately on the set of series under consideration.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Stochastic Block Model for Multidimensional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of relational data can offer new insights into the functioning of the economy. Nevertheless, modeling the dynamics in network data with multiple types of relationships is still a challenging issue. Stochastic block models provide a parsimonious and flexible approach to network analysis. We propose a new stochastic block model for multidimensional networks, where layer-specific hidden Markov-chain processes drive the changes in community formation. The changes in the block membership of a node in a given layer may be influenced by its own past membership in other layers. This allows for clustering overlap, clustering decoupling, or more complex relationships between layers, including settings of unidirectional, or bidirectional, non-linear Granger block causality. We address the overparameterization issue of a saturated specification by assuming a Multi-Laplacian prior distribution within a Bayesian framework. Data augmentation and Gibbs sampling are used to make the inference problem more tractable. Through simulations, we show that standard linear models and the pairwise approach are unable to detect block causality in most scenarios. In contrast, our model can recover the true Granger causality structure. As an application to international trade, we show that our model offers a unified framework, encompassing community detection and Gravity equation modeling. We found new evidence of block Granger causality of trade agreements and flows and core-periphery structure in both layers on a large sample of countries.</description>
