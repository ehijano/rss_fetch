      <title>Cross-attention Inspired Selective State Space Models for Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer model, particularly its cross-attention module, is widely used for feature fusion in target sound extraction which extracts the signal of interest based on given clues. Despite its effectiveness, this approach suffers from low computational efficiency. Recent advancements in state space models, notably the latest work Mamba, have shown comparable performance to Transformer-based methods while significantly reducing computational complexity in various tasks. However, Mamba's applicability in target sound extraction is limited due to its inability to capture dependencies between different sequences as the cross-attention does. In this paper, we propose CrossMamba for target sound extraction, which leverages the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba to compute dependencies between the given clues and the audio mixture. The calculation of Mamba can be divided to the query, key and value. We utilize the clue to generate the query and the audio mixture to derive the key and value, adhering to the principle of the cross-attention mechanism in Transformers. Experimental results from two representative target sound extraction methods validate the efficacy of the proposed CrossMamba.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Moving Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</description>

      <title>Exploring WavLM Back-ends for Speech Spoofing and Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes our submitted systems to the ASVspoof 5 Challenge Track 1: Speech Deepfake Detection - Open Condition, which consists of a stand-alone speech deepfake (bonafide vs spoof) detection task. Recently, large-scale self-supervised models become a standard in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other speech processing tasks. Thus, we leverage a pre-trained WavLM as a front-end model and pool its representations with different back-end techniques. The complete framework is fine-tuned using only the trained dataset of the challenge, similar to the close condition. Besides, we adopt data-augmentation by adding noise and reverberation using MUSAN noise and RIR datasets. We also experiment with codec augmentations to increase the performance of our method. Ultimately, we use the Bosaris toolkit for score calibration and system fusion to get better Cllr scores. Our fused system achieves 0.0937 minDCF, 3.42% EER, 0.1927 Cllr, and 0.1375 actDCF.</description>

      <title>TF-Mamba: A Time-Frequency Network for Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) determines the position of sound sources using multi-channel audio data. It is commonly used to improve speech enhancement and separation. Extracting spatial features is crucial for SSL, especially in challenging acoustic environments. Previous studies performed well based on long short-term memory models. Recently, a novel scalable SSM referred to as Mamba demonstrated notable performance across various sequence-based modalities, including audio and speech. This study introduces the Mamba for SSL tasks. We consider the Mamba-based model to analyze spatial features from speech signals by fusing both time and frequency features, and we develop an SSL system called TF-Mamba. This system integrates time and frequency fusion, with Bidirectional Mamba managing both time-wise and frequency-wise processing. We conduct the experiments on the simulated dataset and the LOCATA dataset. Experiments show that TF-Mamba significantly outperforms other advanced methods on simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement with Schr\"odinger Bridge and Symmetric Noise Schedule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech enhancement tasks. However, these methods still encounter challenges, including the lack of structural information and poor performance in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Schr\"oodinger Bridge-based Speech Enhancement (SBSE) method, which learns the diffusion processes directly between the noisy input and the clean distribution, unlike conventional diffusion-based speech enhancement systems that learn data to Gaussian distributions. To enhance performance in extremely noisy conditions, we introduce a two-stage system incorporating ratio mask information into the diffusion-based generative model. Our experimental results show that our proposed SBSE method outperforms all the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in low SNR conditions. Importantly, only a few inference steps are required to achieve the best result.</description>

      <title>SS-BRPE: Self-Supervised Blind Room Parameter Estimation Using Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, dynamic parameterization of acoustic environments has garnered attention in audio processing. This focus includes room volume and reverberation time (RT60), which define local acoustics independent of sound source and receiver orientation. Previous studies show that purely attention-based models can achieve advanced results in room parameter estimation. However, their success relies on supervised pretrainings that require a large amount of labeled true values for room parameters and complex training pipelines. In light of this, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Blind Room Parameter Estimation (SS-BRPE) system. This system combines a purely attention-based model with self-supervised learning to estimate room acoustic parameters, from single-channel noisy speech signals. By utilizing unlabeled audio data for pretraining, the proposed system significantly reduces dependencies on costly labeled datasets. Our model also incorporates dynamic feature augmentation during fine-tuning to enhance adaptability and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that the SS-BRPE system not only achieves more superior performance in estimating room parameters than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also effectively maintains high accuracy under conditions with limited labeled data.

      <title>BigCodec: Pushing the Limits of Low-Bitrate Neural Speech Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BigCodec, a low-bitrate neural speech codec. While recent neural speech codecs have shown impressive progress, their performance significantly deteriorates at low bitrates (around 1 kbps). Although a low bitrate inherently restricts performance, other factors, such as model capacity, also hinder further improvements. To address this problem, we scale up the model size to 159M parameters that is more than 10 times larger than popular codecs with about 10M parameters. Besides, we integrate sequential models into traditional convolutional architectures to better capture temporal dependency and adopt low-dimensional vector quantization to ensure a high code utilization. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations show that BigCodec, with a bitrate of 1.04 kbps, significantly outperforms several existing low-bitrate codecs. Furthermore, BigCodec achieves objective performance comparable to popular codecs operating at 4-6 times higher bitrates, and even delivers better subjective perceptual quality than the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Findings of the 2024 Mandarin Stuttering Event Detection and Automatic Speech Recognition Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The StutteringSpeech Challenge focuses on advancing speech technologies for people who stutter, specifically targeting Stuttering Event Detection (SED) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Mandarin. The challenge comprises three tracks: (1) SED, which aims to develop systems for detection of stuttering events; (2) ASR, which focuses on creating robust systems for recognizing stuttered speech; and (3) Research track for innovative approaches utilizing the provided dataset. We utilizes an open-source Mandarin stuttering dataset AS-70, which has been split into new training and test sets for the challenge. This paper presents the dataset, details the challenge tracks, and analyzes the performance of the top systems, highlighting improvements in detection accuracy and reductions in recognition error rates. Our findings underscore the potential of specialized models and augmentation strategies in developing stuttered speech technologies.</description>

      <title>NTT Multi-Speaker ASR System for the DASR Task of CHiME-8 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a distant automatic speech recognition (DASR) system developed for the CHiME-8 DASR track. It consists of a diarization first pipeline. For diarization, we use end-to-end diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC) followed by target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) refinement. To deal with various numbers of speakers, we developed a new multi-channel speaker counting approach. We then apply guided source separation (GSS) with several improvements to the baseline system. Finally, we perform ASR using a combination of systems built from strong pre-trained models. Our proposed system achieves a macro tcpWER of 21.3 % on the dev set, which is a 57 % relative improvement over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Content and Acoustic Representations for Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER), the task of identifying the expression of emotion from spoken content, is challenging due to the difficulty in extracting representations that capture emotional attributes from speech. The scarcity of large labeled datasets further complicates the challenge where large models are prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose CARE (Content and Acoustic Representations of Emotions), where we design a dual encoding scheme which emphasizes semantic and acoustic factors of speech. While the semantic encoder is trained with the distillation of utterance-level text representation model, the acoustic encoder is trained to predict low-level frame-wise features of the speech signal. The proposed dual encoding scheme is a base-sized model trained only on unsupervised raw speech. With a simple light-weight classification model trained on the downstream task, we show that the CARE embeddings provide effective emotion recognition on a variety of tasks. We compare the proposal with several other self-supervised models as well as recent large-language model based approaches. In these evaluations, the proposed CARE model is shown to be the best performing model based on average performance across 8 diverse datasets. We also conduct several ablation studies to analyze the importance of various design choices.</description>

      <title>An investigation of modularity for noise robustness in conformer-based ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst state of the art automatic speech recognition (ASR) can perform well, it still degrades when exposed to acoustic environments that differ from those used when training the model. Unfamiliar environments for a given model may well be known a-priori, but yield comparatively small amounts of adaptation data. In this experimental study, we investigate to what extent recent formalisations of modularity can aid adaptation of ASR to new acoustic environments. Using a conformer based model and fixed routing, we confirm that environment awareness can indeed lead to improved performance in known environments. However, at least on the (CHIME) datasets in the study, it is difficult for a classifier module to distinguish different noisy environments, a simpler distinction between noisy and clean speech being the optimal configuration. The results have clear implications for deploying large models in particular environments with or without a-priori knowledge of the environmental noise.</description>

      <title>Longer is (Not Necessarily) Stronger: Punctuated Long-Sequence Training for Enhanced Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for training sequence-to-sequence models for speech recognition and translation tasks. Instead of the traditional approach of training models on short segments containing only lowercase or partial punctuation and capitalization (PnC) sentences, we propose training on longer utterances that include complete sentences with proper punctuation and capitalization. We achieve this by using the FastConformer architecture which allows training 1 Billion parameter models with sequences up to 60 seconds long with full attention. However, while training with PnC enhances the overall performance, we observed that accuracy plateaus when training on sequences longer than 40 seconds across various evaluation settings. Our proposed method significantly improves punctuation and capitalization accuracy, showing a 25% relative word error rate (WER) improvement on the Earnings-21 and Earnings-22 benchmarks. Additionally, training on longer audio segments increases the overall model accuracy across speech recognition and translation benchmarks. The model weights and training code are open-sourced though NVIDIA NeMo.</description>

      <title>AS-Speech: Adaptive Style For Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis technology, enabling the high-quality synthesis of voices in common scenarios. In unseen situations, adaptive TTS requires a strong generalization capability to speaker style characteristics. However, the existing adaptive methods can only extract and integrate coarse-grained timbre or mixed rhythm attributes separately. In this paper, we propose AS-Speech, an adaptive style methodology that integrates the speaker timbre characteristics and rhythmic attributes into a unified framework for text-to-speech synthesis. Specifically, AS-Speech can accurately simulate style characteristics through fine-grained text-based timbre features and global rhythm information, and achieve high-fidelity speech synthesis through the diffusion model. Experiments show that the proposed model produces voices with higher naturalness and similarity in terms of timbre and rhythm compared to a series of adaptive TTS models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular toolkit to perform joint speaker diarization and speaker identification. The toolkit can leverage on multiple models and algorithms which are defined in a configuration file. Such flexibility allows our system to work properly in various conditions (e.g., multiple registered speakers' sets, acoustic conditions and languages) and across application domains (e.g. media monitoring, institutional, speech analytics). In this demonstration we show a practical use-case in which speaker-related information is used jointly with automatic speech recognition engines to generate speaker-attributed transcriptions. To achieve that, we employ a user-friendly web-based interface to process audio and video inputs with the chosen configuration.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Contrastive Learning and Self-Training for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Limited Labeled Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multimodal Emotion Recognition challenge MER2024 focuses on recognizing emotions using audio, language, and visual signals. In this paper, we present our submission solutions for the Semi-Supervised Learning Sub-Challenge (MER2024-SEMI), which tackles the issue of limited annotated data in emotion recognition. Firstly, to address the class imbalance, we adopt an oversampling strategy. Secondly, we propose a modality representation combinatorial contrastive learning (MR-CCL) framework on the trimodal input data to establish robust initial models. Thirdly, we explore a self-training approach to expand the training set. Finally, we enhance prediction robustness through a multi-classifier weighted soft voting strategy. Our proposed method is validated to be effective on the MER2024-SEMI Challenge, achieving a weighted average F-score of 88.25% and ranking 6th on the leaderboard. Our project is available at https://github.com/WooyoohL/MER2024-SEMI.</description>

      <title>Mel-RoFormer for Vocal Separation and Vocal Melody Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a versatile deep neural network to model music audio is crucial in MIR. This task is challenging due to the intricate spectral variations inherent in music signals, which convey melody, harmonics, and timbres of diverse instruments. In this paper, we introduce Mel-RoFormer, a spectrogram-based model featuring two key designs: a novel Mel-band Projection module at the front-end to enhance the model's capability to capture informative features across multiple frequency bands, and interleaved RoPE Transformers to explicitly model the frequency and time dimensions as two separate sequences. We apply Mel-RoFormer to tackle two essential MIR tasks: vocal separation and vocal melody transcription, aimed at isolating singing voices from audio mixtures and transcribing their lead melodies, respectively. Despite their shared focus on singing signals, these tasks possess distinct optimization objectives. Instead of training a unified model, we adopt a two-step approach. Initially, we train a vocal separation model, which subsequently serves as a foundation model for fine-tuning for vocal melody transcription. Through extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, we showcase that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in both vocal separation and melody transcription tasks, underscoring the efficacy and versatility of Mel-RoFormer in modeling complex music audio signals.</description>

      <title>PB-LRDWWS System for the SLT 2024 Low-Resource Dysarthria Wake-Up Word Spotting Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the SLT 2024 Low-Resource Dysarthria Wake-Up Word Spotting (LRDWWS) Challenge, we introduce the PB-LRDWWS system. This system combines a dysarthric speech content feature extractor for prototype construction with a prototype-based classification method. The feature extractor is a fine-tuned HuBERT model obtained through a three-stage fine-tuning process using cross-entropy loss. This fine-tuned HuBERT extracts features from the target dysarthric speaker's enrollment speech to build prototypes. Classification is achieved by calculating the cosine similarity between the HuBERT features of the target dysarthric speaker's evaluation speech and prototypes. Despite its simplicity, our method demonstrates effectiveness through experimental results. Our system achieves second place in the final Test-B of the LRDWWS Challenge.</description>

      <title>Flow-TSVAD: Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection via Latent Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization is typically considered a discriminative task, using discriminative approaches to produce fixed diarization results. In this paper, we explore the use of neural network-based generative methods for speaker diarization for the first time. We implement a Flow-Matching (FM) based generative algorithm within the sequence-to-sequence target speaker voice activity detection (Seq2Seq-TSVAD) diarization system. Our experiments reveal that applying the generative method directly to the original binary label sequence space of the TS-VAD output is ineffective. To address this issue, we propose mapping the binary label sequence into a dense latent space before applying the generative algorithm and our proposed Flow-TSVAD method outperforms the Seq2Seq-TSVAD system. Additionally, we observe that the FM algorithm converges rapidly during the inference stage, requiring only two inference steps to achieve promising results. As a generative model, Flow-TSVAD allows for sampling different diarization results by running the model multiple times. Moreover, ensembling results from various sampling instances further enhances diarization performance.</description>

      <title>Just ASR + LLM? A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. Remarkably, SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialogue question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation context alone without identifying the speaker asked in the question. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM in both Gaokao and our proposed "What Do You Like?" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered correctly with correct speaker identification. Our results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that our definitions and automated classification of context-based and identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA tasks.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Efficient Breath Sound Removal in Studio Audio Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we present an innovative, parameter-efficient model that utilizes the attention U-Net architecture for the automatic detection and eradication of non-speech vocal sounds, specifically breath sounds, in vocal recordings. This task is of paramount importance in the field of sound engineering, despite being relatively under-explored. The conventional manual process for detecting and eliminating these sounds requires significant expertise and is extremely time-intensive. Existing automated detection and removal methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and precision. Our proposed model addresses these limitations by offering a streamlined process and superior accuracy, achieved through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. A unique dataset, derived from Device and Produced Speech (DAPS), was employed for this purpose. The training phase of the model emphasizes a log spectrogram and integrates an early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting. Our model not only conserves precious time for sound engineers but also enhances the quality and consistency of audio production. This constitutes a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by its comparative efficiency, necessitating only 1.9M parameters and a training duration of 3.2 hours - markedly less than the top-performing models in this domain. The model is capable of generating identical outputs as previous models with drastically improved precision, making it an optimal choice.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Prosody and Semantic Information with Pre-trained Model for In-Context Learning based Zero-Shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) aims to modify the speaker's timbre while retaining speech content. Previous approaches have tokenized the outputs from self-supervised into semantic tokens, facilitating disentanglement of speech content information. Recently, in-context learning (ICL) has emerged in text-to-speech (TTS) systems for effectively modeling specific characteristics such as timbre through context conditioning. This paper proposes an ICL capability enhanced VC system (ICL-VC) employing a mask and reconstruction training strategy based on flow-matching generative models. Augmented with semantic tokens, our experiments on the LibriTTS dataset demonstrate that ICL-VC improves speaker similarity. Additionally, we find that k-means is a versatile tokenization method applicable to various pre-trained models. However, the ICL-VC system faces challenges in preserving the prosody of the source speech. To mitigate this issue, we propose incorporating prosody embeddings extracted from a pre-trained emotion recognition model into our system. Integration of prosody embeddings notably enhances the system's capability to preserve source speech prosody, as validated on the Emotional Speech Database.</description>

      <title>Audio-Guided Fusion Techniques for Multimodal Emotion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a solution for the semi-supervised learning track (MER-SEMI) in MER2024. First, in order to enhance the performance of the feature extractor on sentiment classification tasks,we fine-tuned video and text feature extractors, specifically CLIP-vit-large and Baichuan-13B, using labeled data. This approach effectively preserves the original emotional information conveyed in the videos. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided Transformer (AGT) fusion mechanism, which leverages the robustness of Hubert-large, showing superior effectiveness in fusing both inter-channel and intra-channel information. Third, To enhance the accuracy of the model, we iteratively apply self-supervised learning by using high-confidence unlabeled data as pseudo-labels. Finally, through black-box probing, we discovered an imbalanced data distribution between the training and test sets. Therefore, We adopt a prior-knowledge-based voting mechanism. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, ultimately earning us third place in the MER-SEMI track.</description>

      <title>Improving Multimodal Emotion Recognition by Leveraging Acoustic Adaptation and Visual Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to automatically identify and understand human emotional states by integrating information from various modalities. However, the scarcity of annotated multimodal data significantly hinders the advancement of this research field. This paper presents our solution for the MER-SEMI sub-challenge of MER 2024. First, to better adapt acoustic modality features for the MER task, we experimentally evaluate the contributions of different layers of the pre-trained speech model HuBERT in emotion recognition. Based on these observations, we perform Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on the layers identified as most effective for emotion recognition tasks, thereby achieving optimal adaptation for emotion recognition with a minimal number of learnable parameters. Second, leveraging the strengths of the acoustic modality, we propose a feature alignment pre-training method. This approach uses large-scale unlabeled data to train a visual encoder, thereby promoting the semantic alignment of visual features within the acoustic feature space. Finally, using the adapted acoustic features, aligned visual features, and lexical features, we employ an attention mechanism for feature fusion. On the MER2024-SEMI test set, the proposed method achieves a weighted F1 score of 88.90%, ranking fourth among all participating teams, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Generic Representations for Domain-Generalized Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a reliable anomalous sound detection (ASD) system requires robustness to noise, adaptation to domain shifts, and effective performance with limited training data. Current leading methods rely on extensive labeled data for each target machine type to train feature extractors using Outlier-Exposure (OE) techniques, yet their performance on the target domain remains sub-optimal. In this paper, we present \textit{GenRep}, which utilizes generic feature representations from a robust, large-scale pre-trained feature extractor combined with kNN for domain-generalized ASD, without the need for fine-tuning. \textit{GenRep} incorporates MemMixup, a simple approach for augmenting the target memory bank using nearest source samples, paired with a domain normalization technique to address the imbalance between source and target domains. \textit{GenRep} outperforms the best OE-based approach without a need for labeled data with an Official Score of 73.79\% on the DCASE2023T2 Eval set and demonstrates robustness under limited data scenarios. The code is available open-source.</description>

      <title>The first Cadenza challenges: using machine learning competitions to improve music for listeners with a hearing loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that listening to music is an issue for those with hearing loss, and hearing aids are not a universal solution. How can machine learning be used to address this? This paper details the first application of the open challenge methodology to use machine learning to improve audio quality of music for those with hearing loss. The first challenge was a stand-alone competition (CAD1) and had 9 entrants. The second was an 2024 ICASSP grand challenge (ICASSP24) and attracted 17 entrants. The challenge tasks concerned demixing and remixing pop/rock music to allow a personalised rebalancing of the instruments in the mix, along with amplification to correct for raised hearing thresholds. The software baselines provided for entrants to build upon used two state-of-the-art demix algorithms: Hybrid Demucs and Open-Unmix. Evaluation of systems was done using the objective metric HAAQI, the Hearing-Aid Audio Quality Index. No entrants improved on the best baseline in CAD1 because there was insufficient room for improvement. Consequently, for ICASSP24 the scenario was made more difficult by using loudspeaker reproduction and specified gains to be applied before remixing. This also made the scenario more useful for listening through hearing aids. 9 entrants scored better than the the best ICASSP24 baseline. Most entrants used a refined version of Hybrid Demucs and NAL-R amplification. The highest scoring system combined the outputs of several demixing algorithms in an ensemble approach. These challenges are now open benchmarks for future research with the software and data being freely available.</description>

      <title>Better Spanish Emotion Recognition In-the-wild: Bringing Attention to Deep Spectrum Voice Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of creating new Socially Assistive Robots, emotion recognition has become a key development factor, as it allows the robot to adapt to the user's emotional state in the wild. In this work, we focused on the analysis of two voice recording Spanish datasets: ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Specifically, we centered our work in the paralanguage, e.~g. the vocal characteristics that go along with the message and clarifies the meaning. We proposed the use of the DeepSpectrum method, which consists of extracting a visual representation of the audio tracks and feeding them to a pretrained CNN model. For the classification task, DeepSpectrum is often paired with a Support Vector Classifier --DS-SVC--, or a Fully-Connected deep-learning classifier --DS-FC--. We compared the results of the DS-SVC and DS-FC architectures with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Moreover, we proposed our own classifier based upon Attention Mechanisms, namely DS-AM. We trained all models against both datasets, and we found that our DS-AM model outperforms the SOTA models for the datasets and the SOTA DeepSpectrum architectures. Finally, we trained our DS-AM model in one dataset and tested it in the other, to simulate real-world conditions on how biased is the model to the dataset.</description>

      <title>Transferable Selective Virtual Sensing Active Noise Control Technique Based on Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual sensing (VS) technology enables active noise control (ANC) systems to attenuate noise at virtual locations distant from the physical error microphones. Appropriate auxiliary filters (AF) can significantly enhance the effectiveness of VS approaches. The selection of appropriate AF for various types of noise can be automatically achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, training the CNN model for different ANC systems is often labour-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, Transferable Selective VS, by integrating metric-learning technology into CNN-based VS approaches. The Transferable Selective VS method allows a pre-trained CNN to be applied directly to new ANC systems without requiring retraining, and it can handle unseen noise types. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in attenuating sudden-varying broadband noises and real-world noises.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Speaker Diarization: Current Databases, Approaches and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the large amount of audio-visual content available has fostered the need to develop new robust automatic speaker diarization systems to analyse and characterise it. This kind of system helps to reduce the cost of doing this process manually and allows the use of the speaker information for different applications, as a huge quantity of information is present, for example, images of faces, or audio recordings. Therefore, this paper aims to address a critical area in the field of speaker diarization systems, the integration of audio-visual content of different domains. This paper seeks to push beyond current state-of-the-art practices by developing a robust audio-visual speaker diarization framework adaptable to various data domains, including TV scenarios, meetings, and daily activities. Unlike most of the existing audio-visual speaker diarization systems, this framework will also include the proposal of an approach to lead the precise assignment of specific identities in TV scenarios where celebrities appear. In addition, in this work, we have conducted an extensive compilation of the current state-of-the-art approaches and the existing databases for developing audio-visual speaker diarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural audio codec (NAC) unlock new potential in audio signal processing. Studies have increasingly explored leveraging the latent features of NAC for various speech signal processing tasks. This paper introduces the first approach to speech bandwidth extension (BWE) that utilizes the discrete features obtained from NAC. By restoring high-frequency details within highly compressed discrete tokens, this approach enhances speech intelligibility and naturalness. Based on Vector Quantized Diffusion, the proposed framework combines the strengths of advanced NAC, diffusion models, and Mamba-2 to reconstruct high-frequency speech components. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method exhibits superior performance across both log-spectral distance and ViSQOL, significantly improving speech quality.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Inversion Through Self-Supervised Embeddings and Enhanced Tract Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models depends significantly on their capacity to encode input features efficiently and decode them into meaningful outputs. Better input and output representation has the potential to boost models' performance and generalization. In the context of acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion (SI) systems, we study the impact of utilizing speech representations acquired via self-supervised learning (SSL) models, such as HuBERT compared to conventional acoustic features. Additionally, we investigate the incorporation of novel tract variables (TVs) through an improved geometric transformation model. By combining these two approaches, we improve the Pearson product-moment correlation (PPMC) scores which evaluate the accuracy of TV estimation of the SI system from 0.7452 to 0.8141, a 6.9% increase. Our findings underscore the profound influence of rich feature representations from SSL models and improved geometric transformations with target TVs on the enhanced functionality of SI systems.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Speaker Verification: Joint Modeling with DFSMN and Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker verification is to judge the similarity between two unknown voices in an open set, where the ideal speaker embedding should be able to condense discriminant information into a compact utterance-level representation that has small intra-speaker distances and large inter-speaker distances. We propose Voice Transformer (VOT), a novel model for speaker verification, which integrates parallel transformers at multiple scales. A deep feedforward sequential memory network (DFSMN) is incorporated into the attention part of these transformers to increase feature granularity. The attentive statistics pooling layer is added to focus on important frames and form utterance-level features. We propose Additive Angular Margin Focal Loss (AAMF) to address the hard samples problem. We evaluate the proposed approach on the VoxCeleb1 and CN-Celeb2 datasets, demonstrating that VOT surpasses most mainstream models. The code is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/luckyerr/Voice-Transformer_Speaker-Verification}}.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Autoregressive Methods for Audio Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents an evaluation of popular audio inpainting methods based on autoregressive modeling, namely the extrapolation-based and Janssen methods. A novel variant of the Janssen method suitable for inpainting of gaps is also proposed. The main differences between the particular popular approaches are pointed out. In the experimental part, the importance of the choice of the AR model estimator is confirmed by objective metrics. Then, a mid-scale computational experiment is presented, and its results are confirmed by a listening test. All the experiments demonstrate the superiority of the new gap-wise Janssen method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time and Accurate: Zero-shot High-Fidelity Singing Voice Conversion with Multi-Condition Flow Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion is to convert the source singing voice into the target singing voice except for the content. Currently, flow-based models can complete the task of voice conversion, but they struggle to effectively extract latent variables in the more rhythmically rich and emotionally expressive task of singing voice conversion, while also facing issues with low efficiency in speech processing. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity flow-based model based on multi-decoupling feature constraints called RASVC, which enhances the capture of vocal details by integrating multiple latent attribute encoders. We also use Multi-stream inverse short-time Fourier transform(MS-iSTFT) to enhance the speed of speech processing by skipping some complicated decoder processing steps. We compare the synthesized singing voice with other models from multiple dimensions, and our proposed model is highly consistent with the current state-of-the-art, with the demo which is available at \url{https://lazycat1119.github.io/RASVC-demo/}.</description>

      <title>Breaking Walls: Pioneering Automatic Speech Recognition for Central Kurdish: End-to-End Transformer Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end transformer-based models epitomize the cutting-edge in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Despite their substantial benefits, these models demand extensive training data to perform optimally, presenting a significant challenge for low-resource languages such as Central Kurdish. Addressing this issue requires innovative methods and techniques. This paper aims to develop an ASR system for Intermediate Kurdish by collecting a robust corpus of speech, using the N-GRAM language model, and utilizing an external Kurdish tokenizer for refinement and integration techniques to enhance the model's performance. We collect a comprehensive 100-hour speech corpus from diverse sources. Additionally, applied fine-tuning techniques to our speech corpus on Persian, English, and Arabic pre-trained models, specifically utilizing the xls-r-300m, xls-r-1b, and xls-r-2b Wav2vec 2.0 models. And utilized language models trained by 3-gram and 4-gram from a large text corpus of 300 million tokens. The fine-tuned xls-r-2b model, combined with a 3-gram language model and included external Kurdish tokenizer, achieved the best performance, yielding a Word Error Rate (WER) of 10.0% on the validation set and 11.8% on the Asosoft test set. The ASR model has demonstrated the advantages of having a large vocabulary compared to the existing Kurdish ASR models. Compared to other models, it produced more accurate and higher performance outcomes by working with a lower error rate.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Training Dataset Size on Discriminative and Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of deep neural network-based speech enhancement systems typically increases with the training dataset size. However, studies that investigated the effect of training dataset size on speech enhancement performance did not consider recent approaches, such as diffusion-based generative models. Diffusion models are typically trained with massive datasets for image generation tasks, but whether this is also required for speech enhancement is unknown. Moreover, studies that investigated the effect of training dataset size did not control for the data diversity. It is thus unclear whether the performance improvement was due to the increased dataset size or diversity. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effect of training dataset size on the performance of popular state-of-the-art discriminative and diffusion-based speech enhancement systems in matched conditions. We control for the data diversity by using a fixed set of speech utterances, noise segments and binaural room impulse responses to generate datasets of different sizes. We find that the diffusion-based systems perform the best relative to the discriminative systems in terms of objective metrics with datasets of 10 h or less. However, their objective metrics performance does not improve when increasing the training dataset size as much as the discriminative systems, and they are outperformed by the discriminative systems with datasets of 100 h or more.</description>

      <title>Emilia: An Extensive, Multilingual, and Diverse Speech Dataset for Large-Scale Speech Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech generation models have been significantly driven by the use of large-scale training data. However, producing highly spontaneous, human-like speech remains a challenge due to the scarcity of large, diverse, and spontaneous speech datasets. In response, we introduce Emilia, the first large-scale, multilingual, and diverse speech generation dataset. Emilia starts with over 101k hours of speech across six languages, covering a wide range of speaking styles to enable more natural and spontaneous speech generation. To facilitate the scale-up of Emilia, we also present Emilia-Pipe, the first open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to efficiently transform raw, in-the-wild speech data into high-quality training data with speech annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both Emilia and Emilia-Pipe. Demos are available at: https://emilia-dataset.github.io/Emilia-Demo-Page/.</description>

      <title>YOLO-Stutter: End-to-end Region-Wise Speech Dysfluency Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dysfluent speech detection is the bottleneck for disordered speech analysis and spoken language learning. Current state-of-the-art models are governed by rule-based systems which lack efficiency and robustness, and are sensitive to template design. In this paper, we propose YOLO-Stutter: a first end-to-end method that detects dysfluencies in a time-accurate manner. YOLO-Stutter takes imperfect speech-text alignment as input, followed by a spatial feature aggregator, and a temporal dependency extractor to perform region-wise boundary and class predictions. We also introduce two dysfluency corpus, VCTK-Stutter and VCTK-TTS, that simulate natural spoken dysfluencies including repetition, block, missing, replacement, and prolongation. Our end-to-end method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a minimum number of trainable parameters for on both simulated data and real aphasia speech.

      <title>User-Driven Voice Generation and Editing through Latent Space Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a user-driven approach for synthesizing highly specific target voices based on user feedback, which is particularly beneficial for speech-impaired individuals who wish to recreate their lost voices but lack prior recordings. Specifically, we leverage the neural analysis and synthesis framework to construct a low-dimensional, yet sufficiently expressive latent speaker embedding space. Within this latent space, we implement a search algorithm that guides users to their desired voice through completing a sequence of straightforward comparison tasks. Both synthetic simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively approximate target voices. Moreover, by analyzing the mel-spectrogram generator's Jacobians, we identify a set of meaningful voice editing directions within the latent space. These directions enable users to further fine-tune specific attributes of the generated voice, including the pitch level, pitch range, volume, vocal tension, nasality, and tone color.

      <title>Low-Complexity Own Voice Reconstruction for Hearables with an In-Ear Microphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hearable devices, equipped with one or more microphones, are commonly used for speech communication. Here, we consider the scenario where a hearable is used to capture the user's own voice in a noisy environment. In this scenario, own voice reconstruction (OVR) is essential for enhancing the quality and intelligibility of the recorded noisy own voice signals. In previous work, we developed a deep learning-based OVR system, aiming to reduce the amount of device-specific recordings for training by using data augmentation with phoneme-dependent models of own voice transfer characteristics. Given the limited computational resources available on hearables, in this paper we propose low-complexity variants of an OVR system based on the FT-JNF architecture and investigate the required amount of device-specific recordings for effective data augmentation and fine-tuning. Simulation results show that the proposed OVR system considerably improves speech quality, even under constraints of low complexity and a limited amount of device-specific recordings.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Speech Enhancement Using Burst Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the MBURST, a novel multimodal solution for audio-visual speech enhancements that consider the most recent neurological discoveries regarding pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions. The so-called burst propagation implements several criteria to address the credit assignment problem in a more biologically plausible manner: steering the sign and magnitude of plasticity through feedback, multiplexing the feedback and feedforward information across layers through different weight connections, approximating feedback and feedforward connections, and linearizing the feedback signals. MBURST benefits from such capabilities to learn correlations between the noisy signal and the visual stimuli, thus attributing meaning to the speech by amplifying relevant information and suppressing noise. Experiments conducted over a Grid Corpus and CHiME3-based dataset show that MBURST can reproduce similar mask reconstructions to the multimodal backpropagation-based baseline while demonstrating outstanding energy efficiency management, reducing the neuron firing rates to values up to \textbf{$70\%$} lower. Such a feature implies more sustainable implementations, suitable and desirable for hearing aids or any other similar embedded systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the AI community has made significant strides in developing powerful foundation models, driven by large-scale multimodal datasets. However, for audio representation learning, existing datasets suffer from limitations in the following aspects: insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To establish an audio dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an innovative, automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as video frames, audio streams. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.5M audio-text pairs. We exploit a series of pre-trained models or APIs, to determine audio-visual synchronisation, generate image captions, object detection, or audio tags for specific videos. Subsequently, we employ LLM to paraphrase a congruent caption for each audio, guided by the extracted multi-modality clues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train widely used models on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks, for example, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, zero-shot classification. In addition, we establish a novel benchmark with environmental information and provide a benchmark for audio-text tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning of Spatial Acoustic Representation with Cross-Channel Signal Reconstruction and Multi-Channel Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning methods have shown effectiveness in estimating spatial acoustic parameters such as time difference of arrival, direct-to-reverberant ratio and reverberation time. However, they still suffer from the simulation-to-reality generalization problem due to the mismatch between simulated and real-world acoustic characteristics and the deficiency of annotated real-world data. To this end, this work proposes a self-supervised method that takes full advantage of unlabeled data for spatial acoustic parameter estimation. First, a new pretext task, i.e. cross-channel signal reconstruction (CCSR), is designed to learn a universal spatial acoustic representation from unlabeled multi-channel microphone signals. We mask partial signals of one channel and ask the model to reconstruct them, which makes it possible to learn spatial acoustic information from unmasked signals and extract source information from the other microphone channel. An encoder-decoder structure is used to disentangle the two kinds of information. By fine-tuning the pre-trained spatial encoder with a small annotated dataset, this encoder can be used to estimate spatial acoustic parameters. Second, a novel multi-channel audio Conformer (MC-Conformer) is adopted as the encoder model architecture, which is suitable for both the pretext and downstream tasks. It is carefully designed to be able to capture the local and global characteristics of spatial acoustics exhibited in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results of five acoustic parameter estimation tasks on both simulated and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised learning method in the field of spatial acoustic representation learning and multi-channel audio signal processing.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>ProGRes: Prompted Generative Rescoring on ASR n-Best</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to improve the performance of speech recognizers by effectively rescoring the n-best hypotheses generated during the beam search process. However, the best way to exploit recent generative instruction-tuned LLMs for hypothesis rescoring is still unclear. This paper proposes a novel method that uses instruction-tuned LLMs to dynamically expand the n-best speech recognition hypotheses with new hypotheses generated through appropriately-prompted LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a new zero-shot method for ASR n-best rescoring, which combines confidence scores, LLM sequence scoring, and prompt-based hypothesis generation. We compare Llama-3-Instruct, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 Turbo as prompt-based generators with Llama-3 as sequence scorer LLM. We evaluated our approach using different speech recognizers and observed significant relative improvement in the word error rate (WER) ranging from 5% to 25%.</description>

      <title>Estimating Indoor Scene Depth Maps from Ultrasonic Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03336</link>

Abstract: Measuring 3D geometric structures of indoor scenes requires dedicated depth sensors, which are not always available. Echo-based depth estimation has recently been studied as a promising alternative solution. All previous studies have assumed the use of echoes in the audible range. However, one major problem is that audible echoes cannot be used in quiet spaces or other situations where producing audible sounds is prohibited. In this paper, we consider echo-based depth estimation using inaudible ultrasonic echoes. While ultrasonic waves provide high measurement accuracy in theory, the actual depth estimation accuracy when ultrasonic echoes are used has remained unclear, due to its disadvantage of being sensitive to noise and susceptible to attenuation. We first investigate the depth estimation accuracy when the frequency of the sound source is restricted to the high-frequency band, and found that the accuracy decreased when the frequency was limited to ultrasonic ranges. Based on this observation, we propose a novel deep learning method to improve the accuracy of ultrasonic echo-based depth estimation by using audible echoes as auxiliary data only during training. Experimental results with a public dataset demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-time Speech Enhancement on Raw Signals with Deep State-space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present aTENNuate, a simple deep state-space autoencoder configured for efficient online raw speech enhancement in an end-to-end fashion. The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.
