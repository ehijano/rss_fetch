      <title>On the geometry of WDVV equations and their Hamiltonian formalism in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that in low dimensions WDVV equations can be rewritten as
  commuting quasilinear bi-Hamiltonian systems. We extend some of these
  results to arbitrary dimension $N$ and arbitrary scalar product $\eta$. In
  particular, we show that WDVV equations can be interpreted as a set of linear
  line congruences in suitable Pl\"ucker embeddings. This form leads to their
  representation as Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. Moreover, we
  show that in low dimensions and for an arbitrary $\eta$ WDVV equations can be
  reduced to passive orthonomic form. This leads to the commutativity of the
  Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. We conjecture that such a result
  holds in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalised spin Calogero-Moser systems from Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin Calogero-Moser type systems with non-symmetric configurations of the singularities of the potential appeared in the work of Chalykh, Goncharenko, and Veselov in 1999. We obtain various generalisations of these examples by making use of the representation theory of Cherednik algebras.</description>

      <title>Stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials, and discrete Painlev\'{e}-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlev\'{e}-type (d-P-type) equations. We apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations or integrable difference systems with potential relations with new d-P-type equations, along with their particular solutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the derived integrable difference system related to the Cauchy biorthogonality is a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the integrable difference system related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and it is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <title>Landau levels of a Dirac electron in graphene from non-uniform magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>
