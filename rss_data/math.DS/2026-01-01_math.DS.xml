      <title>Transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any $C^{1+\alpha}$ transitive conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a closed 3-manifold with virtually solvable fundamental group is ergodic. Consequently, in light of \cite{FP-classify}, this establishes the equivalence between transitivity and ergodicity for $C^{1+\alpha}$ conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in \emph{any} closed 3-manifold. Moreover, we provide a characterization of compact accessibility classes under transitivity, thereby giving a precise classification of all accessibility classes for transitive 3-dimensional partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Variation of Physical Measures in Nontrivial Mixed Partially Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a smooth nontrivial mixed partially hyperbolic system and explicitly identify its skeleton. This example shares characteristics with the classical examples. Moreover, the support of each physical measure contains three fixed points with mutually distinct unstable indices. By appropriately perturbing the skeleton, we provide an example where the number of physical measures varies upper semi-continuously. The general framework of mixed partially hyperbolic systems has been studied in theorem.</description>

      <title>Intermediate topological entropies for subsets of nonautonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of intermediate dimensions introduced by Falconer et al., we introduce a continuum of topological entropies that are intermediate between the (Bowen) topological entropy and the lower and upper capacity topological entropies. This is achieved by restricting the families of allowable covers in the definition of topological entropy by requiring that the lengths of all strings used in a particular cover satisfy \( N \le n &lt; N/\theta + 1 \), where \( \theta \in [0,1] \) is a parameter. When \( \theta = 1 \), only covers using strings of the same length are allowed, and we recover the lower and upper capacity topological entropies; when \( \theta = 0 \), there are no restrictions, and the definition coincides with the topological entropy. We first establish a quantitative inequality for the upper and lower intermediate topological entropies, which mirrors the corresponding result for intermediate dimensions. As a consequence, the intermediate topological entropies are continuous on $(0,1]$, though discontinuity may arise at $0$; an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate this phenomenon. We then investigate several fundamental properties of the intermediate topological entropies for nonautonomous dynamical systems, including the power rule, monotonicity and product formulas. Finally, we derive an inequality relating intermediate entropies with respect to factor maps.</description>

      <title>The Radon--Nikodym topography of acyclic measured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study locally countable acyclic measure-class-preserving (mcp) Borel graphs by analyzing their "topography" -- the interaction between the geometry and the associated Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.
  At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended.
  Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon--Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.</description>

      <title>Phase Reduction of Limit Cycle Oscillators: A Tutorial Review with New Perspectives on Isochrons and an Outlook to Higher-Order Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase reduction technique is essential for studying rhythmic phenomena across various scientific fields. It allows the complex dynamics of high-dimensional oscillatory systems to be expressed by a single phase variable. This paper provides a detailed review and synthesis of phase reduction with two main goals. First, we develop a solid geometric framework for the theory by creating isochrons, which are the level sets of the asymptotic phase, using the Graph Transform theorem. We show that isochrons form an invariant, continuous structure of the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle, helping to clarify the concept of the asymptotic phase. Second, we systematically explain how to derive the first-order phase reduction for weakly perturbed and coupled systems. In the end, we discuss the limitations of the first-order approach, particularly its restriction to very small perturbations and the issue of vanishing coupling terms in certain networks. We finish by outlining the framework and importance of higher-order phase reductions. This establishes a clear link from classical theory to modern developments and sets the stage for a more in-depth discussion in a future publication.</description>

      <title>Four collapsing one-dimensional particles: a dynamical system approach of the spherical billiard reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of four one-dimensional inelastic hard spheres evolving on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and colliding according to a scattering law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient $r$. We study the possible orders of collisions when the inelastic collapse occurs, relying on the so-called $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping, a two-dimensional dynamical system associated to the original particle system which encodes all the possible collision orders. We prove that the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping is a piecewise projective transformation, which allows one to perform efficient numerical simulations of its orbits. We recover previously known results concerning the one-dimensional four-particle inelastic hard sphere system and we support the conjectures stated in the literature concerning particular periodic orbits. We discover three new families of periodic orbits that coexist depending on the restitution coefficient, we prove rigorously that there exist stable periodic orbits for the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping for restitution coefficients larger than the upper bounds previously known, and we prove the existence of quasi-periodic orbits for this mapping.</description>

      <title>Anomalous cw-expansive homeomorphisms on compact surfaces of higher genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct cw-expansive homeomorphisms on compact surfaces of genus greater than or equal to zero with a fixed point whose local stable set is connected but not locally connected. This provides an affirmative answer to question posed by Artigue [3]. To achieve this, we generalize the construction from the example of Artigue, Pacifico and Vieitez [6], obtaining examples of homeomorphisms on compact surfaces of genus greater than or equal to two that are 2-expansive but not expansive. On the sphere and the torus, we construct new examples of cw2-expansive homeomorphisms that are not N -expansive for all N greater than or equal to one.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectral Analysis Through Pseudo-Resolvent Koopman Operator in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for spectral analysis of the Koopman operator based on direct construction of the pseudo-resolvent from time-series data. Finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator, such as those obtained from Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, are known to suffer from spectral pollution. To address this issue, we construct the pseudo-resolvent operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity whose norm serves as a spectral indicator, and pseudoeigenfunctions are extracted as directions of maximal amplification. We establish convergence of the approximate spectrum to the true spectrum in the Hausdorff metric for isolated eigenvalues, with preservation of algebraic multiplicities, and derive error bounds for eigenvalue approximation. Numerical experiments on pendulum, Lorenz, and coupled oscillator systems demonstrate that the method effectively suppresses spectral pollution and resolves closely spaced spectral components.</description>

      <title>The Flow-Limit of Reflect-Reflect-Relax: Existence, Stability, and Discrete-Time Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Reflect-Reflect-Relax (RRR) algorithm in its small-step (flow-limit) regime. In the smooth transversal setting, we show that the transverse dynamics form a hyperbolic sink, yielding exponential decay of a natural gap measure. Under uniform geometric assumptions, we construct a tubular neighborhood of the feasible manifold on which the squared gap defines a strict Lyapunov function, excluding recurrent dynamics and chaotic behavior within this basin.
  In the discrete setting, the induced flow is piecewise constant on W-domains and supports Filippov sliding along convergent boundaries, leading to finite-time capture into a solution domain. We prove that small-step RRR is a forward-Euler discretization of this flow, so that solution times measured in rescaled units converge to a finite limit while iteration counts diverge, explaining the emergence of iteration-optimal relaxation parameters. Finally, we introduce a heuristic mesoscopic framework based on percolation and renormalization group to organize performance deterioration near the Douglas-Rachford limit.</description>

      <title>Safe Sliding Mode Control for Marine Vessels Using High-Order Control Barrier Functions and Fast Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many cellular automata, it is possible to express the state of a given cell after $n$ iterations as an explicit function of the initial configuration. We say that for such rules the solution of the initial value problem can be obtained. In some cases, one can construct the solution formula for the initial value problem by analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern generated by the rule and decomposing it into simpler segments which one can then describe algebraically. We show an example of a rule when such approach is successful, namely elementary rule 156. Solution of the initial value problem for this rule is constructed and then used to compute the density of ones after $n$ iterations, starting from a random initial condition. We also show how to obtain probabilities of occurrence of longer blocks of symbols.</description>

      <title>Multipliers for forced Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee the stability of Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities, but give no guarantee that the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish periodic quasiconformal extension theorems for periodic orientation-preserving quasisymmetric self homeomorphisms of quasicircles or quasi-round carpets. As applications, we prove that, if $f$ is a periodic orientation-preserving quasisymmetric self homeomorphism of a quasi-round carpet $S$ of measure zero in $\mathbb{C}$, which has a fixed point in the outer peripheral circle of $S$, then $f$ is the identity on $S$. Moreover, we prove that, if $f$ is a quasisymmetric self homeomorphism of a square carpet $S$ of measure zero in a rectangle ring, which fixes each of the four vertices of the outer peripheral circle of $S$, then $f$ is the identity on $S$. An analogous rigidity problem for the $\mathbb{C}^*$-square carpets is discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish maximal inequalities and deduce ergodic theorems for state-preserving actions of amenable, locally compact, second-countable groups on tracial non-commutative $L^1$-spaces.

      <title>Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.</description>

Abstract: We prove a priori bounds for Feigenbaum quadratic polynomials, i.e., infinitely renormalizable polynomials $f_c: z\mapsto z^2+c$ of bounded type. It implies local connectivity of the corresponding Julia sets $J(f_c)$ and MLC (local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set) at the corresponding parameters $c$. It also yields the scaling Universality, dynamical and parameter, for the corresponding combinatorics. The MLC Conjecture was open for the most classical period-doubling Feigenbaum parameter as well as for the complex tripling renormalizations. Universality for the latter was conjectured by Goldberg-Khanin-Sinai in the early 1980s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a sequence $S=\{(X,f_n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of dynamical systems sharing a common ambient space, the point $f^k_n(x)$ visited by a certain $x\in X$ depends on the iteration order $k$ and on the index $n$ specifying the system in $S$. If the sequence of maps $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is eventually constant at every point, the $f_n$-orbits show an emergent poset structure. A maximal initial segment of this poset is isomorphic to a certain countable ordinal $\ge\omega$. We study this transfinite emergent structure from the point of view of topological dynamics, investigating orbits, recurrence, limit sets, attractors and conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on stochastic converse Lyapunov theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.</description>

Abstract: We study bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on nearest neighbor graphs, which may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, when it may have phase-lag. We use the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable or unstable two-parameter family of modulated twisted solutions that oscillate or not depending on whether the phase-lag exists or not is born. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM on deterministic dense, random dense and random sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Linear Fractional Impulsive Evolution Equations in Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. The system under consideration involves the Caputo fractional derivative of order $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, a closed linear operator generating a strongly continuous semigroup, and instantaneous state jumps governed by bounded linear impulse operators. We first derive an explicit representation of the mild solution by combining fractional solution operators with impulsive operators. Using this representation, we characterize the approximate controllability of the system through a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of the convergence of an associated family of impulsive resolvent operators. This resolvent condition extends the classical criterion for approximate controllability to the fractional impulsive setting. To illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results, a concrete example is provided. The analysis presented here bridges the gap between the well-established theory for integer-order impulsive systems and the more complex fractional case, highlighting the distinct challenges and solutions arising from the interplay of fractional dynamics and impulsive effects.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose a framework to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted/noisy observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approaches through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on model discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an old idea to use gradient flows or time-discretized variants thereof as methods for solving minimization problems. In some applications, for example in machine learning contexts, it is important to know that for generic initial data, gradient flow trajectories do not get stuck at saddle points. There are classical results concerned with the non-degenerate situation. But if the Hessian of the objective function has a non-trivial kernel at the critical point, then these results are inconclusive in general. In this paper, we show how relevant information can be extracted by ``blowing up'' the objective function around the non-strict saddle point, i.e., by a suitable non-linear rescaling that makes the higher order geometry visible.</description>
