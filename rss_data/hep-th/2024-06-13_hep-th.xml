      <title>Revisiting the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric trinification models from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric trinification models with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(3)_C\times \mathrm{U}(3)_L \times \mathrm{U}(3)_R$ in Type IIA string theory on $\mathbf{T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)}$ orientifold with intersecting D6-branes. The non-trivial K-theory conditions and tadpole cancellation conditions severely restrict the number of allowed models even for the case of rectangular two-tori. Using a supervised search algorithm, we find a few four-family models where the highest wrapping number is 2. For these models, we present the complete particle spectra and the gauge coupling relations at the string-scale.</description>

      <title>Soft zero for cylindrical gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graviton S-matrix has a famous soft pole. We show that the S-matrix for cylindrical gravitational waves has a soft zero. The soft pole for ordinary gravitons comes from a Ward identity for supertranslation symmetry at asymptotic infinity. We show that the soft zero for cylindrical gravitational waves comes from a Ward identity for Geroch symmetry at asymptotic infinity. Because it is a zero rather than a pole, there is no memory effect. Overall, this soft zero is a manifestation of Geroch symmetry and of the extraordinary simplicity of cylindrical gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>String loops and gravitational positivity bounds: imprint of light particles at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study loop corrections to positivity bounds on effective field theories in the context of $2\to 2$ scattering in gravitational theories, in the presence of light particles. It has been observed that certain negative contributions at low energies are enhanced by inverse powers of a small mass $m$ and are nontrivial to cancel against other low-energy contributions. These originate from near the forward limit of diagrams involving graviton exchange. We observe that scattering in this kinematics domain remains infrared-sensitive even at high center-of-mass energy. By considering a string-inspired model in which high-energy loops can be calculated using unitarity and Regge behavior of tree amplitudes, we uncover a natural mechanism through which $1/m$-enhanced terms perfectly cancel between low and high energy contributions. This concretely explains possible positivity violations in the presence of gravity from the high-energy viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Spin-Refined Partition Functions and $\mathcal{CRT}$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-refined partition functions in AdS/CFT using Euclidean gravitational path integrals. We construct phase diagrams for $Z_X = \text{Tr} \big( e^{-\beta H} X \big)$ in various dimensions and for different choices of discrete isometry $X$, discovering rich structures at finite temperature. When $X$ is a reflection, $Z_X$ counts the difference between the number of even- and odd-spin microstates. The high-temperature regime is universally dominated by $\mathcal{CRT}$-twisted black holes in any dimension, and in odd spacetime dimensions we examine whether complex rotating black hole solutions could contribute to spin-refined observables. We also analyze the microcanonical ensemble. There the leading contribution almost always come from rotating black holes, showing that the two ensembles are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalars in de Sitter space, computed in standard perturbation theory, are hindered by time-dependent infrared divergences in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing the expansion of space. It has often been pointed out that loop corrections to these correlation functions make their divergence even stronger. In this note, we argue that this is not the case: Loop corrections can be treated systematically with standard perturbative techniques (such as dimensional regularization) without necessarily introducing new $\ln a(t)$ dependencies. To be concrete, we focus on correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this case, divergences from loops can be removed systematically with counterterms order by order, and one finds that observable loop-corrected correlation functions are indistinguishable from their tree-level form. By adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we further point out that our results favor the use of physical cutoffs (as opposed to comoving cutoffs) to regularize infrared divergences in general diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops and vertices.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Chameleons, String Theory and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scenario with a transient phase of cosmological acceleration that could potentially be realized in asymptotic corners of String Theory moduli space. A very steep scalar potential is temporarily stabilized by the effect of a nonzero density of heavy states, leading to acceleration, in what amounts to a cosmological version of the Chameleon mechanism. The density of heavy states is diluted by cosmological expansion, weakening their effect. After roughly one $e$-fold their effect can no longer stabilize the potential, and the accelerating phase ends. We also study a scenario where there is no potential and the transient acceleration is achieved by the counterbalancing effects of light and heavy towers of states. In both cases we show that it is not possible to obtain more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ $e$-folds without transplanckian field excursions. We also discuss the general EFT constraints on these models and explore a number of first attempts at concrete embeddings of the scenario in String Theory. These all turn out to face significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Chiral Separation Effect from Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the chiral separation effect (CSE) in QCD by using the gauge/gravity duality. In QCD, this effect arises from a combination of chiral anomalies and the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Due to the axial gluon anomaly, the value of the CSE conductivity is not determined by the anomalies of QCD but receives radiative corrections, which leads to nontrivial dependence on temperature and density. To analyze this dependence, we use different variants of V-QCD, a complex holographic model, carefully fitted to QCD data. We find our results for the anomalous CSE conductivity at small chemical potential and nonzero temperature to be in good qualitative agreement with recent results from lattice QCD simulations. We furthermore give predictions for the behavior of the conductivity at finite (vectorial and axial) chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond the correspondence principle. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. This admits a representation in terms of a quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions for perturbative and non-perturbative periodic orbits, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum. This results in a path integral derivation of exact quantization conditions, complementary to the exact WKB analysis of differential equations. We apply these to generic $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetric multi-well potential problems and point out some new instanton effects, e.g., the level splitting is generically a multi-instanton effect, unlike double-well.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuation on the worldsheet of probe string in BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the second-order normal quantum fluctuation on the world-sheet of a probe string in the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. These fluctuations is treated as the projection of Hawking radiation on the worldsheet and indeed modify the action growth of the string. Then in the string field theory/boundary conformal field theory framework, via the boundary vertex operator we study the correlation function of the Schr\"odinger functional of excited fields on the world-sheet and further extract the field's formula. Our study could shed light on the potential connection between complexity growth and correlation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the generation of topological defects in the course of a dynamical phase transition in a ring with a weak link, i.e., a SSS Josephson junction, from the AdS/CFT correspondence. By setting different parameters of the junction (width, steepness, depth) and the final temperature of the quench, the configurations of the charge density and condensate of the order parameters of the dual field theory are presented. Meanwhile, we observe that in the final equilibrium state, variations in parameters of the junctions only affect the configurations of the charge density and condensate of the order parameters, without altering their values outside the junction. However, variations in the final temperature will directly affect the values of the charge density and condensate of the order parameters outside of the junction. Moreover, in the final equilibrium state, we propose an analytic relation between the gauge-invariant velocity in the two superconducting states in the SSS Josephson junction, which agrees well with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lorentz Symmetry Breaking in a Scale-free Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the renormalization of scale-free quadratic gravity coupled to the bumblebee field and its potential for dynamically breaking Lorentz symmetry. We conduct one-loop renormalization of the model and calculate the associated renormalization group functions. Additionally, we compute the one-loop effective potential for the bumblebee field, revealing that it acquires a non-trivial vacuum expectation value induced by radiative corrections - a phenomenon known as the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This spontaneous breaking of scale invariance arises from the non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field, implicating Lorentz symmetry violation. Consequently, the non-minimal coupling between the bumblebee and gravitational fields results in a spontaneous generation of the Einstein-Hilbert term due to radiative corrections, thereby linking the Planck scale to Lorentz violation phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the analytic description of complex no-boundary solutions in the context of inflation to large field models. We discuss the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion and find it is satisfied in small field models, while in large field models it depends on an integral involving $V'(\phi)$ over the range of inflation. It follows that the criterion does not truly constrain inflationary phenomenology since one can complete any inflaton potential beyond observable scales so as to satisfy KSW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry Theories (SymThs) provide a flexible framework for analyzing the global categorical symmetries of a $D$-dimensional QFT$_{D}$ in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system SymTh$_{D+1}$. In QFTs realized via local string backgrounds, these SymThs naturally arise from dimensional reduction of the linking boundary geometry. To track possible time dependent effects we introduce a celestial generalization of the standard "boundary at infinity" of a SymTh. As an application of these considerations we revisit large $N$ quiver gauge theories realized by spacetime filling D3-branes probing a non-supersymmetric orbifold $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Comparing the imprint of symmetry breaking on the celestial geometry at small and large 't Hooft coupling we find evidence for an intermediate symmetry preserving conformal fixed point.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Strange metal and superconductor in the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon $et$ $al$. (Nat. Comm. $\bf{14}$, 3033 (2023)). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Rotating Scalar and Vector Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic stars represent a hypothetical exotic type of compact stellar objects that could be observed from the gravitational signal of coalescing binaries in current and future gravitational wave detectors. There are two main families of bosonic stars, which depend on the nature that governs the particles that build them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon and Proca Stars. We study the multipolar structure for both families of rotating objects, using realistic potentials with the aim of finding possible universal relations and, thus, a method that allows us to distinguish between these and other compact objects in the gravitational wave paradigm. We also show how certain relevant observables can be obtained for these hypothetical but well-motivated astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Numerical fractional instantons in SU(2): center vortices, monopoles, and a sharp transition between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a numerical cooling algorithm to study fractional instantons in $SU(2)$ pure Yang-Mills on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$, $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$. We confirm that the fractional instantons are center vortices on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$ and monopoles on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and we calculate several properties relevant to using these solutions for semiclassical calculations. On $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$, we interpolate between the large $\mathbb{T}^2_*$ limit and the large $S^1$ limit to study how the solutions interpolate between center vortices and monopoles. We find that they are separated by a sharp transition, with 't Hooft's constant field strength solutions living at the transition point. These results contrast but do not contradict recent results suggesting continuity between vortices and monopoles.</description>

      <title>Classical electrodynamics as a tool to examine optical effects of chiral dielectrics and media with magnetic conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how classical electromagnetic techniques are useful to describe optical effects in conventional and chiral dielectric systems endowed with optical activity. Starting from the Maxwell equations and constitutive relations of the medium, we obtain the wave equation (for the electric field) that yields the refractive indices and the corresponding propagating modes that define the electromagnetic wave polarization. This procedure is employed for bi-isotropic and bi-anisotropic dielectrics, allowing us to determine birefringence, a manifestation of the space or time inversion breaking, typical of the chiral media. Such a method can also be applied for axion electrodynamics and a dielectric supporting an isotropic chiral magnetic current, similar to the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). For a diagonal magnetic conductivity, two distinct refractive indices are found, associated with left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) waves, and yielding circular birefringence (evaluated in terms of the optical rotatory power). Additionally, the scenario of a bi-isotropic medium endowed with isotropic magnetic current is examined, where a rotatory power marked by sign reversal may work as an optical signature of this particular system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes are evidently an essential component of the construction of a time machine. Within the context of general relativity, such objects require, for their formation, exotic matter -- matter that violates at least one of the standard energy conditions. Here, we explore the possibility that higher-curvature gravity theories might permit the construction of a wormhole without any matter at all. In particular, we consider the simplest form of a generalized quasi topological theory in four spacetime dimensions, known as Einsteinian Cubic Gravity. This theory has a number of promising features that make it an interesting phenomenological competitor to general relativity, including having non-hairy generalizations of the Schwarzschild black hole and linearized equations of second order around maximally symmetric backgrounds. By matching series solutions near the horizon and at large distances, we find evidence that strong asymptotically AdS wormhole solutions can be constructed, with strong curvature effects ensuring that the wormhole throat can exist.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of an $N$-Component Gas Mixture using the Chapman--Enskog Method under Anisotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman--Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green--Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component ``gluon gas." The Chapman--Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman--Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman--Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component ``binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity. In the context of post-Minkowskian expansion, the supertranslation ambiguity arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss to start at $\cO(G^2)$ or at $\cO(G^3)$ in gravitational scattering. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity at the linear order in post-Minkowskian expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss.</description>

      <title>Light rings and causality for nonsingular ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that, for certain ranges of the minimal length scale parameter, nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects may possess an odd number of light rings, contrary to what is expected based on topological arguments premised on matter satisfying the null energy condition. We comment on the interrelation of this result with respect to the necessity of violating the null energy condition for the formation of nonsingular ultracompact objects via gravitational collapse and discuss the viability of nonlinear electrodynamics as an effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

Abstract: This work presents analytical black hole solutions for a coupled Einstein-Born-Infeld-Scalar gravity system in AdS spacetime with two different non-minimal coupling functions $f(z)$. For both solutions, we establish the regularity of the scalar field and curvature scalars outside the horizon. For one of the considered coupling cases, thermodynamic analysis in the canonical ensemble reveals stability across all temperatures, while the other case exhibits the Hawking/Page phase transition between the stable large phase of the black hole and thermal-AdS. We investigate the effect of the scalar hair parameter and black hole charge on the phase transition temperature and observe that the critical values of the scalar hair and the charge parameters constrain the feasibility of Hawking/Page phase transition.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowsian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field equations of general relativity can be derived from the Einstein action, which is quadratic in connection coefficients, rather than the standard action involving the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and counterterm. We show that it is possible to construct a new counterterm directly for the Einstein action, which removes divergences and naturally introduces a flat reference spacetime. The total action is then covariant under simultaneous transformation of both the spacetime and reference tetrads, and argue that this is analogous to the Gibbons-Hawking action. We then explore different perspectives arising naturally from different uses of the reference tetrad, and explore implications of viewing gravity as fundamentally described in terms of non-covariant connection coefficients.</description>

      <title>Charged pion condensation and color superconductivity phenomena in chirally asymmetric dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the question of the influence of color superconductivity (CSC) on the formation of a phase with condensation of charged pions in dense chirally asymmetric quark matter is studied. We consider it within the framework of the massless NJL model with a diquark interaction channel at zero temperature, but in the presence of baryon $\mu_B$, isospin $\mu_I$, chiral $\mu_{5}$ and chiral isospin $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials. It has been shown in the mean-field approximation that in the presence of chiral imbalance, when $\mu_{5}\ne 0$ and/or $\mu_{I5}\ne 0$, CSC phenomenon does not hinder the generation of charged pion condensation in dense quark matter even at largest baryon densities attainable in heavy ion collisions experiments and in cores of neutron stars and its mergers. So charged pion condensation in dense quark matter with chiral imbalance predicted earlier is not in a bit suppressed by the presence of CSC, highlighting the resilience of this phase in dense quark matter. This makes phase structure of dense quark matter even more rich, multifaceted and interesting, and shows that pion condensation in dense quark matter is viable phenomenon to be explored, for example, in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the information paradox of Reissner-Nordstr${\ddot{o}}$m anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS$_{d+1}$) black holes in the large dimension limit by using the island formula. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is calculated both for the non-extremal and the extremal cases, in which the boundary of the radiation region is close to the outer horizon. For the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation obeys the Page curve, i.e. the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time and reaches saturation about twice Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the Page time. For the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation becomes ill-defined in the absence of the island due to the appearance of the singularity at the origin of the radial coordinate, while when the island exists, the entanglement entropy is found to be equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, for the case where the boundary of the radiation region is close to the horizon, there are some obvious constraints required by the existence of island solution for both non-extremal and extremal cases, which can be utilized to put constraints on the size of the black hole. These results reveal new features of the semi-classical large $d$ black holes from the island perspective.</description>

Abstract: We study a parametric deformation of the unified genus-1 anharmonic potential and derive a parametric form of perturbative/non-perturbative (P/NP) relation, applicable across all parameter values. We explicitly demonstrate that the perturbative expansion around the perturbative saddle is sufficient to generate all the nonperturbative information in these systems. Our results confirm the known results in the literature, where the cubic and quartic anharmonic potentials are reproduced under extreme parameter values, and go beyond these known results by developing the nonperturbative function of real and complex instantons solely from perturbative data.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Asymptotic Behavior of S-matrix Elements from their Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic kinematic limits of S-matrices are dominated by large logarithms which, roughly speaking, fall into two categories: those which are controlled by a renormalization group (RG) scale, which we may think of as logs involving ratios of invariant mass scales, and those which are functions of ratios of rapidities, so called "rapidity logs". It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a regular bound state of two extremal black holes in type IIB supergravity with opposite charges. The bound state resembles the Schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotics to the photon ring and has the same mass and charges as the Schwarzschild black hole. On the one hand, we show that the bound-state entropy admits a microscopic description in terms of branes and antibranes in string theory. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the entropy approaches half of the Schwarzschild entropy as the mass becomes significantly larger than the Kaluza-Klein scales used to regularize the geometry. This opens up the possibility of a brane/antibrane interpretation of the Schwarzschild entropy in string theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of IR divergences and holography in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a renormalisation procedure for IR divergences of tree-level in-in late-time de Sitter correlators. These divergences are due to the infinite volume of spacetime and are analogous to the divergences that appear in AdS dealt with by holographic renormalisation. Regulating the theory using dimensional regularisation, we show that one can remove all infinities by adding local counterterms at the future boundary of dS in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral. The counterterms amount to renormalising the late-time bulk field. We frame the discussion in terms of bulk scalar fields in dS, using tree-level correlators of massless and conformal scalars for illustration. The relation to AdS via analytic continuation is discussed, and we show that different versions of the analytic continuation appearing in the literature are equivalent to each other. In AdS, one needs to add counterterms that are related to conformal anomalies, and also to renormalise the source part of the bulk field. The analytic continuation to dS projects out the traditional AdS counterterms, and links the renormalisation of the sources to the renormalisation of the late-time bulk field. We use these results to establish holographic formulae that relate tree-level dS in-in correlators to CFT correlators at up to four points, and we provide two proofs: one using the connection between the dS wavefunction and the partition function of the dual CFT, and a second by direct evaluation of the in-in correlators using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. The renormalisation of the bulk IR divergences is mapped by these formulae to UV renormalisation of the dual CFT via local counterterms, providing structural support for a possible duality. We also recast the regulated holographic formulae in terms of the AdS amplitudes of shadow fields, but show that this relation breaks down when renormalisation is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate probe scalar field models preserving covariance on fixed, static background geometries that present hyperscaling violation properties. We develop a first-order framework that rises from restrictions on the dynamical and hyperscaling violating exponents. The results show that stable, analytical kink-like solutions and their respective energy densities can be obtained for a general class of models. In the canonical model, in particular, these solutions minimize the energy of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the teleparallel dynamics for extended geometry where the structure algebra is (an extension of) an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra. This provides a geometrisation of the Geroch symmetry appearing on dimensional reduction of a gravitational theory to two dimensions. The formalism is adapted to the underlying tensor hierarchy algebra, and will serve as a stepping stone towards the geometrisation of other infinite-dimensional, e.g. hyperbolic, symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the loop equation for the 1-matrix model with generic difference-type measure for eigenvalues and develop a recursive algebraic framework for solving it to an arbitrary order in the coupling constant in and beyond the planar approximation. The planar limit is solved exactly for a one-parametric family of models and in the general case at strong coupling. The Wilson loop in the N=2* super-Yang-Mills theory and the Hoppe model are used to illustrate our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed and systematic formulation of Carrollian relativity is provided. Based on the transformations, first provided by Sengupta [19], we construct a mapping between Lorentz relativistic and Carrollian relativistic vectors. Using this map the Carroll theory is built from the standard Maxwell action. We show that we get self-consistent equations of motion from the action, both in electric and magnetic limits. We introduce Carroll electric and magnetic fields. A new set of maps is derived that connects Carroll electric and magnetic fields with the usual Maxwell ones and yields Carroll equations in terms of fields. Consistency of results with the potential formulation is shown. Carroll version of symmetries like duality, gauge, shift, Noether and boost are treated in details and their implications elaborated. Especially, boost symmetry provides a link to the various maps used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomalies of Maximally Supersymmetric Tensor Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a) \supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Negative Action Keldysh Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss quantization of Dirac spinors with action which is the negative of the standard action. Using the Keldysh QFT formulation, we show that the standard quantization of such Keldysh spinors results in the Hamiltonian bounded from above and in S-matrix for backwards in time scattering. The alternative quantization produces the standard Hamiltonian bounded from below and the standard S-matrix for forwards in time scattering. When the two masses are equal, the sum of their actions describes the standard Keldysh out-of-time-order correlators. When both Keldysh and Dirac spinors are present in a QFT, the standard Fock space is augmented by negative energy states, while its positive and the negative subspaces share the same vacuum state. In absence of gravity the Dirac and the Keldysh spinors do not interact and positive and negative energy states do not exchange quanta with non-zero energy. If Keldysh spinors exist in Nature, then the Universe would consist of bosonic and fermionic particles that are described by both positive and negative Fock energy states with a single vacuum state that cannot be crossed from either side. Such a scenario could explain the non-observation of dark energy/dark matter except via classical gravity.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic Kac-Moody Calogero model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new kind of quantum Calogero model is proposed, based on a hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra. We formulate nonrelativistic quantum mechanics on the Minkowskian root space of the simplest rank-3 hyperbolic Lie algebra $AE_3$ with an inverse-square potential given by its real roots and reduce it to the unit future hyperboloid. By stereographic projection this defines a quantum mechanics on the Poincar\'e disk with a unique potential. Since the Weyl group of $AE_3$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of the modular group PSL(2,$\mathbb{Z}_2$), the model is naturally formulated on the complex upper half plane, and its potential is a real modular function. We present and illustrate the relevant features of $AE_3$, give some approximations to the potential and rewrite it as an (almost everywhere convergent) Poincar\'e series. The standard Dunkl operators are constructed and investigated on Minkowski space and on the hyperboloid. In the former case find that their commutativity is obstructed by rank-2 subgroups of hyperbolic type (the simplest one given by the Fibonacci sequence), casting doubt on the integrability of the model. An appendix with Don Zagier investigates the computability of the potential. We foresee applications to cosmological billards and to quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are one of the simplest, yet nontrivial, gapped systems that go beyond the Landau paradigm. In this work, we study an extension of the notion of SPT for gapless systems, namely, gapless symmetry protected topological states. We construct several simple gapless-SPT models using the decorated defect construction, which allow analytical understanding of non-trivial topological features including the symmetry charge under twisted boundary conditions, and boundary (quasi)-degeneracy under open boundary conditions. We also comment on the stability of the gapless-SPT models under symmetric perturbations, and apply small-scale exact diagonalization when direct analytic understanding is not available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on how the production and polarization of gravitational waves are affected by spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking, which is driven by a self-interacting vector field. Specifically, we examine the impact of a smooth quadratic potential and a non-minimal coupling, discussing the constraints and causality features of the linearized Einstein equation. To analyze the polarization states of a plane wave, we consider a fixed vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the vector field. Remarkably, we verify that a space-like background vector field modifies the polarization plane and introduces a longitudinal degree of freedom. In order to investigate the Lorentz violation effect on the quadrupole formula, we use the modified Green function. Finally, we show that the space-like component of the background field leads to a third-order time derivative of the quadrupole moment, and the bounds for the Lorentz-breaking coefficients are estimated as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of anharmonicity in quantum anharmonic oscillators, by computing the energy gap between the ground and the 1st excited state using the numerical bootstrap method. Based on perturbative formulae of limiting coupling regimes, we propose a qualitative formula of the energy gap across all coupling values. Except detailed numerical parameter values, the proposed formula has the same functional form as the formula of ground state level splitting of double-well potentials, proposed recently in arXiv:2308.11516. This unifies the effects of anharmonicity in both the anharmonic oscillators and the double-well potentials, although the underlying physical process of them are completely different. We give an explanation of this connection of their anharmonicity from the viewpoint of quantum phase transitions. This connection is justified up to the octic anharmonicities by the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully-connected deep neural networks with weights initialized from independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network. However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth, to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that, at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$, rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations. We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed in deep networks with depth comparable to width. We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification tasks.</description>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiativegravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for cosmic ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of this association to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, considering cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, including energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: The accessibility of the Hawking-Page transition in AdS$_5$ through a 1d Heisenberg spin chain is demonstrated. We use the random matrix formulation of the Loschmidt echo for a set of spin chains, and randomize the ferromagnetic spin interaction. It is shown that the thermal Loschmidt echo, when averaged, detects the predicted increase in entropy across the Hawking-Page transition. This suggests that a 1d spin chain exhibits characteristics of black hole physics in 4+1 dimensions. We show that this approach is equally applicable to free fermion systems with a general dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I introduce a systematic procedure for constructing complete and independent sets of interactions of fields transforming under exotic representations of SU(N), in particular the SU(3) gauge group of QCD. It uncovers errors in previous results, starting with interactions of four fields including a single sextet.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated two distinct models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in scattering processes of $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$. We verified that employing the model with dual electromagnetic tensor $(\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu})$ led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. Conversely, utilizing the model with nonminimal coupling with $(F_{\mu\nu})$ preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. Consequently, this could hold promising implications, considering that the nonminimal coupling model with dual electromagnetic tensor $\tilde {F}_{\mu\nu}$ appeared potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we anticipate that these findings might offer a valuable roadmap for further exploration into the investigation of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with phenomenological implications that are certainly not trivial.</description>

      <title>The magic of entangled top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This raises the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>
