      <title>Life at low Reynolds number isn't such a drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20648v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>

      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. For small active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension settles to an equilibrium state with uniform alignment. Beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension instead can buckle into a steady flowing state. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, however, the development is arrested by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber emerge at yet higher values of active Ericksen number. If the active particles are motile, traveling waves emerge, including a traveling, oscillatory `thrashing' state. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the arrested state.</description>

      <title>Persistent pseudopod splitting is an effective chemotaxis strategy in shallow gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell organisms and various cell types use a range of motility modes when following a chemical gradient, but it is unclear which mode is best suited for different gradients. Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.</description>
