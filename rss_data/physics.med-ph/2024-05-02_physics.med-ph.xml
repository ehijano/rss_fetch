      <title>Fast MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Learning-based Compressed Sensing: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized medical imaging, providing a non-invasive and highly detailed look into the human body. However, the long acquisition times of MRI present challenges, causing patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various techniques to reduce acquisition time and improve the overall efficiency of MRI. One such technique is compressed sensing (CS), which reduces data acquisition by leveraging image sparsity in transformed spaces. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been integrated with CS-MRI, leading to a new framework that has seen remarkable growth. DL-based CS-MRI approaches are proving to be highly effective in accelerating MR imaging without compromising image quality. This review comprehensively examines DL-based CS-MRI techniques, focusing on their role in increasing MR imaging speed. We provide a detailed analysis of each category of DL-based CS-MRI including end-to-end, unroll optimization, self-supervised, and federated learning. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the exciting potential of DL in CS-MRI. Additionally, our systematic review efficiently summarizes key results and trends in DL-based CS-MRI including quantitative metrics, the dataset used, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based CS-MRI in the advancement of medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based CS-MRI publications and publicly available datasets - https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Dark-Field CT for Lung Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: X-ray grating-based dark-field imaging can sense the small angle scattering caused by an object's micro-structure. This technique is sensitive to lung's porous alveoli and is able to detect lung disease at an early stage. Up to now, a human-scale dark-field CT has been built for lung imaging. Purpose: This study aimed to develop a more thorough optimization method for dark-field lung CT and summarize principles for system design. Methods: We proposed a metric in the form of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for system parameter optimization, and designed a phantom with concentric circle shape to fit the task of lung disease detection. Finally, we developed the calculation method of the CNR metric, and analyzed the relation between CNR and system parameters. Results: We showed that with other parameters held constant, the CNR first increases and then decreases with the system auto-correlation length (ACL). The optimal ACL is nearly not influenced by system's visibility, and is only related to phantom's property, i.e., scattering material's size and phantom's absorption. For our phantom, the optimal ACL is about 0.21 {\mu}m. As for system geometry, larger source-detector and isocenter-detector distance can increase the system's maximal ACL, helping the system meet the optimal ACL more easily. Conclusions: This study proposed a more reasonable metric and a task-based process for optimization, and demonstrated that the system optimal ACL is only related to the phantom's property.</description>

      <title>Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for extracting and modelling organ motion. However, when significant changes and sliding boundaries are present, it faces compromised accuracy and uncertainty, determining the subsequential contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures. Materials and methods: We propose an implicit neural representation (INR)-based approach modelling motion continuously in both space and time, named Continues-sPatial-Temporal DIR (CPT-DIR). This method uses a multilayer perception (MLP) network to map 3D coordinate (x,y,z) to its corresponding velocity vector (vx,vy,vz). The displacement vectors (dx,dy,dz) are then calculated by integrating velocity vectors over time. The MLP's parameters can rapidly adapt to new cases without pre-training, enhancing optimisation. The DIR's performance was tested on the DIR-Lab dataset of 10 lung 4DCT cases, using metrics of landmark accuracy (TRE), contour conformity (Dice) and image similarity (MAE). Results: The proposed CPT-DIR can reduce landmark TRE from 2.79mm to 0.99mm, outperforming B-splines' results for all cases. The MAE of the whole-body region improves from 35.46HU to 28.99HU. Furthermore, CPT-DIR surpasses B-splines for accuracy in the sliding boundary region, lowering MAE and increasing Dice coefficients for the ribcage from 65.65HU and 90.41% to 42.04HU and 90.56%, versus 75.40HU and 89.30% without registration. Meanwhile, CPT-DIR offers significant speed advantages, completing in under 15 seconds compared to a few minutes with the conventional B-splines method. Conclusion: Leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration accuracy, automation and speed, outperforming traditional B-splines in landmark and contour precision, particularly in the challenging areas.</description>

      <title>Screening of BindingDB database ligands against EGFR, HER2, Estrogen, Progesterone and NF-kB receptors based on machine learning and molecular docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer, the second most prevalent cancer among women worldwide, necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. To target the four subgroups of breast cancer "hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive, hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive, and hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative" it is crucial to inhibit specific targets such as EGFR, HER2, ER, NF-kB, and PR.
  In this study, we evaluated various methods for binary and multiclass classification. Among them, the GA-SVM-SVM:GA-SVM-SVM model was selected with an accuracy of 0.74, an F1-score of 0.73, and an AUC of 0.94 for virtual screening of ligands from the BindingDB database. This model successfully identified 4454, 803, 438, and 378 ligands with over 90% precision in both active/inactive and target prediction for the classes of EGFR+HER2, ER, NF-kB, and PR, respectively, from the BindingDB database. Based on to the selected ligands, we created a dendrogram that categorizes different ligands based on their targets. This dendrogram aims to facilitate the exploration of chemical space for various therapeutic targets.
  Ligands that surpassed a 90% threshold in the product of activity probability and correct target selection probability were chosen for further investigation using molecular docking. The binding energy range for these ligands against their respective targets was calculated to be between -15 and -5 kcal/mol. Finally, based on general and common rules in medicinal chemistry, we selected 2, 3, 3, and 8 new ligands with high priority for further studies in the EGFR+HER2, ER, NF-kB, and PR classes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation addresses challenges in diagnosing myasthenia gravis, a condition associated with high mortality rates. Employing the SERS method, blood serum samples were analyzed on quartz glass with implanted gold nanoparticles of about 5 nm. Minuscule dimensions of nanoparticles contribute to the heightened enhancement of Raman signals through interband transitions. The enhanced signals facilitated the detection of peaks observed solely in the blood serum of patients suffering from myasthenia gravis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Super-Resolution Networks through Realistic Thick-Slice CT Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Generative Models have the potential to convert low-resolution CT images into high-resolution counterparts without long acquisition times and increased radiation exposure in thin-slice CT imaging. However, procuring appropriate training data for these Super-Resolution (SR) models is challenging. Previous SR research has simulated thick-slice CT images from thin-slice CT images to create training pairs. However, these methods either rely on simplistic interpolation techniques that lack realism or sinogram reconstruction, which require the release of raw data and complex reconstruction algorithms. Thus, we introduce a simple yet realistic method to generate thick CT images from thin-slice CT images, facilitating the creation of training pairs for SR algorithms. The training pairs produced by our method closely resemble real data distributions (PSNR=49.74 vs. 40.66, p$&lt;$0.05). A multivariate Cox regression analysis involving thick slice CT images with lung fibrosis revealed that only the radiomics features extracted using our method demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality (HR=1.19 and HR=1.14, p$&lt;$0.005). This paper represents the first to identify and address the challenge of generating appropriate paired training data for Deep Learning-based CT SR models, which enhances the efficacy and applicability of SR models in real-world scenarios.</description>
