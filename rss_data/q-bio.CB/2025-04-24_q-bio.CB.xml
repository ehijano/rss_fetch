      <title>Using mathematical models of heart cells to assess the safety of new pharmaceutical drugs</title>

Abstract: Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide, at a cost of billions of dollars, because of patient fatalities due to them unexpectedly disturbing heart rhythm. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been withdrawn due to an unacceptable increase in risk of these heart rhythm disturbances. Consequently, the whole pharmaceutical industry expends a huge effort in checking all new drugs for any unwanted side effects on the heart. The predominant root cause has been identified as drug molecules blocking ionic current flows in the heart. Block of individual types of ionic currents can now be measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is the standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the degree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is difficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently. By using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of heart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from different types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and subsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more accurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more cheaply than the pre-existing approaches.</description>
