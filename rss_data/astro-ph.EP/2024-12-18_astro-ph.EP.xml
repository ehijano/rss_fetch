      <title>Creating Pileups of Eccentric Planet Pairs Wide of MMRs Through Divergent Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed pileups of planets with period ratios $\approx 1\%$ wide of strong mean motion resonances (MMRs) pose an important puzzle. Early models showed that they can be created through sustained eccentricity damping driving a slow separation of the orbits, but this picture is inconsistent with elevated eccentricities measured through Transit Timing Variations. We argue that any source of divergent migration (tides, planet-disk interactions etc.) will cause planets that encounter an MMR to both jump over it (piling up wide of resonance) and get a kick to their free eccentricity. We find that the jumps in eccentricity expected from slow MMR crossings are sufficient (but mostly too large) to explain the free eccentricities measured through TTVs. We argue that this mechanism can be brought in line with observations if MMR crossings are not adiabatic and/or through residual eccentricity damping.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI reveals a peculiar CO$_2$-rich chemistry in the drift-dominated disk CX Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial drift of icy pebbles can have a large impact on the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Compact dust disks ($\lesssim$50 au) are suggested to have a higher (cold) H$_2$O flux than more extended disks, likely due to efficient radial drift bringing H$_2$O-rich material to the inner disk, where it can be observed with JWST. We present JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the disk CX Tau taken as a part of the Mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO program, a prime example of a drift-dominated disk. This compact disk seems peculiar: the source possesses a bright CO$_2$ feature instead of the bright H$_2$O expected based on its efficient radial drift. We aim to provide an explanation for this finding. We detect molecular emission from H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and OH in this disk, and even demonstrate a potential detection of CO$^{18}$O. Analysis of the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ emission shows the former to be tracing a temperature of $\sim$450 K, whereas the $^{13}$CO$_2$ traces a significantly colder temperature ($\sim$200 K). H$_2$O is also securely detected both at shorter and longer wavelengths, tracing a similar temperature of $\sim$500-600 K as the CO$_2$ emission. We also find evidence for a colder, $\sim$200 K H$_2$O component at longer wavelengths, which is in line with this disk having strong radial drift. The cold $^{13}$CO$_2$ and H$_2$O emission indicate that radial drift of ices likely plays an important role in setting the chemistry of the inner disk of CX Tau. Potentially, the H$_2$O-rich gas has already advected onto the central star, which is now followed by an enhancement of comparatively CO$_2$-rich gas reaching the inner disk, explaining the enhancement of CO$_2$ emission in CX Tau. The comparatively weaker H$_2$O emission can be explained by the source's low accretion luminosity. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Orbital evolution of the P/1996 R2 and P/1996 N2 objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical integration of the equations of motion of the Sun-planets-an object system is used to study the evolution of orbits close to the orbit of the P/1996 R2 object, which is a Jupiter-crossing object, and to the asteroidal orbit of the P/1996 N2 object, which, at the moment of its detection, had a tail similar to a cometary one. Small variations in the initial data considerably affect the evolution of orbits close to that of the P/1996 R2 object. The time elapsed up to the ejection of the object into a hyperbolic orbit varied from 3*10^4 to 2.7*10^7 yr. Some objects were in resonances with Jupiter and Saturn for a long time. For about 20 percent of the runs, objects reached the Earth's orbit during evolution. Orbital elements of the P/1996 N2 object changed quasi-periodically over the considered time span of 200 Myr. Variations in the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination were equal to 0.04 AU, 0.11 deg, and 3.5 deg, respectively.</description>

      <title>How much earlier would LSST have discovered currently known long-period comets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive population, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the more pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the formation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific investigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025, is expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by performing regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5 with excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on future LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the underlying population. This is because identifications to date have been conducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed information on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict incoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic, well-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different point of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or hyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was already in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are not simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach the perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like survey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of comets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at double (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on this approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the current discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic tidal dissipation in misaligned planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tides are the main driving force behind the long-term evolution of planetary systems. The associated energy dissipation and momentum exchanges are commonly described by Love numbers, which relate the exciting potential to the tidally perturbed potential. These transfer functions are generally assumed to depend solely on tidal frequency and body rheology, following the isotropic assumption, which presumes invariance of properties by rotation about the centre of mass. We examine the limitations of the isotropic assumption for fluid bodies, where Coriolis acceleration breaks spherical symmetry, resulting in rotational scattering and complex tidal responses. Using angular momentum theory, we derive a new formalism to calculate the tidal rates of energy and momentum transfers in non-isotropic cases. We apply this formalism to the Earth-Moon system to assess the effects of anisotropy in planet-satellite systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta. Our findings indicate that the isotropic assumption can introduce significant errors in planetary evolution models, particularly in the dynamical tide regime. These errors stem from forced wave resonances, with inaccuracies in energy dissipation scaling in proportion to resonance amplification factors.</description>

      <title>SF2A Environmental Transition Commission: Towards a desirable future for research in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the scope of our occupation. Since 2021, thinking on this subject has progressed significantly, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This year was an opportunity to take stock of the main areas of reflection that we need to keep in mind in order to implement a fair, collective and effective environmental transition. This proceeding summarizes the key points from the plenary session related to the environmental transition special session. The purpose of the messages disseminated here is to suggest ideas for reflection and inspiration, so as to initiate, stimulate, and foster discussions within the A&amp;A research community, towards the implementation of concrete measures to mitigate our environmental footprint.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs IX. Multiplicity from close spectroscopic binaries to ultra-wide systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicity studies greatly benefit from focusing on M dwarfs because they are often paired in a variety of configurations with both stellar and substellar objects, including exoplanets. We aim to address the observed multiplicity of M dwarfs by conducting a systematic analysis using the latest available astrophotometric data. For every star in a sample of 2214 M dwarfs from the CARMENES catalogue, we investigated the existence of resolved and unresolved physical companions in the literature and in all-sky surveys, especially in Gaia DR3 data products. We covered a very wide range of separations, from known spectroscopic binaries in tight arrangements $\sim$0.01 au to remarkably separated ultra-wide pairs ($\sim$10$^5$ au). We identified 835 M dwarfs in 720 multiple systems, predominantly binaries. Thus, we propose 327 new binary candidates based on Gaia data. If these candidates are finally confirmed, we expect the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs to be 40.3$^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ %. When only considering the systems already identified, the multiplicity fraction is reduced to 27.8$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ %. This result is in line with most of the values published in the literature. We also identified M-dwarf multiple systems with FGK, white dwarf, ultra-cool dwarf, and exoplanet companions, as well as those in young stellar kinematic groups. We studied their physical separations, orbital periods, binding energies, and mass ratios. We argue that based on reliable astrometric data and spectroscopic investigations from the literature (even when considering detection biases), the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs could still be significantly underestimated. This calls for further high-resolution follow-up studies to validate these findings.</description>

      <title>Laboratory modeling of MHD accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Analytical Approach for Determining Eclipses of Satellites Occulted by a Celestial Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to construct an analytical model for determining the total duration of eclipse events of satellites. The approach assumes that the trace formed in the orbital plane, cutting body shadow under the classical conical shadow model, can be described as an ellipse. This allows for the derivation of its parameters through the use of classical orbital elements and solar position in the body-centric frame. Consequently, the problem of identifying satellite occultation events is simplified to searching for points of intersection between two ellipses: the satellite orbit and the shadow. The developed model has been demonstrated to be applicable for a wide range of inclinations, with the exception of cases where the orbital plane of the satellite motion coincides with that of the sun in the body-centric frame. It is shown that the shadow function constructed under the aforementioned assumptions can be simplified in the cylindrical shadow model. Several simplifications to the proposed model are presented in the study. The paper also considers extending the model to account for non-spherical shapes of celestial bodies, i.e., bodies with oblateness, and presents an algorithm that accounts for changes in eclipse duration due to the heliocentric motion of these celestial bodies. The model has been validated through numerous tests with a numerical algorithm and satellite real data, as well as with other analytical models.</description>

      <title>Stellar flare morphology with TESS across the main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are abundant in space photometric light curves. As they are now available in large enough numbers, the statistical study of their overall temporal morphology is timely. We use light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the shapes of stellar flares beyond a simple parameterization by duration and amplitude, and reveal possible connections to astrophysical parameters. We retrain and use the flatwrm2 long-short term memory neural network to find stellar flares in 2-min cadence TESS light curves from the first five years of the mission (sectors 1-69). We scale these flares to a comparable standard shape, and use principal component analysis to describe their temporal morphology in a concise way. We investigate how the flare shapes change along the main sequence, and test whether individual flares hold any information about their host stars. We also apply similar techniques to solar flares, using extreme ultraviolet irradiation time series. Our final catalog contains ~120,000 flares on ~14,000 stars. Due to the strict filtering and the final manual vetting, this sample contains virtually no false positives, although at the expense of reduced completeness. Using this flare catalog, we detect a dependence of the average flare shape on the spectral type. These changes are not apparent for individual flares, only when averaging thousands of events. We find no strong clustering in the flare shape space. We create new analytical flare templates for different types of stars, present a technique to sample realistic flares, and a method to locate flares with similar shapes. The flare catalog, along with the extracted flare shapes, and the data used to train flatwrm2 are publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a ``fuzzy core" of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably-stratified regions now demanded by the \textit{Juno} gravity data. Hence, using the new code \texttt{APPLE}, we attempt to put a non-adiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the \textit{Juno} data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.</description>

Abstract: Planet formation encompasses processes that span a remarkable 40 magnitudes in mass, ranging from collisions between micron-sized grains inherited from the ISM to the accretion of gas by giant planets. The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its own self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by the growth of solid bodies. The core accretion model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later stages of the core accretion model involve the emergence of protoplanets from the planetesimal population, which accretes smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-1609Lb: Sub-jovian planet orbiting a low-mass stellar or brown dwarf host</title>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Induced Rings and Gaps within Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the presence of both crescent-shaped and ring-like structures in dust continuum emission. These crescents are thought to arise from dust-trapping vortices generated by the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI), which induces density waves akin to those caused by planets. These vortices have the potential to create gaps and rings within the disk, resulting from the dissipation of their density waves. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations in the shearing box to investigate vortex-disk interaction. We find that long-lived vortices can produce dust rings and gaps in inviscid discs detectable by ALMA, and a more elongated vortex produces rings at larger separations. Vortex-induced density waves carry over two orders of magnitude higher angular momentum flux compared to planet-induced ones that shock at the same location, making the former much more effective at producing dust gaps and rings far away.</description>
