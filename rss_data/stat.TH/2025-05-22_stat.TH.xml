      <title>Semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorems for reversible diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem for Bayesian nonparametric priors based on continuous observations in a periodic reversible multidimensional diffusion model. We consider a wide range of functionals satisfying an approximate linearization condition, including several nonlinear functionals of the invariant measure. Our result is applied to Gaussian and Besov-Laplace priors, showing these can perform efficient semiparametric inference and thus justifying the corresponding Bayesian approach to uncertainty quantification. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Covariance matrix estimation in the singular case using regularized Cholesky factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its spectrum.</description>

      <title>Sharp Asymptotic Minimaxity for One-Group Priors in Sparse Normal Means Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of the Bayesian multiple testing rules when the mean parameter of the sparse normal means problem is modeled by a broad class of global-local priors, expressed as a scale mixture of normals. We are interested in studying the least possible risk, i.e., the minimax risk for two frequentist losses, one being the usual misclassification (or Hamming) loss, and the other one, measured as the sum of FDR and FNR. Under the betamin separation condition, at first, assuming the level of sparsity to be known, we propose a condition on the global parameter of our chosen class of priors, such that the resultant decision rule attains the minimax risk for both of the losses mentioned above. When the level of sparsity is unknown, we either use an estimate of the global parameter obtained from the data, or propose an absolutely continuous prior on it. For both of the procedures, under some assumption on the unknown level of sparsity, we show that the decision rules also attain the minimax risk, again for both of the losses. Our results also provide a guideline regarding the selection of priors, in the sense that beyond a subclass(horseshoe type priors) of our chosen class of priors, the minimax risk is not achievable with respect to any one of the two loss functions considered in this article. However, the subclass, horseshoe-type priors, is such a large subclass that it contains Horseshoe, Strawderman Berger, standard double Pareto, inverse gamma priors, just to name a few. In this way, along with the most popular BH procedure and approach using spike and slab prior, a multiple testing rule based on one group priors also achieves the optimal boundary. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results in the literature of global local priors which ensure the optimal minimax risk can be achieved exactly.</description>

      <title>Grassmann and Flag Varieties in Linear Algebra, Optimization, and Statistics: An Algebraic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassmann and flag varieties lead many lives in pure and applied mathematics. Here we focus on the algebraic complexity of solving various problems in linear algebra and statistics as optimization problems over these varieties. The measure of the algebraic complexity is the amount of complex critical points of the corresponding optimization problem. After an exposition of different realizations of these manifolds as algebraic varieties we present a sample of optimization problems over them and we compute their algebraic complexity.</description>

      <title>Controlling the false discovery rate in high-dimensional linear models using model-X knockoffs and $p$-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose novel multiple testing methods for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in the context of high-dimensional linear models. Our development innovatively integrates model-X knockoff techniques with debiased penalized regression estimators. The proposed approach addresses two fundamental challenges in high-dimensional statistical inference: (i) constructing valid test statistics and corresponding $p$-values in solving problems with a diverging number of model parameters, and (ii) ensuring FDR control under complex and unknown dependence structures among test statistics. A central contribution of our methodology lies in the rigorous construction and theoretical analysis of two paired sets of test statistics. Based on these test statistics, our methodology adopts two $p$-value-based multiple testing algorithms. The first applies the conventional Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, justified by the asymptotic mutual independence and normality of one set of the test statistics. The second leverages the paired structure of both sets of test statistics to improve detection power while maintaining rigorous FDR control. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, establishing the validity of the debiasing framework and ensuring that the proposed methods achieve proper FDR control. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our procedures outperform existing approaches - particularly those relying on empirical evaluations of false discovery proportions - in terms of both power and empirical control of the FDR. Notably, our methodology yields substantial improvements in settings characterized by weaker signals, smaller sample sizes, and lower pre-specified FDR levels.</description>

      <title>Directional Convergence, Benign Overfitting of Gradient Descent in leaky ReLU two-layer Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove directional convergence of network parameters of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks optimized by gradient descent with exponential loss, which was previously only known for gradient flow. By a careful analysis of the convergent direction, we establish sufficient conditions of benign overfitting and discover a new phase transition in the test error bound. All of these results hold beyond the nearly orthogonal data setting which was studied in prior works. As an application, we demonstrate that benign overfitting occurs with high probability in sub-Gaussian mixture models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Power Priors for Improved Bayesian Inference with Historical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's $\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions, offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate risk-averse and distributionally robust modeling of Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) and Markov Decision Process (MDP). We discuss construction of conditional nested risk functionals, a particular attention is given to the Value-at-Risk measure. Necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of non-randomized optimal policies in the framework of robust SOC and MDP are derived.

      <title>Sharp concentration of uniform generalization errors in binary linear classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under dimension-free conditions.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study the time-dependent correlation function of the one-dimensional impenetrable Bose gas, which can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm determinant of a time-dependent sine kernel and the solutions of the separated NLS equations. We derive the large time and distance asymptotic expansions of this determinant and the solutions of the separated NLS equations in both the space-like region and time-like region of the $(x,t)$-plane. Furthermore, we observe a phase transition between the asymptotic expansions in these two different regions. The phase transition is then shown to be described by a particular solution of the Painlev\'e IV equation.</description>

      <title>Causality Pursuit from Heterogeneous Environments via Neural Adversarial Invariance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pursuing causality from data is a fundamental problem in scientific discovery, treatment intervention, and transfer learning. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic method for addressing nonparametric invariance and causality learning in regression models across multiple environments, where the joint distribution of response variables and covariates varies, but the conditional expectations of outcome given an unknown set of quasi-causal variables are invariant. The challenge of finding such an unknown set of quasi-causal or invariant variables is compounded by the presence of endogenous variables that have heterogeneous effects across different environments. The proposed Focused Adversarial Invariant Regularization (FAIR) framework utilizes an innovative minimax optimization approach that drives regression models toward prediction-invariant solutions through adversarial testing. Leveraging the representation power of neural networks, FAIR neural networks (FAIR-NN) are introduced for causality pursuit. It is shown that FAIR-NN can find the invariant variables and quasi-causal variables under a minimal identification condition and that the resulting procedure is adaptive to low-dimensional composition structures in a non-asymptotic analysis. Under a structural causal model, variables identified by FAIR-NN represent pragmatic causality and provably align with exact causal mechanisms under conditions of sufficient heterogeneity. Computationally, FAIR-NN employs a novel Gumbel approximation with decreased temperature and a stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm. The procedures are demonstrated using simulated and real-data examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study predictive probability inference in classification tasks using random forests under class imbalance. We focus on two simplified variants of Breiman's algorithm, namely subsampling Infinite Random Forests (IRFs) and under-sampling IRFs, and establish their asymptotic normality. In the under-sampling setting, training data from both classes are resampled to achieve balance, which enhances minority class representation but introduces a biased model. To correct this, we propose a debiasing procedure based on Importance Sampling (IS) using odds ratios. We instantiate our results using 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) classifiers as base learners in the IRFs and prove the nearly minimax optimality of the approach for Lipschitz continuous objectives. We also show that the IS bagged 1-NN estimator matches the convergence rate of its subsampled counterpart while attaining lower asymptotic variance in most cases. Our theoretical findings are supported by simulation studies, highlighting the empirical benefits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, denoising diffusion models have become a crucial area of research due to their abundance in the rapidly expanding field of generative AI. While recent statistical advances have delivered explanations for the generation ability of idealised denoising diffusion models for high-dimensional target data, implementations introduce thresholding procedures for the generating process to overcome issues arising from the unbounded state space of such models. This mismatch between theoretical design and implementation of diffusion models has been addressed empirically by using a \emph{reflected} diffusion process as the driver of noise instead. In this paper, we study statistical guarantees of these denoising reflected diffusion models. In particular, we establish minimax optimal rates of convergence in total variation, up to a polylogarithmic factor, under Sobolev smoothness assumptions. Our main contributions include the statistical analysis of this novel class of denoising reflected diffusion models and a refined score approximation method in both time and space, leveraging spectral decomposition and rigorous neural network analysis.</description>

      <title>E-variables for hypotheses generated by constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An e-variable for a family of distributions $\mathcal{P}$ is a nonnegative random variable whose expected value under every distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ is at most one. E-variables have recently been recognized as fundamental objects in hypothesis testing, and a rapidly growing body of work has attempted to derive admissible or optimal e-variables for various families $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we study classes $\mathcal{P}$ that are specified by constraints. Simple examples include bounds on the moments, but our general theory covers arbitrary sets of measurable constraints. Our main results characterize the set of all e-variables for such classes, as well as admissible ones. Three case studies illustrate the scope of our theory: finite constraint sets, one-sided sub-$\psi$ distributions, and distributions invariant under a group of symmetries. In particular, we generalize recent results of Clerico (2024a) by dropping all assumptions on the constraints.</description>

      <title>Estimation of discrete distributions in relative entropy, and the deviations of the missing mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-one) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk exhibits an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Efficient Influence Function for Off-Policy Evaluation Under Optimal Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) provides a powerful framework for estimating the value of a counterfactual policy using observational data, without the need for additional experimentation. Despite recent progress in robust and efficient OPE across various settings, rigorous efficiency analysis of OPE under an estimated optimal policy remains limited. In this paper, we establish a concise characterization of the efficient influence function (EIF) for the value function under optimal policy within canonical Markov decision process models. Specifically, we provide the sufficient conditions for the existence of the EIF and characterize its expression. We also give the conditions under which the EIF does not exist.</description>

      <title>Variable Selection and Minimax Prediction in High-dimensional Functional Linear Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional functional data have become increasingly prevalent in modern applications such as high-frequency financial data and neuroimaging data analysis. We investigate a class of high-dimensional linear regression models, where each predictor is a random element in an infinite-dimensional function space, and the number of functional predictors $p$ can potentially be ultra-high. Assuming that each of the unknown coefficient functions belongs to some reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we regularize the fitting of the model by imposing a group elastic-net type of penalty on the RKHS norms of the coefficient functions. We show that our loss function is Gateaux sub-differentiable, and our functional elastic-net estimator exists uniquely in the product RKHS. Under suitable sparsity assumptions and a functional version of the irrepresentable condition, we derive a non-asymptotic tail bound for variable selection consistency of our method. Allowing the number of true functional predictors $q$ to diverge with the sample size, we also show a post-selection refined estimator can achieve the oracle minimax optimal prediction rate. The proposed methods are illustrated through simulation studies and a real-data application from the Human Connectome Project.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic cellular automata with local transition matrices: synchronization, ergodicity, and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of probabilistic cellular automata that are capable of exhibiting rich dynamics such as synchronization and ergodicity and can be easily inferred from data. The system is a finite-state locally interacting Markov chain on a circular graph. Each site's subsequent state is random, with a distribution determined by its neighborhood's empirical distribution multiplied by a local transition matrix. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions on the local transition matrix for synchronization and ergodicity. Also, we introduce novel least squares estimators for inferring the local transition matrix from various types of data, which may consist of either multiple trajectories, a long trajectory, or ensemble sequences without trajectory information. Under suitable identifiability conditions, we show the asymptotic normality of these estimators and provide non-asymptotic bounds for their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Benign Overfitting in Nadaraya-Watson Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. In addition, for the purpose of tuning the hyperparameter, the results suggest that over-estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data is less harmful than under-estimating it. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.</description>

      <title>EW D-optimal Designs for Experiments with Mixed Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize EW D-optimal designs as robust designs against unknown parameter values for experiments under a general parametric model with discrete and continuous factors. When a pilot study is available, we recommend sample-based EW D-optimal designs for subsequent experiments. Otherwise, we recommend EW D-optimal designs under a prior distribution for model parameters. We propose an EW ForLion algorithm for finding EW D-optimal designs with mixed factors, and justify that the designs found by our algorithm are EW D-optimal. To facilitate potential users in practice, we also develop a rounding algorithm that converts an approximate design with mixed factors to exact designs with prespecified grid points and the number of experimental units. By applying our algorithms for real experiments under multinomial logistic models or generalized linear models, we show that our designs are highly efficient with respect to locally D-optimal designs and more robust against parameter value misspecifications.</description>

      <title>Regularized least squares learning with heavy-tailed noise is minimax optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued random variables.</description>
