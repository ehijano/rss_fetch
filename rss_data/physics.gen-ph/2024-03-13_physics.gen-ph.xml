      <title>Solving particle-antiparticle and cosmological constant problems</title>

Abstract: We argue that fundamental objects in particle theory are not elementary particles and antiparticles but objects described by irreducible representations (IRs) of the de Sitter (dS) algebra. One might ask why, then, experimental data give the impression that particles and antiparticles are fundamental and there are conserved additive quantum numbers (electric charge, baryon quantum number and others). The matter is that, at the present stage of the universe, the contraction parameter $R$ from the dS to the Poincare algebra is very large and, in the formal limit $R\to\infty$, one IR of the dS algebra splits into two IRs of the Poincare algebra corresponding to a particle and its antiparticle with the same masses. The problem why the quantities $(c,\hbar,R)$ are as are does not arise because they are contraction parameters for transitions from more general Lie algebras to less general ones. Then the baryon asymmetry of the universe problem does not arise. At the present stage of the universe, the phenomenon of cosmological acceleration (PCA) is described without uncertainties as an inevitable {\it kinematical} consequence of quantum theory in semiclassical approximation. In particular, it is not necessary to involve dark energy the physical meaning of which is a mystery. In our approach, background space and its geometry are not used and $R$ has nothing to do with the radius of dS space. In semiclassical approximation, the results for PCA are the same as in General Relativity if $\Lambda=3/R^2$, i.e., $\Lambda&gt;0$ and there is no freedom in choosing the value of $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Gravitation and Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0106051</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0106051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently some hidden inconsistencies in high energy physics and cosmology have been articulated by several scholars. If we follow the usual description we get an unacceptably high cosmological constant as was noticed by Weinberg and others some decades ago. In this paper we point out that this is because of our continued description in terms of the Planck scale. While this works for gravitation, we have to consider a phase transition from the earlier Quantum Foam to the Compton scale that describes electromagnetism, and resolves the various problems. A consequence would be that in a total vacuum there would be no gravitation.</description>
