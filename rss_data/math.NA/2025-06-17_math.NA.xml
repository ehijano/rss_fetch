      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Dual-Wind Discontinuous Galerkin Method for an Elliptic Optimal Control Problem with Control Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a symmetric dual-wind discontinuous Galerkin (DWDG) method for solving an elliptic optimal control problem with control constraints. The governing constraint is an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE), which is discretized using the symmetric DWDG approach. We derive error estimates in the energy norm for both the state and the adjoint state, as well as in the $L^2$ norm of the control variable. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the developed scheme.</description>

      <title>$\xi$-Based adaptive phase field model for quasi-static anti-plane fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\xi$-based spatially adaptive three-field variable phase-field model for quasi-static anti-plane crack propagation is introduced. A dynamically optimized regularization length is integrated to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in numerical approximations. A local adaptive mesh refinement strategy is developed, which maintains an optimal balance between mesh resolution and the accurate depiction of fractures using the \textsf{AT1} diffuse interface model. The total energy functional is comprised of three components: strain energy, surface energy, and a third term reliant on the damage zone's regularization length. The governing partial differential equations for mechanics and phase-field variables, derived from Euler-Lagrange, are discretized via the finite-element method. Two parameters functioning as penalty variables are incorporated; both are asymptotically estimated from the gradient of the phase-field variable. By these estimated parameters, mesh adaptivity is enhanced, ensuring the convergence of the numerical solution. Standard phase-field methods are shown by numerical results to be surpassed by the adaptive model; an accurate representation of fractures is provided, and computational costs are significantly lowered. By employing the proposed spatially adaptive approach, a vastly larger regularization length parameter is achieved compared to other methods throughout the entire computation.</description>

      <title>A new Lagrange multiplier approach for constructing structure preserving schemes, III. Bound preserving and energy dissipating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the third part of this series, we continue to explore the idea of the Lagrange multiplier introduced in the first part [2020, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engr., 391, 114585] and refined in the second part [2022, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 60, 970-998] to further develop efficient and accurate numerical schemes that preserve the maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy dissipation for solving gradient flows. The proposed framework allows us to begin with any conventional scheme as a predictor step which is followed by two consecutive correction steps written in the form of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for structure preserving. The preservation of both energy dissipation and MBP and the solvability of the general resulting scheme are rigorously established. In such a framework, we implement an explicit and efficient scheme by employing the Runge-Kutta exponential time differencing scheme as the predictor step, and give its convergence analysis. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Superconvergent quadriatic finite element on uniform tetrahedral meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a direct computation, we show that the $P_2$ interpolation of a $P_3$ function is also a local $H^1$-projection on uniform tetrahedral meshes, i.e., the difference is $H^1$-orthogonal to the $P_2$ Lagrange basis function on the support patch of tetrahedra of the basis function. Consequently, we show the $H^1$ and $L^2$ rconvergence of the $P_2$ Lagrange finite element on uniform tetrahedral meshes. Using the standard 20-points Lagrange $P_3$ interpolation, where the 20 nodes are exactly some $P_2$ global basis nodes, we lift the superconvergent $P_2$ finite element solution to a quasi-optimal $P_3$ solution on each cube. Numerical results confirm the theory.</description>

      <title>An optimal two-side Robin-Robin domain decomposition method for H(div)-elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new two-side Robin-Robin domain decomposition method for H(div)-elliptic problem. Numerical results show that the convergence rate of the new algorithm only depends on $H/h$, where $H$ is diameter of subdomains and $h$ is the mesh size. Besides, an algebraic system of Robin boundary conditions is derived from the iterative method. We solve it by MINRES and get asymptotically stable iteration numbers as well.</description>

      <title>The convergence proof of the sixth-order compact 9-point FDM for the 2D transport problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the convergence proof of the error in the $l_{\infty}$ norm of the high-order finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM) in 2D is challenging. In this paper, we derive the sixth-order compact 9-point FDM with the explicit stencil for the 2D transport problem with the constant coefficient and the Dirichlet boundary condition in a unit square. The proposed sixth-order FDM forms an M-matrix for the any mesh size $h$ employing the uniform Cartesian mesh. The explicit formula of our FDM also enables us to construct the comparison function with the explicit expression to rigorously prove the sixth-order convergence rate of the maximum pointwise error by the discrete maximum principle. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the sixth-order convergence proof is valid for any mesh size $h$. The numerical results are consistent with sixth-order accuracy in the $l_{\infty}$ norm. Our theoretical convergence proof is clear and the proposed sixth-order FDM is straightforward to be implemented, facilitating the reproduction of our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Computing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes excitations of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient and spectrally accurate numerical method to compute elementary/collective excitations in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), around their mean-field ground state, by solving the associated Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation. The BdG equation is essentially an eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian differential operator with an eigenfunction normalization constraint. Firstly, we investigate its analytical properties, including the exact eigenpairs, generalized nullspace structure and bi-orthogonality of eigenspaces. Subsequently, by combining the Fourier spectral method for spatial discretization and a stable modified Gram-Schmidt bi-orthogonal algorithm, we propose a structure-preserving iterative method for the resulting large-scale dense non-Hermitian discrete eigenvalue problem. Our method is matrix-free, and the matrix-vector multiplication (or the operator-function evaluation) is implemented with a near-optimal complexity ${\mathcal O}(N_{\rm t}\log(N_{\rm t}))$, where $N_{\rm t}$ is the total number of grid points, thanks to the utilization of the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Therefore, it is memory-friendly, spectrally accurate, and highly efficient. Finally, we carry out a comprehensive numerical investigation to showcase its superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency, alongside some applications to compute the excitation spectrum and Bogoliubov amplitudes in one, two, and three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Avoiding FFT-Based Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) libraries are widely used for evaluating discrete convolutions. Most FFT implementations follow some variant of the Cooley-Tukey framework, in which the transform is decomposed into butterfly operations and index-reversal permutations. While butterfly operations dominate the floating-point operation count, the memory access patterns induced by index-reversal permutations significantly degrade the FFT's arithmetic intensity. In practice, discrete convolutions are often applied repeatedly with a fixed filter. In such cases, we show that the index-reversal permutations involved in both the forward and backward transforms of standard FFT-based convolution implementations can be avoided by deferring to a single offline permutation of the filter. We propose a multi-dimensional, permutation-avoiding convolution procedure within a general radix Cooley-Tukey framework. We perform numerical experiments to benchmark our algorithms against state-of-the-art FFT-based convolution implementations. Our results suggest that developers of FFT libraries should consider supporting permutation-avoiding convolution kernels.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Multigrid Preconditioner for Discontinuous Galerkin Shifted Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric multigrid preconditioner for the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) designed to solve PDEs on complex geometries. While SBM simplifies mesh generation by using a non-conforming background grid, it often results in non-symmetric and potentially ill-conditioned linear systems that are challenging to solve efficiently. Standard multigrid methods with pointwise smoothers prove ineffective for such systems due to the localized perturbations introduced by the shifted boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation for SBM that enables the design of a cell-wise multiplicative smoother within an $hp$-multigrid framework. The element-local nature of DG methods naturally facilitates cell-wise correction, which can effectively handle the local complexities arising from the boundary treatment. Numerical results for the Poisson equation demonstrate favorable performance with mesh refinement for linear ($p=1$) and quadratic ($p=2$) elements in both 2D and 3D, with iteration counts showing mild growth. However, challenges emerge for cubic ($p=3$) elements, particularly in 3D, where the current smoother shows reduced effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Pointwise-in-time error bounds for semilinear and quasilinear fractional subdiffusion equations on graded meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-fractional semilinear and quasilinear parabolic equations with a Caputo time derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ are considered, solutions of which exhibit a singular behaviour at an initial time of type $t^\sigma$ for any fixed $\sigma \in (0,1) \cup (1,2)$. The L1 scheme in time is combined with a general class of discretizations for the semilinear term. For such discretizations, we obtain sharp pointwise-in-time error bounds on graded temporal meshes with arbitrary degree of grading. Both semi-discretizations in time and full discretizations using finite differences and finite elements in space are addressed. The theoretcal findings are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Recovery of initial displacement and velocity in anisotropic elastic systems by the time dimensional reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a time-dimensional reduction method for the inverse source problem in linear elasticity, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial displacement and velocity fields from partial boundary measurements of elastic wave propagation. The key idea is to employ a novel spectral representation in time, using an orthonormal basis composed of Legendre polynomials weighted by exponential functions. This Legendre polynomial-exponential basis enables a stable and accurate decomposition in the time variable, effectively reducing the original space-time inverse problem to a sequence of coupled spatial elasticity systems that no longer depend on time. These resulting systems are solved using the quasi-reversibility method. On the theoretical side, we establish a convergence theorem ensuring the stability and consistency of the regularized solution obtained by the quasi-reversibility method as the noise level tends to zero. On the computational side, two-dimensional numerical experiments confirm the theory and demonstrate the method's ability to accurately reconstruct both the geometry and amplitude of the initial data, even in the presence of substantial measurement noise. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework as a robust and computationally efficient strategy for inverse elastic source problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops stable finite element pairs for the linear stress gradient elasticity model, overcoming classical elasticity's limitations in capturing size effects. We analyze mesh conditions to establish parameter-robust error estimates for the proposed pairs, achieving unconditional stability for finite elements with higher vertex continuity and conditional stability for Continuous Galerkin-Discontinuous Galerkin (CG-DG) pairs when no interior vertex has edges lying on three or fewer lines. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrating optimal convergence rates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order linear positivity preserving schemes in time are available for the time dependent Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, second-order linear ones are still challenging. This paper proposes the first- and second-order exponential time differencing schemes with the finite difference spatial discretization for PNP equations, based on the $Slotboom$ transformation of the Nernst-Planck equations and linear stabilization technique. The proposed schemes are linear and preserve the mass conservation and positivity preservation of ion concentration at full discrete level without any constraints on the time step size. The corresponding energy stability analysis is also presented, demonstrating that the second-order scheme can dissipate the modified energy. Extensive numerical results are carried out to support the theoretical findings and showcase the performance of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Quadrature Method for Implicitly Defined Hypersurfaces and Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-order accurate numerical quadrature algorithm for evaluating integrals over curved surfaces and regions defined implicitly via a level set of a given function restricted to a hyperrectangle. The domain is divided into small tetrahedrons, and by employing the change of variables formula, the approach yields an algorithm requiring only one-dimensional root finding and standard Gaussian quadrature. The resulting quadrature scheme guarantees strictly positive weights and inherits the high-order accuracy of Gaussian quadrature. Numerical convergence tests confirm the method's high-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal ${L^2}$ error estimates for 2D/3D incompressible Cahn--Hilliard--magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an optimal error analysis of a fully discrete finite element scheme for the Cahn--Hilliard--magnetohydrodynamic (CH-MHD) system. The method use the standard inf-sup stable Taylor--Hood/MINI elements to solve the Navier--Stokes equations, Lagrange elements to solve the phase field, and particularly, the N\'ed\'elec elements for solving the magnetic induction field. Suffering from the strong coupling and high nonlinearity, the previous works just provide suboptimal error estimates for phase field and velocity field in $L^{2}/\L^2$-norm under the same order elements, and the suboptimal error estimates for magnetic induction field in $\H(\rm curl)$-norm. To this end, we utilize the Ritz, Stokes, and Maxwell quasi-projections to eliminate the low-order pollution of the phase field and magnetic induction field. In addition to the optimal $\L^2$-norm error estimates, we present the optimal convergence rates for magnetic induction field in $\H(\rm curl)$-norm and for velocity field in $\H^1$-norm. Moreover, the unconditional energy stability and mass conservation of the proposed scheme are preserved. Numerical examples are illustrated to validate the theoretical analysis and show the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Faithful-Newton Framework: Bridging Inner and Outer Solvers for Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Newton-type methods are known for their fast local convergence and strong empirical performance, achieving theoretically favorable global convergence compared to first-order methods remains a key challenge. For instance, surprisingly, for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward variant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent. Although sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity over gradient descent for various problems, they often involve highly nontrivial subproblems that incur significantly higher per-iteration costs, resulting in a much worse overall operation complexity. These limitations arise from treating the subproblem as an afterthought, either by handling it as a black box, thus permitting complex, highly nontrivial, and nearly unimplementable formulations, or by evaluating subproblem solutions in isolation, without considering their effectiveness in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By tightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem solver and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce simple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton methods, which, in a sense, remain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by retaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference, however, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed based on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables desirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard assumptions, we show that our variants match the worst-case complexity of gradient descent in strongly convex settings, both in iteration and operation complexity, and achieve competitive iteration complexity for general convex problems.</description>

      <title>Conditional a priori error estimates of finite volume and Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods with abstract limiting for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive conditional a priori error estimates of a wide class of finite volume and Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods with abstract limiting for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in 1D via the verification of weak consistency and entropy stability, as recently proposed by Bressan et al.~\cite{BressanChiriShen21}. Convergence in $L^\infty L^1$ with rate $h^{1/3}$ is obtained under a time step restriction $\tau\leq ch$, provided the following conditions hold: the exact solution is piecewise Lipschitz continuous, its (finitely many and isolated) shock curves can be traced with precision $h^{2/3}$ and, outside of these shock tracing tubular neighborhoods the numerical solution -- assumed to be uniformly small in BV -- has oscillation strength $h$ across each mesh cell and cell boundary.</description>

      <title>A High-Order, Pressure-Robust, and Decoupled Finite Difference Method for the Stokes Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Stokes problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions and the constant kinematic viscosity $\nu$ in an axis-aligned domain $\Omega$. We decouple the velocity $\bm u$ and pressure $p$ by deriving a novel biharmonic equation in $\Omega$ and third-order boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$. In contrast to the fourth-order streamfunction approach, our formulation does not require $\Omega$ to be simply connected. For smooth velocity fields $\bm u$ in two dimensions, we explicitly construct a finite difference method (FDM) with sixth-order consistency to approximate $\bm u$ at all relevant grid points: interior points, boundary side points, and boundary corner points. The resulting scheme yields two linear systems $A_1u^{(1)}_h=b_1$ and $A_2u^{(2)}_h=b_2$, where $A_1,A_2$ are constant matrices, and $b_1,b_2$ are independent of the pressure $p$ and the kinematic viscosity $\nu$. Thus, the proposed method is pressure- and viscosity-robust. To accommodate velocity fields with less regularity, we modify the FDM by removing singular terms in the right-hand side vectors. Once the discrete velocity is computed, we apply a sixth-order finite difference operator to approximate the pressure gradient locally, without solving any additional linear systems. In our numerical experiments, we test both smooth and non-smooth solutions $(\bm u,p)$ in a square domain, a triply connected domain, and an $L$-shaped domain in two dimensions. The results confirm sixth-order convergence of the velocity and pressure gradient in the $\ell_\infty$-norm for smooth solutions. For non-smooth velocity fields, our method achieves the expected lower-order convergence. Moreover, the observed velocity error $\|{\bm u}_h-\bm u\|_{\infty}$ is independent of the pressure $p$ and viscosity $\nu$.</description>

      <title>A hybrid isogeometric and finite element method: NURBS-enhanced finite element method for hexahedral meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a NURBS-enhanced finite element method that integrates NURBS-based boundary representations of geometric domains into standard finite element frameworks applied to hexahedral meshes. We decompose an open, bounded, convex three-dimensional domain with a NURBS boundary into two parts, define the NURBS-enhanced finite elements over the boundary layer, and use piecewise-linear Lagrange finite elements in the interior region. We introduce a novel quadrature rule and a novel interpolation operator for the NURBS-enhanced elements. We derive the stability and approximation properties of the interpolation operators that we use. We describe how the h-refinement in finite element analysis and the knot insertion in isogeometric analysis can be utilized in the refinement of the NURBS-enhanced elements. To illustrate an application of our methodology, we utilize a generic weak formulation of a second-order elliptic PDE and derive a priori error estimates in the $H^{1}$ norm. The proposed methodology combines the efficiency of finite element analysis with the geometric precision of NURBS, and may enable more accurate and efficient simulations over complex geometries.</description>

      <title>PDEfuncta: Spectrally-Aware Neural Representation for PDE Solution Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions, fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling, capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver. We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets, confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.</description>

      <title>Dual guidance: ROM-informed field reconstruction with generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dual-guided framework for reconstructing unsteady incompressible flow fields using sparse observations. The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</description>

      <title>TensorSLM: Energy-efficient Embedding Compression of Sub-billion Parameter Language Models on Low-end Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Variational Coercivity, Perturbation Bounds, and Concentration Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions. Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust training.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Adjoint-Optimized Neural PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the AMLI-cycle method and make two contributions. First, we revisit the AMLI-cycle using the Chebyshev polynomials and establish a theory for its uniform convergence, assuming the two-grid method converges uniformly. This removes the need for estimating extreme eigenvalues at all coarse levels. Only an estimation of the two-grid convergence rate is needed, which could be done on the second coarsest level, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs for large-scale problems. Second, we introduce a momentum-accelerated AMLI-cycle using polynomials from momentum accelerations. This novel approach ensures a uniform condition number without requiring extreme eigenvalue or two-grid convergence rate estimations, making its implementation as straightforward as standard multigrid methods. We prove that it is asymptotically as good as the AMLI-cycle using the Chebyshev polynomials when the quadratic momentum-accelerated polynomials is used. Numerical experiments confirm the robustness and efficiency of the momentum-accelerated AMLI-cycle across various problems, demonstrating performance comparable to the Chebyshev-based AMLI-cycle. These findings validate the theoretical advantages and practical efficacy of the momentum-accelerated AMLI-cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of kinetic problems can become prohibitively expensive due to their large memory requirements and computational costs. A method that has proven to successfully reduce these costs is the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). A major accomplishment in the field of DLRA has been the derivation of robust time integrators that are not limited by the stiffness of the DLRA evolution equations. One key question is whether such robust time integrators can be made locally conservative, i.e., can they preserve the invariants and associated conservation laws of the original problem? In this work, we propose extensions to commonly used basis-update \&amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators that preserve invariants of the solution as well as the associated conservation laws with little or no additional computational cost. This approach requires only minor modifications of existing implementations. The properties of these integrators are investigated by performing numerical simulations in radiation transport and plasma physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new space-time variational formulation for wave equation initial-boundary value problems. The key property is that the formulation is coercive (sign-definite) and continuous in a norm stronger than $H^1(Q)$, $Q$ being the space-time cylinder. Coercivity holds for constant-coefficient impedance cavity problems posed in star-shaped domains, and for a class of impedance-Dirichlet problems. The formulation is defined using simple Morawetz multipliers and its coercivity is proved with elementary analytical tools, following earlier work on the Helmholtz equation. The formulation can be stably discretised with any $H^2(Q)$-conforming discrete space, leading to quasi-optimal space-time Galerkin schemes. Several numerical experiments show the excellent properties of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of distribution shift generally arising in machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation, where parts of simulation algorithms are replaced by data-driven surrogates. We first establish a mathematical framework to understand the structure of machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation problems, and the cause and effect of the associated distribution shift. We show correlations between distribution shift and simulation error both numerically and theoretically. Then, we propose a simple methodology based on tangent-space regularized estimator to control the distribution shift, thereby improving the long-term accuracy of the simulation results. In the linear dynamics case, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we conduct several numerical experiments, including simulating a partially known reaction-diffusion equation and solving Navier-Stokes equations using the projection method with a data-driven pressure solver. In all cases, we observe marked improvements in simulation accuracy under the proposed method, especially for systems with high degrees of distribution shift, such as those with relatively strong non-linear reaction mechanisms, or flows at large Reynolds numbers.</description>

Abstract: We propose a parareal based time parallelization scheme in the phase-space for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. We use PIF with a coarse tolerance for the nonuniform fast Fourier transforms, or the standard particle-in-cell scheme, combined with temporal coarsening, as coarse propagators. This is different from the typical spatial coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes for parareal, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. We perform an error analysis of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the parareal algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>

      <title>On the backward stability of s-step GMRES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication, i.e., data movement, is a critical bottleneck for the performance of classical Krylov subspace method solvers on modern computer architectures. Variants of these methods which avoid communication have been introduced, which, while equivalent in exact arithmetic, can be unstable in finite precision. In this work, we address the backward stability of $s$-step GMRES, also known as communication-avoiding GMRES. Compared to the ``modular framework'' proposed in [A.~Buttari, N.~J.~Higham, T.~Mary, \&amp; B.~Vieubl\'e. Preprint in 2024.], we present an improved framework for simplifying the analysis of $s$-step GMRES, which includes standard GMRES ($s=1$) as a special case, by isolating the effects of rounding errors in the QR factorization and the solution of the least squares problem. The key advantage of this new framework is that it is evident how the orthogonalization method affects the backward error, and it is not necessary to re-evaluate anything other than the orthogonalization itself when modifying the orthogonalization used in GMRES. Using this framework, we analyze $s$-step GMRES with popular block orthogonalization methods: block modified Gram--Schmidt and reorthogonalized block classical Gram--Schmidt algorithms.
  An example illustrates the resulting instability of $s$-step GMRES when paired with the classical $s$-step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified $s$-step Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size $s$ while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Riemannian conjugate Sobolev gradients and their application to compute ground states of BECs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the numerical computation of ground states of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) which can exhibit a multiscale lattice of quantized vortices. This problem involves the minimization of an energy functional on a Riemannian manifold. For this we apply the framework of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of Sobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous work that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients methods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy. In this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special attention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search direction and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As known from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum parameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor. Besides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the methods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a standard $H^1_0$-metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the numerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed adaptive metric along with a Polak-Ribi\'ere or Hestenes-Stiefel-type momentum parameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the other CG methods that were part of our numerical study.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed finite element methods for linear Cosserat elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two parameter-robust mixed finite element methods for linear Cosserat elasticity. The Cosserat coupling constant $\mu_c$, connecting the displacement $u$ and rotation vector $\omega$, leads to possible locking phenomena in finite element methods. The formal limit of $\mu_c\to\infty$ enforces the constraint $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{curl} u = \omega$ and leads to the fourth-order couple stress problem. Viewing the linear Cosserat model as the Hodge-Laplacian problem of a twisted de~Rham complex, we derive structure-preserving distributional finite element spaces, where the limit constraint is fulfilled in the discrete setting. Applying the mass conserving mixed stress (MCS) method for the rotations, the resulting scheme is robust in $\mu_c$. Combining it with the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress (TDNNS) method for the displacement part, we obtain additional robustness in the nearly incompressible regime and for anisotropic structures. Using a post-processing scheme for the rotations, we prove optimal convergence rates independent of the Cosserat coupling constant $\mu_c$. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in several numerical benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Bound preserving Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) scheme: one-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a bound-preserving (BP) Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) scheme by blending third-order and first-order constructions. The originality of the present construction is that it does not need any explicit reconstruction within each element, and therefore the construction is very flexible. The scheme employs a classical blending approach between a first-order BP scheme and a high-order scheme that does not inherently preserve bounds. The proposed BP PAMPA scheme demonstrates effectiveness across a range of problems, from scalar cases to systems such as the Euler equations of gas dynamics. We derive optimal blending parameters for both scalar and system cases, with the latter based on the recent geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) framework of [Wu \&amp; Shu, {\em SIAM Review}, 65 (2023), pp. 1031--1073]. This yields explicit, optimal blending coefficients that ensure positivity and control spurious oscillations in both point values and cell averages. This framework incorporates a convex blending of fluxes and residuals from both high-order and first-order updates, facilitating a rigorous BP property analysis. Sufficient conditions for the BP property are established, ensuring robustness while preserving high-order accuracy. Numerical tests confirm the effectiveness of the BP PAMPA scheme on several challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Multilevel randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested integration problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications, including Bayesian experimental design, financial risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. These nested integrals take the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, for nonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering complexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel estimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to handle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner number of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand evaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant reductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed estimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is evaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without compromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical experiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of experiments. When applied to Gaussian noise in the experiment, a truncation scheme ensures finite error bounds at the same computational complexity as in the bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results reveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and rQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and offering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested integration problems across various domains.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Neural Operator for Parametric PDEs on Complex and Variable Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models are critical for accelerating computationally expensive simulations in science and engineering, particularly for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Developing practical surrogate models poses significant challenges, particularly in handling geometrically complex and variable domains, which are often discretized as point clouds. In this work, we systematically investigate the formulation of neural operators -- maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces -- on point clouds to better handle complex and variable geometries while mitigating discretization effects. We introduce the Point Cloud Neural Operator (PCNO), designed to efficiently approximate solution maps of parametric PDEs on such domains. We evaluate the performance of PCNO on a range of pedagogical PDE problems, focusing on aspects such as boundary layers, adaptively meshed point clouds, and variable domains with topological variations. Its practicality is further demonstrated through three-dimensional applications, such as predicting pressure loads on various vehicle types and simulating the inflation process of intricate parachute structures.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Stochastic Block Projection Algorithm for Solving Linear Systems under Predefined Communication Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an event-triggered asynchronous distributed randomized block Kaczmarz projection (ER-AD-RBKP) algorithm for efficiently solving large-scale linear systems in resource-constrained and communication-unstable environments. The algorithm enables each agent to update its local state estimate independently and engage in communication only when specific triggering conditions are satisfied, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead. At each iteration, agents perform projections using randomly selected partial local data blocks to lower per-iteration computational costs and enhance scalability. By defining events that ensure strong connectivity in the communication graph, we derive the sufficient conditions for global convergence under a probabilistic framework, proving that the algorithm converges exponentially in expectation as long as no extreme events (e.g., permanent agent disconnection) occur. Besides, for inconsistent systems, auxiliary variables are incorporated to transform the problem into an equivalent consistent formulation, and theoretical error bounds are derived. Moreover, we implement the ER-AD-RBKP algorithm in an asynchronous communication environment built on ROS2, a distributed middleware framework for real-time robotic systems. We evaluate the algorithm under various settings, including varying numbers of agents, neighborhood sizes, communication intervals, and failure scenarios such as communication disruptions and processing faults. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of computational efficiency, communication cost, and system resilience, highlighting its strong potential for practical applicability in real-world distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Partial Condition Numbers for Double Saddle Point Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for investigating the partial condition number (CN) of the solution of double saddle point problems (DSPPs) and provides closed-form expressions for it. This unified framework encompasses the well-known partial normwise CN (NCN), partial mixed CN (MCN) and partial componentwise CN (CCN) as special cases. Furthermore, we derive sharp upper bounds for the partial NCN, MCN and CCN, which are computationally efficient and free of expensive Kronecker products. By applying perturbations that preserve the structure of the block matrices of the DSPPs, we analyze the structured partial NCN, MCN and CCN when the block matrices exhibit linear structures. By leveraging the relationship between DSPP and equality constrained indefinite least squares (EILS) problems, we recover the partial CNs for the EILS problem. Numerical results confirm the sharpness of the derived upper bounds and demonstrate their effectiveness in estimating the partial CNs.</description>

      <title>The Fast Newton Transform: Interpolation in Downward Closed Polynomial Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Fast Newton Transform (FNT), an algorithm for performing $m$-variate Newton interpolation in downward closed polynomial spaces with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(|A|m\overline{n})$. Here, $A$ is a downward closed set of cardinality $|A|$ equal to the dimension of the associated downward closed polynomial space $\Pi_A$, where $\overline{n}$ denotes the mean of the maximum polynomial degrees across the spatial dimensions $m$. For functions being analytic in an open Bernstein poly-ellipse, geometric approximation rates apply when interpolating in non-tensorial Leja-ordered Chebyshev-Lobatto or Leja grids. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we utilize $\ell^p$-sets, with the $l^2$-Euclidean case turning out to be the pivotal choice, leading to $|A|/(n+1)^m \in \mathcal{O}(e^{-m})$. Expanding non-periodic functions, the FNT complements the approximation capabilities of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Choosing $\ell^2$-sets for $A$ renders the FNT time complexity to be less than the FFT time complexity $\mathcal{O}((n+1)^m m \log(n))$ in a range of $n$, behaving as $\mathcal{O}(e^m)$. Maintaining this advantage true for the differentials, the FNT sets a new standard in $m$-variate interpolation and approximation practice.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling, typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann distributions and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed statistical finite element (statFEM) approach synthesises measurement data with finite element models and allows for making predictions about the unknown true system response. We provide a probabilistic error analysis for a prototypical statFEM setup based on a Gaussian process prior under the assumption that the noisy measurement data are generated by a deterministic true system response function that satisfies a second-order elliptic partial differential equation for an unknown true source term. In certain cases, properties such as the smoothness of the source term may be misspecified by the Gaussian process model. The error estimates we derive are for the expectation with respect to the measurement noise of the $L^2$-norm of the difference between the true system response and the mean of the statFEM posterior. The estimates imply polynomial rates of convergence in the numbers of measurement points and finite element basis functions and depend on the Sobolev smoothness of the true source term and the Gaussian process model. A numerical example for Poisson's equation is used to illustrate these theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Efficient Numerical Integration in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces via Leverage Scores Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m&lt;n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the universal approximation properties of transformers and neural integral operators for operators in Banach spaces. In particular, we show that the transformer architecture is a universal approximator of integral operators between H\"older spaces. Moreover, we show that a generalized version of neural integral operators, based on the Gavurin integral, are universal approximators of arbitrary operators between Banach spaces. Lastly, we show that a modified version of transformer, which uses Leray-Schauder mappings, is a universal approximator of operators between arbitrary Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Tight Convergence Rates in Gradient Mapping for the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new theoretical convergence guarantees for the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), where the second function is allowed to be weakly-convex, measuring progress via composite gradient mapping. Based on a tight analysis of two iterations of DCA, we identify six parameter regimes leading to sublinear convergence rates toward critical points and establish those rates by proving adapted descent lemmas. We recover existing rates for the standard difference-of-convex decompositions of nonconvex-nonconcave functions, while for all other curvature settings our results are new, complementing recently obtained rates on the gradient residual. Three of our sublinear rates are tight for any number of DCA iterations, while for the other three regimes we conjecture exact rates, using insights from the tight analysis of gradient descent and numerical validation using the performance estimation methodology. Finally, we show how the equivalence between proximal gradient descent (PGD) and DCA allows the derivation of exact PGD rates for any constant stepsize.</description>

      <title>TL;DR: Too Long, Do Re-weighting for Efficient LLM Reasoning Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.</description>

      <title>A thorough study of Riemannian Newton's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a thorough numerical study of Riemannian Newton's Method (RNM) for optimization problems, with a focus on the Grassmannian and on the Stiefel manifold. We compare the Riemannian formulation of Newton's Method with its classical Euclidean counterpart based on Lagrange multipliers by applying both approaches to the important and challenging Hartree--Fock energy minimization problem from Quantum Chemistry. Experiments on a dataset of 125 molecules show that the Riemannian approaches achieve higher convergence rates, require fewer iterations, and exhibit greater robustness to the choice of initial guess. In this work we also analyze the numerical issues that arise from using Newton's Method on the total manifold when the cost function is defined on the quotient manifold. We investigate the performance of a modified RNM in which we ignore the small eigenvalues of the Hessian and the results indicate that this modified method is stable and performs on par with the RNM on the quotient manifold.</description>
