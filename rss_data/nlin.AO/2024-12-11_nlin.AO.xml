      <title>Promoting Cooperation in the Public Goods Game using Artificial Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as facilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory Cooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where players evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents Mimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.</description>

      <title>The impact of nonlocal coupling on deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation in an ensemble of bistable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on methods of numerical simulation, the constructive role of nonlocal coupling is demonstrated in the context of wavefront propagation observed in an ensemble of overdamped bistable oscillators. Firstly, it is shown that the wavefront propagation can be controlled, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, by varying the strength and radius of nonlocal interactions. This applies to both deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation. Secondly, nonlocal interactions are found to facilitate preservation of spatial domains and fronts being totally destroyed due to the action of noise in the case of local coupling. In addition, a new finding concerning the action of additive noise is reported: it is shown that additive noise is capable of accelerating front propagation if the local dynamics involves asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Collective rhythm design in coupled mixed-feedback systems through dominance and bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of mixed-feedback systems provides an effective framework for the design of robust and tunable oscillations in nonlinear systems characterized by interleaved fast positive and slow negative feedback loops. The goal of this paper is to extend the mixed-feedback oscillation design framework to networks. To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed-feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.</description>
