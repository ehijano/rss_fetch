      <title>Follow-up on three poorly studied AM CVn stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report follow-up observations of three poorly studied AM CVn-type binaries: CRTS CSS150211 J091017-200813, NSV1440, and SDSSJ183131.63+420220.2. Analysing time-series photometry obtained with a range of ground-based facilities as well as with TESS, we determine the superhump period of CRTSJ0910-2008 as P_sh=29.700+-0.004min and the orbital period of NSV1440 as Porb=36.56+-0.03min. We also confirm a photometric period of P=23.026+-0.097min in SDSSJ1831+4202, which is most likely the superhump period. We also report the first optical spectroscopy of CRTSJ0910-2008 and NSV1440 which unambiguously confirms both as AM CVn systems. We briefly discuss the distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the currently known sample of 63 AM CVn stars with known periods and Gaia data.</description>

      <title>Gaia-ESO Survey: massive stars in the Carina Nebula. II. The spectroscopic analysis of the O-star population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new census of massive stars in the Carina nebula reveals the presence of 54 apparently single O-type stars in the Car OB1 association, an extremely active star-forming region which hosts some of the most luminous stars of the Milky Way. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the currently most complete sample of O-type stars in the association can be used to inspect the main physical properties of cluster members and test evolutionary and stellar atmospheres models. We perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis for the most complete sample of apparently single O-type stars in Car OB1 with available spectroscopic data. From the high-resolution GES and OWN spectra we obtain a reliable distribution of rotational velocities for a sample of 37 O-type stars. It shows a bimodal structure with a low velocity peak at 60 km s$^{-1}$ and a short tail of fast rotators reaching 320 km s$^{-1}$. We also perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis and derive effective temperature, surface gravity and He abundance for a sample of 47 O-type stars, now including further stars from GOSSS database. Radii, luminosities, and spectroscopic masses were also determined using $Gaia$ astrometry. We create the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to inspect the evolutionary status of the region and confirm the lack of stars close to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) between $\sim$35 -- 55 M$_\odot$. We confirm a very young population with an age distribution peaking at 1 Myr, some stars close or even on the ZAMS, and a secondary peak at 4 -- 5 Myr in the age distribution. We confirm the youth of Trumpler 14, which is also the only cluster not showing the secondary peak. We also find a clear trend to evolutionary masses higher than derived spectroscopic masses for stars with evolutionary mass below 40 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS 12-band photometry as a powerful tool for discovery and classification: ten cataclysmic variables in a proof-of-concept study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-band photometric surveys provide a straightforward way to discover and classify astrophysical objects systematically, enabling the study of a large number of targets at relatively low cost. Here we introduce an alternative approach to select Accreting White Dwarf (AWD) candidates following their spectral energy distribution, entirely supported by the twelve photometric bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). The method was validated with optical spectroscopic follow-up with the Gemini South telescope which unambiguously established ten systems as cataclysmic variables (CVs), alongside Swift X-ray observations of four of them. Among the ten CVs presented here are those that may be low-luminosity intermediate polars or WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with rare outbursts, two subclasses that can be easily missed in time-domain and X-ray surveys, the two methods currently dominating the discovery of new CVs. Our approach based on S-PLUS provides an important, complementary tool to uncover the total population of CVs and the complete set of its subclasses, which is an important step towards a full understanding of close binary evolution, including the origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs and the physics of accretion. Finally, we highlight the potential of S-PLUS beyond AWDs, serving other surveys in the characterization of their sources.</description>

      <title>Three Brown Dwarfs Masquerading as High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic identification of three brown dwarf candidates -- o005_s41280, o006_s00089, and o006_s35616 -- discovered in the RUBIES using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) PRISM/CLEAR spectroscopy. We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity, and other derived properties. The results suggest that o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ in the ranges of 2100--2300 K and 1800--2000 K, are likely L dwarfs, while o006_s00089, with $T_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1000$ K, is consistent with a late T dwarf classification. The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the $Y$, $J$, and $H$ bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color-color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006_s00089, overlap with little red dots (LRDs), while hotter L dwarfs, like o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, tend to contaminate the high-redshift galaxy cluster. These findings suggest a brown dwarf contamination rate of approximately 0.1% in extragalactic deep field surveys, with L dwarfs being more frequently detected than cooler T and Y dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Flaring Activities of Fast Rotating Stars have Solar-like Latitudinal Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamo theory has always been one of the biggest mysteries in stellar physics. One key reason for its uncertainty is poor knowledge of the dynamo process on stars except the Sun. The most important observation feature of solar dynamo is that active regions only appear at low latitudes, which provides a crucial constraint to the dynamo theory, while Doppler imaging, the current technique to spatially resolve stellar hemisphere, is difficult to distinguish the equatorial region . Hence, the latitudinal distribution of active regions (LDAR) of stars is ambiguous and controversial, mainly due to the limit of the current technique for spatially resolving the stellar surface. Fast rotating stars, which are young and active, are thought to operate with a different dynamo process than the Sun. We study their LDAR and compare them with the Sun to reveal the underlying dynamo process. Flares are drastic and observational activity events, which occur in active regions. Here, we propose a new method to study how the apparent flaring activity varies with respect to the inclination to determine the LDAR of fast rotating stars.We find that the LDAR of fast rotating stars is consistent with that of the Sun, contrary to expectations. Our results provide a crucial constraint to stellar dynamo, indicating that the solar-like dynamo also applies to fast rotating stars, even spanning different stages of their evolution.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR detection of a hot stellar superflare with a temperature of 95 MK in hard X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search of the hard X-ray archive data of NuSTAR found a transient source, NuSTAR J230059+5857.4, during an observation of 1E 2259+586 on 2013 April 25. A multi-wavelength analysis using X-ray, optical, and IR data, mostly taken in its quiescent phase, was conducted to identify the origin of NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 and elucidate the phenomena associated with the flare activity. The results indicated that NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 was a stellar flare that occurred on a single M-dwarf, M-dwarf binary, or pre-main-sequence star. NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 exhibited the higher emission measure and higher temperature, 8.60+2.15/-1.73x10^54 cm^-3 and 8.21+2.71/-1.86 keV, respectively, on average than the nominal values of stellar flares reported in the past. The flare loop size estimated on the basis of the model to balance the plasma and magnetic pressures was larger than the stellar radius by a factor of several. Since based on solar flare loops, this flare loop scale is excessively large, we conjecture that the observed large emission measure is possible to be attributed to the observation of mutually-associated multiple flares simultaneously occurring on the stellar surface, known as sympathetic flares. Thanks to the large effective area of NuSTAR in the hard X-ray band, we can conduct detailed discussion about a temperature variation associated with the flare. Investigation of the temperature variation during the flare revealed that the temperature remained significantly higher than during the quiescent phase even after the count rate dropped to around 5% of the peak. The sustained high temperature over the long duration is consistent with the idea of sympathetic flares. We found that it is essential to use theoretical models to evaluate loops and assess temporal changes in temperature as done in this study to determine whether there are multiple flares or not when analyzing flare observation data.</description>

      <title>Assessing the validity of the anelastic and Boussinesq approximations to model solar inertial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global-scale inertial modes of oscillations have been recently observed on the Sun. They might play an important dynamic and diagnostic role for the Sun. This work aims to assess the validity of simplifying assumptions in the equation of continuity, which have often been used in the linear models of solar inertial modes. We compute the linear eigenmodes of the Sun's convection zone in the inertial frequency range using the Dedalus code. This single framework enables us to compare the sensitivity of the modes to different model setups, such as the compressible setup and the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations. We consider both the cases of uniform rotation and solar differential rotation (as given by helioseismology). We find that the compressible and anelastic models have almost identical eigenmodes under uniform rotation and solar differential rotation. On the other hand, the absence of density stratification in the Boussinesq model results in significantly different eigenmodes under these setups. The differences are most prominent for the non-toroidal modes with significant radial motions mainly due to the absence of the compressional $\beta$-effect. The anelastic approximation simplifies the calculations and reduces the numerical cost without affecting the solar inertial modes. The Boussinesq or incompressible approximations cannot be used to model the solar inertial modes accurately. Since the effects of differential rotation on the eigenmodes are very significant, an acceptable setup is to use the anelastic approximation together with the solar differential rotation.</description>

      <title>On variability of DDO68-V1, a unique extremely metal-poor LBV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DDO68-V1 is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star in the eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) galaxy DDO68. It resides in the HII region with 12+log(O/H)~7.1 dex, or Z ~ Zo/40. Since DDO68-V1 is the only known LBV with a so low initial metallicity, its in-deep study can give the hints for understanding the LBV evolutionary stage and the nature of their powerful and highly variable mass loss in the very low-metallicity regime. Our goal is to study the optical variability of DDO68-V1 during the last 36 years, with the emphasis on the period of the last 8 years, after the LBV giant eruption. We use our published results of monitoring in B, V, R bands of the total flux of HII region 'Knot 3', containing the LBV, along with photometry of the archive Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, obtained in May 2010 and December 2017. This data allow us to disentangle the variable light of DDO68-V1 and that of the underlying HII region. From all available photometry of Knot 3, we derive the V-band lightcurve of DDO68-V1 since 1988, with a higher cadence during the years 2015-2023, when the lightcurve resembles that of S Doradus. The new data reveal the full range of DDO68-V1 absolute magnitudes M_V of [-5.9, --10.8] mag. The LBV variations after the fading of the 'giant eruption' show the unusually large amplitude of delta_V &gt; 3.0-3.5mag on the time-scale of ~1-1.5 year. The apparent changes of the integrated B-V colour of Knot 3 are consistent with the expected colour variations of the LBV in course of the S Doradus 'normal eruptions'. These data, along with spectra of DDO68-V1, demonstrate the need for a higher-cadence photometry of DDO68-V1, in order to probe the possible periodicity in its lightcurve and binarity of the object.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent far-infrared polarization of HL Tau observed with SOFIA/HAWC+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>

      <title>The interplay between super-metallicity, lithium depletion, and radial migration in nearby stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a peculiar set of old super-metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between $\sim$ 0.5-1.5 kpc observed by the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. These stars show lithium (Li) depletion, which is anti-correlated with their [Fe/H]. To investigate these stars' chemo-dynamical properties, we used data from the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. We applied hierarchical clustering to group the stars based on their abundances (excluding Li). Orbits were integrated using \emph{Gaia} astrometry and radial velocities from \emph{Gaia}-ESO. Our analysis suggests that the high metallicity of these stars is incompatible with their formation in the solar neighbourhood. We also found that their Li envelope abundance is below the benchmark meteoritic value, in agreement with previous works. This result supports the idea that the Li abundance in old, super-metal-rich dwarf stars should not be considered a proxy for the local interstellar medium Li.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipses and pulsations are the two primary ways in which the physical properties of stars can be deduced and used to improve our understanding of stellar theory. An obvious idea is to combine these two analyses into the study of pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries. This is the aim of the SWIPE project. This paper summarises the scientific arguments, current status and future plans of the project.</description>

      <title>Discovery of metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence candidates in WLM with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of twelve metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates in the dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)~968 kpc away, at a present-day metallicity of [Fe/H] around $-$0.9. These candidates have masses between 1.25-5 M$_{\odot}$, with ages &lt;10 Myr, and exhibit significant near-infrared excesses at 2.5 and 4.3 $\mu$m. They are concentrated within a cluster roughly 10 pc (2'') across situated in the HII region [HM95]-9. These are the most distant and metal-poor PMS stars known, and can offer new quantitative insights into star formation at low-metallicities.</description>

      <title>Orbital Modeling of HII 1348B: An Eccentric Young Substellar Companion in the Pleiades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16429</link>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs with known physical properties (e.g., age and mass) are essential for constraining models of the formation and evolution of substellar objects. We present new high-contrast imaging observations of the circumbinary brown dwarf HII 1348B $\mathord{-}$ one of the few known substellar companions in the Pleiades cluster. We observed the system in the infrared (IR) $L^\prime$ band with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) in dual-aperture direct imaging mode (i.e., with the two telescope apertures used separately) on 2019 September 18. The observations attained a high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR} &gt; 150$) photometric detection and relative astrometry with uncertainties of ${\sim}5 \ \mathrm{mas}$. This work presents the first model of the companion's orbital motion using relative astrometry from five epochs across a total baseline of 23 years. Orbital fits to the compiled data show the companion's semimajor axis to be $a = 140 \substack{+130 \\ -30} \ \mathrm{au}$ with an eccentricity of $e = 0.78 \substack{+0.12 \\ -0.29}$. We infer that HII 1348B has a mass of $60\mathord{-}63 \pm 2 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ from comparison to brown dwarf evolutionary models given the well-constrained distance and age of the Pleiades. No other objects were detected in the HII 1348 system, and through synthetic planet injection and retrievals we establish detection limits at a cluster age of $112 \pm 5$ Myr down to ${\sim}10\mathord{-}30 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ for companions with projected separations of $21.5\mathord{-}280 \ \text{au}$. With this work, HII 1348B becomes the second directly imaged substellar companion in the Pleiades with measured orbital motion after HD 23514B.</description>

      <title>Mapping H$\alpha$-Excess Candidate Point Sources in the Southern Hemisphere Using S-PLUS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We use the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Fourth Data Release (DR4) to identify and classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources in the Southern Sky, combining photometric data from 12 S-PLUS filters with machine learning to improve classification of H$\alpha$-related phenomena. Aims. Our goal is to classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources by distinguishing Galactic and extragalactic objects, particularly those with redshifted emission lines, and identifying variability phenomena like RR Lyrae stars. Methods. We selected H$\alpha$-excess candidates using the ($r - J0660$) vs. ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram from the S-PLUS main survey (MS) and Galactic Disk Survey (GDS). UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering were used to separate source types. Infrared data was incorporated, and a Random Forest model was trained on clustering results to identify key colour features. New colour-colour diagrams from S-PLUS MS and infrared data offer a preliminary classification. Results. Combining multiwavelength data with machine learning significantly improved H$\alpha$-excess source classification. We identified 6956 sources with excess in the $J0660$ filter. Cross-matching with SIMBAD explored object types, including emission-line stars, young stellar objects, nebulae, stellar binaries, cataclysmic variables, QSOs, AGNs, and galaxies. Using S-PLUS colours and machine learning, we separated RR Lyrae stars from other sources. The separation of Galactic and extragalactic sources was clearer, but distinguishing cataclysmic variables from QSOs at certain redshifts remained challenging. Infrared data refined the classification, and the Random Forest model highlighted key colour features for future follow-up spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Discovery and Characterization of Two Brown Dwarfs Around M Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs bridge the gap between stars and planets, providing valuable insight into both planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Yet the census of transiting brown dwarf companions, in particular around M dwarf stars, remains incomplete. We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs around low-mass hosts using a combination of space- and ground-based photometry along with near-infrared radial velocities. We characterize TOI-5389Ab ($68.0^{+2.2}_{-2.2} \ \mj$) and TOI-5610b ($40.4^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \ \mj$), two moderately massive brown dwarfs orbiting early M dwarf hosts ($\teff = 3569 \pm 59 \ K$ and $3618 \pm 59 \ K$, respectively). For TOI-5389Ab, the best fitting parameters are period $P=10.40046 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.824^{+0.033}_{-0.031}$~\rj, and low eccentricity $e=0.0962^{+0.0027}_{-0.0046}$. In particular, this constitutes one of the most extreme substellar-stellar companion-to-host mass ratios of $q=0.150$. For TOI-5610b, the best fitting parameters are period $P=7.95346 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.887^{+0.031}_{-0.031}$ \rj, and moderate eccentricity $e=0.354^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$. Both targets are expected to have shallow but potentially observable secondary transits: $\lesssim 500$ ppm in Johnson K band for both. A statistical analysis of M-dwarf/BD systems reveals for the first time that those at short orbital periods ($P &lt; 13$ days) exhibit a dearth of $13 \mj &lt; M_{\rm BD} &lt; 40 \mj$ companions ($q$ $&lt;$ 0.1) compared to those at slightly wider separations.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Star formation from low to high mass: A comparative view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation has often been studied by separating the low- and high-mass regimes with an approximate boundary at 8M_sun. While some of the outcomes of the star-formation process are different between the two regimes, it is less clear whether the physical processes leading to these outcomes are that different at all. Here, we systematically compare low- and high-mass star formation by reviewing the most important processes and quantities from an observational and theoretical point of view. We identify three regimes where processes are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between low- and high-mass star formation.
  Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties and density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational characteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment.
  Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates as well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity significantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the magnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained.
  Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate mainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in regions forming high-mass stars. Nevertheless, accretion apparently can continue via disk structures in ionized accretion flows.
  Finally, we discuss to what extent a unified picture of star formation over all masses is possible and which issues need to be addressed in the future.</description>

Abstract: White dwarfs are one of the densest form of matter following neutron star and black holes. A typical white dwarf is as massive as our sun has radius comparable to the earth. This paper reviewed the Fermi gas model Equation of State of white dwarfs and numerical computation of mass-radius and pressure density profile. A section in brief has been included for the calculation of average speed of electrons in the white dwarf environment.</description>

      <title>Conditioning of the solar corona due to large flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to better characterize the conditions of the solar corona, especially with respect to the occurrence of confined and eruptive flares. In this work, we model the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar cycle 24. Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data around each event, we employed nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to approximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source regions. A superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the time series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities were used to pin down the characteristics of the pre- and postflare time evolution, as well as to assess flare-related changes. During the 24 hours leading up to a major flare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux were seen to evolve closely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to confined flares, the free energy evolves in a way that exhibits more of a similarity with the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying field, while the opposite trend is seen prior to eruptive flares. Furthermore, the flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\% of major flares when combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local stability. The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels within approximately six to 12 hours after eruptive major M-class flares, while the impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. Finally, the postflare replenishment times of more than 12 hours after eruptive X-class flares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive X-class flares within a time frame of a few hours.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>BPASS stellar evolution models incorporating $\alpha$-enhanced composition -- I. Single star models from 0.1 to 316 M$_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda &gt; 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $&gt; 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Dwarf Galaxy Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation Resolving Individual Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a dwarf galaxy cosmological zoom-in simulation resolving individual massive stars. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>

      <title>Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>
