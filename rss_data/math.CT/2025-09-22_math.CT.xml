      <title>The formal theory of tangentads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangent categories offer a categorical context for differential geometry, by categorifying geometric notions like the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, vector bundles, connections, etc. In the last decade, the theory has been extended in new directions, providing concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, reverse tangent categories and many more.
  It is natural to wonder how these new flavours interact with the geometric constructions offered by the theory. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of vector fields of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of vector bundles for a tangent restriction category?
  In this paper, we answer these questions by adopting the formal approach of tangentads. Introduced in a previous paper, tangentads proved to be a powerful tool for capturing the different flavours of the theory and for extending constructions like the Grothendieck construction or the equivalence between split restriction categories and $\mathscr{M}$-categories, to the tangent-categorical context.
  We construct formal notions of vector fields, differential objects, differential bundles, and connections for tangentads by isolating the correct universal properties enjoyed by these constructions in ordinary tangent categories. We show that vector fields form a Lie algebra and a $2$-monad; we extend the result that differential bundles over the terminal object are equivalent to differential objects; we recapture the notions of covariant derivative, curvature and torsion for connections. We also show how to construct vector fields and connections using PIE limits, and we compute the formal constructions for some examples of tangentads.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.</description>

      <title>Affine Frobenius Brauer Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the affine Frobenius Brauer categories associated to each symmetric involutive Frobenius superalgebra $A$. We then define an action of these categories on the categories of finite-dimensional supermodules for orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras defined over $A$. When $A$ is the base field, we recover the previously-studied affine Brauer category; for other choices of $A$, the categories are novel. Finally, we state a conjecture for bases of homomorphism spaces in affine Frobenius Brauer categories, and outline a potential proof strategy.</description>

      <title>The index in $d$-exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from its original definition in module categories with respect to projective modules, the index has played an important role in various aspects of homological algebra, categorification of cluster algebras and $K$-theory. In the last few years, the notion of index has been generalised to several different contexts in (higher) homological algebra, typically with respect to a (higher) cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of the relevant ambient category $\mathcal{C}$. The recent tools of extriangulated and higher-exangulated categories have permitted some conditions on the subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ to be relaxed. In this paper, we introduce the index with respect to a generating, contravariantly finite subcategory of a $d$-exact category that has $d$-kernels. We show that our index has the important property of being additive on $d$-exact sequences up to an error term.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced by David Spivak about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to manifold learning, dimension reduction and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions. We generalize the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$, and show that $\mathbf{UM}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$. Furthermore, we prove analogous results for the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$. We also provide rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. Additionally, we developed a new embedding method that allows to preserve clusters detected in the original metric space that we construct from the data. The visualization of the optimization process gives the user information, both about the inner-cluster distributions in the original metric space and their inter-cluster relations. We compare our new method with UMAP, Isomap and t-SNE on a series of low- and high-dimensional datasets and provide explanations for observed differences and improvements.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monads and Biproducts: A Uniform Interpretation of Parallelism in Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to modelling parallelism and algebraic structure in lambda calculi often rely on monads$\unicode{x2013}$as in Moggi's framework$\unicode{x2013}$or on rich categorical structures such as biproducts$\unicode{x2013}$as used in certain models of linear logic. In this work, we propose a minimal alternative that captures both parallelism and weighted parallelism (linear combinations) within the setting of intuitionistic propositional logic, without resorting to monads or assuming the existence of biproducts.
  We introduce two lambda calculi: a parallel lambda calculus and an algebraic lambda calculus, both extending full propositional intuitionistic logic. Their semantics are given in two categories: ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and arrows are functions in $\mathbf{Set}$; and ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas.
  The key technical challenge addressed is the interpretation of disjunction in the presence of parallel and algebraic operators. Since the usual coproduct structure is unavailable in our minimal setting, we propose a novel set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product. This allows for the construction of sound and adequate models for both calculi.
  Our results offer a unified and structurally lightweight framework for modelling parallelism and algebraic effects in intuitionistic logic, opening the way to alternatives beyond the traditional monadic or linear logic approaches.</description>

      <title>Categorical approach to graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a natural category of graph limits. The objects are pairs $(\pi,\mu)$, where $\pi$ (the distribution of vertices) is an abstract probability measure on some abstract measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $\mu$ (the distribution of edges) is an abstract finite measure on the square $(X,\mathcal{A})^2$. Morphisms are random maps between the underlying measurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as the distribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired by s-convergence) for sequences of graph limits. We apply tools from category theory to prove the compactness of the space of all graph limits.</description>

      <title>A model for the assembly map of bordism-invariant functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study oplax colimits of stable categories, of hermitian categories and of Poincar\'e categories in nice cases. This allows us to produce a categorical model of the assembly map of a bordism-invariant functor of Poincar\'e categories which is also a Verdier projection, whose kernel we explicitly describe. As a direct application, we generalize the Shaneson splitting for bordism-invariant functors of Poincar\'e categories proved by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle to allow for twists. We also show our methods can tackle their general twisted Shaneson splitting of Poincar\'e-Verdier localizing invariants which specifies to a twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the underlying stable categories, generalizing part of recent work of Kirstein-Kremer.</description>
