      <title>Note on energy index and first eigenvalue of minimal surfaces in spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal immersion from a surface to $S^3$ can be viewed both as a critical point of the area and of the energy. Although no difference appears at first order, looking at the respective second variations unveils significant differences. It is well known that whenever the first eigenvalue satisfies $\lambda_1(\Sigma)\geq2$, the index is $\mathrm{ind}_E(\Sigma)\leq 4$. The converse implication is much more subtle. We prove that whenever $\lambda_1(\Sigma)&lt;\frac{1}{6}$, there exists a vector field $X$, orthogonal to the four M\"obius vector fields, with negative second variation. We also prove an arbitrary codimension version of this statement: any immersed minimal surface $\Sigma\subset S^n$ with first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\Sigma)&lt;\frac{n-2}{2n}$ admits a vector field $X$ orthogonal to the $n+1$ M\"obius fields with negative second variation.</description>

      <title>The Ricci tensor of a gradient Ricci soliton with harmonic Weyl tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give a new proof of a result due to J. Kim, which states that the Ricci tensor of a gradient Ricci soliton with dimension $n \geq 4$ and harmonic Weyl tensor has at most three distinct eigenvalues. This result constitutes an essential step in the classification of such manifolds, originally established by J. Kim in dimension $4$ and subsequently extended to dimensions $n\geq5$. Our proof offers two notable advantages: it is shorter and does not require the use of any specialized moving frame.</description>

      <title>Local umbilic, convexity and cylindrical estimates for fully nonlinear curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, a localization of the Huisken--Stampacchia iteration method was developed, and used to establish localizations of the well-known "umbilic", "convexity" and "cylindrical" estimates for hypersurfaces evolving in Euclidean space by mean curvature flow. Here, we adapt the methods developed there to treat more general (fully nonlinear) flows, establishing localizations of asymptotically sharp curvature pinching estimates for hypersurfaces evolving by one-homogeneous functions of curvature under very general conditions. We also briefly describe how the method can be adapted to treat the deformation of hypersurfaces in curved ambient spaces (by suitable speed functions), which is fundamental for many important applications of such flows.</description>

      <title>On Hopf hypersurfaces of the complex hyperbolic quadric with constant principal curvatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hopf hypersurfaces of the complex hyperbolic quadric $Q^{m*}=SO^o_{2,m}/(SO_2\times SO_m)$ ($m\geq3$) with constant principal curvatures. We classify the Hopf hypersurfaces of $Q^{m*}$ ($m\geq3$) with at most two distinct constant principal curvatures. For Hopf hypersurfaces with three or four distinct constant principal curvatures, we determine the values of the principal curvatures as well as their multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surfaces of Finite Genus: Classification, Dynamics and Laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explains a program to study complete and properly embedded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ developed jointly with W.H. Meeks and A. Ros in the last three decades. It follows closely the structure of my invited ICM talk with the same title and supplies details and references to the original papers. After recalling the role of the classical Riemann minimal examples in minimal surface theory, we explain our four-step classification of properly embedded minimal surfaces of genus zero and infinite topology in $\mathbb{R}^3$: the periodic case, the quasi-periodicity of the two-limit-ended case, the non-existence of one-limit-ended examples, and the final classification. We then review the lamination techniques (limit-leaf stability, local removable singularity, and singular structure theorems), the dynamics theorem, bounds on topology and index for complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite total curvature, and the resolution of the embedded Calabi-Yau problem for finite genus and countably many ends. Throughout we emphasize the interaction between topology, flux, curvature estimates, and the structure of related moduli spaces. We end this article with a list of some open problems.</description>

      <title>On the structure of noncollapsed Ricci flow limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a weak compactness theorem for the moduli space of closed Ricci flows with uniformly bounded entropy, each equipped with a natural spacetime distance, under pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. Furthermore, we develop a structure theory for the corresponding Ricci flow limit spaces, showing that the regular part, where convergence is smooth, admits the structure of a Ricci flow spacetime, while the singular set has codimension at least four.</description>

      <title>Gradient Einstein-type Sasakian manifolds with $\alpha=0$ are trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12441v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catino, Mastrolia, Monticelli, and Rigoli have launched an ambitious program to study known geometric solitons from a unified perspective, termed Einstein-type manifolds. This framework allows one to treat Ricci solitons, Yamabe solitons, and all of their generalizations simultaneously. Einstein-type manifolds are characterized by four constants $\alpha, \beta, \mu$ and $\rho$. In this paper, we show that when $\alpha = 0$ gradient Einstein-type Sasakian manifolds are trivial. As a consequence, many geometric solitons on Sasakian manifolds turn out to be trivial.</description>

      <title>Local mollification of metrics with small curvature concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a local smoothing result on metrics with small curvature concentration with respect to Sobolev constants and volume growth. In contrast with all previous works, we remove the Ricci curvature condition and completely localize the smoothing. As an application, we prove the compactness of the space of compact manifolds with bounded curvature concentration under Ahlfors $n$-regularity and bounded Sobolev constant. In the complete non-compact case, we show that manifolds with Euclidean type Sobolev inequality, Euclidean volume growth, and small curvature concentration are necessarily diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Partial Poisson Lie groups and groupoids. Application to Von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a version of the notion of convenient Lie groupoid as a generalization of this concept in finite dimension. The authors point out which obstructions appear in the infinite dimensional context and how an adapted notion of "bi-algebroid " in finite dimension (cf. \cite{MaXu94}) can be, nevertheless, recovered. This paper is self-contained and recalls some important properties of "partial Poisson manifolds" (cf. \cite{CaPe23}, Chapter~7) and "Banach Poisson Lie groups" (cf. \cite{Tum20}) needed for their purpose. The paper also gives an illustration of these concepts from all the results of A.~Odzijewicz and his collaborators on Lie groupoids and Von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Generic special Lagrangian moduli spaces of a non-K\"ahler Calabi--Yau threefold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a (possibly non-K\"ahler) Calabi--Yau threefold $(X,\Omega)$, we introduce the notion of a (perturbed) special Lagrangian (SL) submanifold of $(X,\omega,\Omega)$, where $\omega$ is a Hermitian metric on $X$. The equations defining this class of submanifolds reduce to the usual SL equations when $\omega$ is a K\"ahler metric. Using the Sard--Smale technique, we prove the existence of a comeagre set of Hermitian metrics $\omega$ on $X$ such that the moduli space of perturbed SL submanifolds in $(X,\omega,\Omega)$ consists of isolated points.</description>

      <title>Geometric study of non-constant vector fields making hyperbolic space Ricci-Bourguignon solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to deepen the study of vector fields on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$ that transform them into a Ricci-Bourguignon soliton. Starting from a recent work in \cite{bousso2025ricci} which characterizes these fields as Killing fields of a specific shape, we propose a detailed geometric study of their structure and behavior in the dimensions $n=2, 3$ and $n\geq 3$. In odd dimension we show that the dual form of these vectors are contact forms. This work aims to enrich the understanding of self-similar solutions of the Ricci flow in a more general context.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structures for $G_2'$-Surface Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We construct locally homogeneous geometric structures on closed 5-manifolds fibering over $S$, modeled on the two partial flag manifolds $\mathrm{Ein}^{2,3}$ and $\mathrm{Pho}^\times$ of the split real form $\mathrm{G}_2'$ of the complex exceptional Lie group $\mathrm{G}_2^{\mathbb{C}}$. To this end, we consider two families of representations $\pi_1S\rightarrow \mathrm{G}_2'$ constructed via the non-abelian Hodge correspondence from cyclic Higgs bundles, one associated with each $\mathrm{G}_2'$-partial flag manifold. Each family includes $\mathrm{G}_2'$-Hitchin representations, but is much more general. For each representation of the first family, the $\beta$-bundles, we construct $(\mathrm{G}_2', \mathrm{Ein}^{2,3})$-geometric structures on $\mathrm{Ein}^{2,1}$-fiber bundles over $S$, and for Hodge bundles in the second family we construct $(\mathrm{G}_2, \mathrm{Pho}^\times)$-geometric structures on $(\mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1)$-bundles over $S$. In the case of $\mathrm{G}_2'$-Hitchin Hodge bundles, which belong to both families, we show the image of the developing map of the respective geometric structures is exactly the domain of discontinuity defined by Guichard-Wienhard and Kapovich-Leeb-Porti.
  Each construction can be interpreted as converting a family of equivariant $J$-holomorphic curves in the pseudosphere $\mathbb{S}^{2,4}$ into geometric structures on fiber bundles $M \rightarrow S$. The approach used to build geometric structures, namely \emph{moving bases of pencils}, gives a unified description of analytic geometric structures constructions using Higgs bundles and harmonic maps in rank two.</description>

      <title>General Casorati inequalities and implications for Riemannian maps and Riemannian submersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents general forms of Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps and Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds. Using these general forms, we obtain Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps (resp. submersions) whose target (resp. source) spaces are generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms. As a consequence, we give Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps (resp. submersions) when the target (resp. source) spaces are real, complex, real K\"ahler, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and almost $C(\alpha)$ space forms. Toward the affirmation of these general forms, in the particular cases when the target or source spaces are real, complex, Sasakian, and Kenmotsu space forms, we verify known Casorati inequalities for Riemannian maps and Riemannian submersions. Further, we give Casorati inequalities for invariant and anti-invariant Riemannian maps (resp. submersions) whose target (resp. source) spaces are generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms. Toward information on geometric characteristics, we discuss the equality cases.</description>

      <title>The Linearized Einstein Equations with Sources on Compact Riemannian Manifolds With Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider compact Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary interior geometry, assuming only that the Ricci tensor vanishes on the boundary. In this setting, we prove that, under the linear Bianchi gauge and extended Cauchy data, the linearized Einstein equations with sources are globally solvable if and only if the source lies in the kernel of a lifted divergence operator and vanishes on the boundary; the solution is unique. This is the first result of its kind without rigid structural restrictions on topology, geometry, or source. The proof combines generalized Hodge theory with unique continuation results.</description>

      <title>Semi-Global Existence and Trapped Surface Formation for the Einstein-Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large-data semi-global existence theorem and the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1 dimensions, without any symmetry assumptions. The analysis critically hinges on a finely calibrated hierarchy of estimates for the Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments of the distribution function, designed to capture the delicate interaction between the geometric and kinetic structures of the coupled system. The presence of the Vlasov field introduces significant analytic challenges, both in terms of integrability and regularity. These are circumvented through a refined renormalization of the Ricci coefficients, a strategic restriction of the need for the elliptic estimates to a minimal number of Ricci coefficients, and a precise commutator calculus adapted to the geometry of the mass-shell of the tangent bundle of the dynamical spacetime. The results constitute the first large-data, symmetry-free construction of dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter. Beyond its immediate application to the Einstein-Vlasov system in regimes of strong gravitational interaction and absence of symmetry, we anticipate that this framework will prove useful in a broader context, including, for instance, simplified approaches to the proof of nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with massless Vlasov matter</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of random matrices is said to converge strongly to a limiting family of operators if the operator norm of every noncommutative polynomial of the matrices converges to that of the limiting operators. Recent developments surrounding the strong convergence phenomenon have led to new progress on important problems in random graphs, geometry, operator algebras, and applied mathematics. We review classical and recent results in this area, and their applications to various areas of mathematics.</description>

      <title>On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the density of coadjoint orbits, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

      <title>First-order elliptic boundary value problems on manifolds with non-compact boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider first-order elliptic differential operators acting on vector bundles over smooth manifolds with smooth boundary, which is permitted to be noncompact. Under very mild assumptions, we obtain a regularity theory for sections in the maximal domain. Under additional geometric assumptions, and assumptions on an adapted boundary operator, we obtain a trace theorem on the maximal domain. This allows us to systematically study both local and nonlocal boundary conditions. In particular, the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition occurs as a special case. Furthermore, we study contexts which induce semi-Fredholm and Fredholm extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of chiral geometric operators and use Gilkey's invariance theory to prove the local index theorem for these operators. In other words, we demonstrate that the supertrace of the heat kernel of a given geometric operator converges as time approaches zero and that this limit is the Chern-Weil form of the Atiyah-Singer integrand. In addition to classical Dirac-type operators that appear in geometry, chiral geometric operators include all higher Dirac operators. This includes in particular the Rarita-Schwinger operator. We also construct a new class of such operators on four-manifolds called higher signature operators.</description>

Abstract: The existence and uniqueness of canonical singular solutions of the J-equation and the deformed Hermitian Yang Mills (dHYM) equation was proved in \cite{DMS24} on compact K\"{a}hler surfaces. In this paper, we study the singularity formation of the dHYM cotangent flow on the one-point blow up of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^3$ using Calabi ansatz. In particular, we provide an explicit example where the flow develops a singularity along the exceptional divisor. Moreover, the limit satisfies corresponding singular dHYM equation in the sense of \cite{DMS24} and provides some evidence for Conjecture $1.12$ in \cite{DMS24} on this three-dimensional manifold with symmetry.</description>

      <title>Generic properties of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open Riemann surface and $n\ge 3$ be an integer. In this paper we establish some generic properties (in Baire category sense) in the space of all conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the compact-open topology, pointing out that a generic such immersion is chaotic in many ways. For instance, we show that a generic conformal minimal immersion $u\colon M\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is non-proper, almost proper, and $g$-complete with respect to any given Riemannian metric $g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Further, its image $u(M)$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and disjoint from $\mathbb{Q}^3\times \mathbb{R}^{n-3}$, and has infinite area, infinite total curvature, and unbounded curvature on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In case $n=3$, we also prove that a generic conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ has infinite index of stability on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>On the Gauss map assignment for minimal surfaces and the Osserman curvature estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gauss map of a conformal minimal immersion of an open Riemann surface $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 3$, is a holomorphic map $M\to{\bf Q}^{n-2}\subset \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. Denote by ${\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$ the spaces of full conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and full holomorphic maps $M\to{\bf Q}^{n-2}$, respectively, endowed with the compact-open topology. In this paper we show that the Gauss map assignment $\mathscr{G}:{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$, taking a full conformal minimal immersion to its Gauss map, is an open map. This implies, in view of a result of Forstneric and the authors, that $\mathscr{G}$ is a quotient map. The same results hold for the map $(\mathscr{G},Flux):{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})\times H^1(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $Flux:{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to H^1(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the flux assignment.
  As application, we establish that the set of maps $G\in \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$ such that the family $\mathscr{G}^{-1}(G)$ of all minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Gauss map $G$ satisfies the classical Osserman curvature estimate, is meagre in the space of holomorphic maps $M\to {\bf Q}^{n-2}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Riemannian Lie groups with nilpotency step 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive sharp estimates comparing asymptotic Riemannian or sub-Riemannian metrics in 2-step nilpotent Lie groups. For each metric, we construct a Carnot metric whose square remains at bounded distance from the square of the original metric. In particular, we deduce the analogue of a conjectire by Burago-Margulis: every 2-step nilpotent Riemannian Lie group is at bounded distance from its asymptotic cone. As a consequence, we obtain a refined estimate of the error term in the asymptotic expansion of the volume of the (sub-)Riemannian metric balls. To achive this, we develop a novel technique to efficiently perturb rectifiable curves modifying their endpoints in a prescribed vertical direction.</description>

Abstract: We discover an explicit construction of non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n},n\geq 3$, using a variant of ellipsoidal coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The branching set of these examples is a codimension-$2$ ellipsoid, providing the first known family of non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-forms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with compact branching sets. Moreover, the graph of the related $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic one form in $T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be obtained as a certain limit of a specific sequence of Lawlor's necks in $\mathbb{C}^{n}=T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the orthogonal Stiefel manifold, viewed as a constraint submanifold of the Euclidean space of real matrices equipped with the Frobenius metric. Using the general framework of Laplace operators on constraint manifolds, we provide the formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the ambient Euclidean coordinates. The result extends previously known cases, recovering the formulas for the sphere and the special orthogonal group as particular instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a $C^0$-fragmentation property for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. More precisely, it is known that for a given open covering $\mathcal{U}$ of a compact symplectic surface we can write each $C^0$-small enough Hamiltonian diffeomorphism as the composition of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms compactly supported inside the open sets of the covering $\mathcal{U}$. We show that such a decomposition can be done with a Lipschitz estimate on the $C^0$-norm of the fragments. We also show the same property for the kernel of $\theta$, the mass-flow homomorphism for homeomorphisms. This answers a question from Buhovsky and Seyfaddini.</description>

Abstract: We present a proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality -- a central conjecture in extended black hole thermodynamics -- for black holes in Einstein gravity with $D \geq 4$, employing a two-pronged geometric-analytic method. Our analysis shows that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality originates from the structure of curved backgrounds governed by Einstein's equations, thereby underscoring the fundamental role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric property of AdS black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>The epsilon-regularity theorem for Brakke flows near triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem for $k$-dimensional, possibly forced, Brakke flows near a static, multiplicity-one triple junction. This result provides the parabolic analogue to L. Simon's foundational work on the singular set of stationary varifolds and confirms that the regular structure of triple junctions persists under weak mean curvature flow. The regularity holds provided the flow satisfies a mild structural assumption on its 1-dimensional slices taken orthogonal to the junction's $(k-1)$-dimensional spine, which prohibits certain topological degeneracies. We prove that this assumption is automatically satisfied by two fundamental classes of flows where such singularities are expected: codimension-one multi-phase flows, such as the canonical $\mathrm{BV}$-Brakke flows constructed by the authors, and flows of arbitrary codimension with the structure of a mod 3 integral current, which arise from Ilmanen's elliptic regularization. For such flows, therefore, the Simon type regularity holds unconditionally.</description>
