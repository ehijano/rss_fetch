      <title>An introduction to the fine structures on the $S$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holomorphic functions are fundamental in operator theory and their Cauchy formula is a crucial tool for defining functions of operators. The Fueter-Sce extension theorem (often called Fueter-Sce mapping theorem) provides a two-step procedure for extending holomorphic functions to hyperholomorphic functions. In the first step, slice hyperholomorphic functions are obtained, and their associated Cauchy formula establishes the $S$-functional calculus for noncommuting operators on the $S$-spectrum. The second step produces axially monogenic functions, which lead to the development of the monogenic functional calculus. In this review paper we discuss the second operator in the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem that takes slice hyperholomorphic to axially monogenic functions. This operator admits several factorizations which generate various function spaces and their corresponding functional calculi, thereby forming the so-called fine structures of spectral theories on the $S$-spectrum.</description>

      <title>A note on the magnetic Steklov operator on functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Steklov eigenvalue problem on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary for generic magnetic potentials and establish various results concerning the spectrum. We show a Shikegawa type gauge-equivalence for the magnetic Steklov operator and study bounds for the smallest eigenvalue. We prove a Cheeger-Jammes type lower bound for the first eigenvalue by introducing magnetic Cheeger constants that involve the notion of frustration index of domains. We also obtain an analogue of an upper bound for the first magnetic Neumann eigenvalue due to Colbois, El Soufi, Ilias and Savo. In addition, we compute the full spectrum in the case of the Euclidean $2$-ball and $4$-ball for a particular choice of magnetic potential given by Killing vector fields, and discuss the behavior. Finally, we establish a comparison result for the magnetic Steklov operator associated with the manifold and the square root of the magnetic Laplacian on the boundary, which generalises the uniform geometric upper bounds for the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues in the non-magnetic case due to Colbois, Girouard and Hassannezhad.</description>

      <title>Neumann domains of planar analytic eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with the partition of a planar bounded domain $\Omega$ by the nodal set of a fixed eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$, one can consider another natural partition of $\Omega$ by, roughly speaking, gradient flow lines of a special type (separatrices) of this eigenfunction. Elements of such partition are called Neumann domains and their boundaries are Neumann lines. When the eigenfunction is a Morse function, this partition corresponds to the Morse--Smale complex and its fundamental properties have been systematically investigated by Band &amp; Fajman (2016). Although, in the case of general position, eigenfunctions are always of the Morse type, particular eigenfunctions can possess degenerate critical points. In the present work, we propose a way to characterize Neumann domains and lines of an arbitrary eigenfunction. Instead of requiring the nondegeneracy of critical points of the eigenfunction, its real analyticity is principally used. The analyticity allows for the presence of degenerate critical points but significantly limits their possible diversity. Even so, the eigenfunction can possess curves of critical points, which have to belong naturally to the Neumann lines set, as well as critical points of a saddle-node type. We overview all possible types of degenerate critical points in the eigenfunction's critical set and provide a numerically based evidence that each of them can be observed for particular eigenfunctions. Alongside with [Band &amp; Fajman, 2016], our approach is inspired by a little-known note of Weinberger that appeared back in 1963, where a part of the Neumann line set, under the name of "effectless cut", was explicitly introduced and studied for the first eigenfunctions in domains with nontrivial topology. In addition, we provide an asymptotic counting of Neumann domains for a disk and rectangles in analogy with the Pleijel constant.</description>

      <title>On the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>
