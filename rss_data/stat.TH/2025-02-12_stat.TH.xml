      <title>Cheap Permutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation tests are a popular choice for distinguishing distributions and testing independence, due to their exact, finite-sample control of false positives and their minimax optimality when paired with U-statistics. However, standard permutation tests are also expensive, requiring a test statistic to be computed hundreds or thousands of times to detect a separation between distributions. In this work, we offer a simple approach to accelerate testing: group your datapoints into bins and permute only those bins. For U and V-statistics, we prove that these cheap permutation tests have two remarkable properties. First, by storing appropriate sufficient statistics, a cheap test can be run in time comparable to evaluating a single test statistic. Second, cheap permutation power closely approximates standard permutation power. As a result, cheap tests inherit the exact false positive control and minimax optimality of standard permutation tests while running in a fraction of the time. We complement these findings with improved power guarantees for standard permutation testing and experiments demonstrating the benefits of cheap permutations over standard maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), random Fourier feature, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, cross-MMD, and cross-HSIC tests.</description>

      <title>Sharp Anti-Concentration Inequalities for Extremum Statistics via Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the pointwise concentration function of the maximum statistic of $d$ identically distributed real-valued random variables. Our first main result places no restrictions either on the common marginal law of the samples or on the copula describing their joint distribution. We show that, in general, strictly sublinear dependence of the concentration function on the dimension $d$ is not possible. We then introduce a new class of copulas, namely those with a convex diagonal section, and demonstrate that restricting to this class yields a sharper upper bound on the concentration function. This allows us to establish several new dimension-independent and poly-logarithmic-in-$d$ anti-concentration inequalities for a variety of marginal distributions under mild dependence assumptions. Our theory improves upon the best known results in certain special cases. Applications to high-dimensional statistical inference are presented, including a specific example pertaining to Gaussian mixture approximations for factor models, for which our main results lead to superior distributional guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Transition Density Expansion for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a closed-form expansion for the transition density of elliptic and hypo-elliptic multivariate Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), over a period $\Delta\in (0,1)$, in terms of powers of $\Delta^{j/2}$, $j\ge 0$. Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions. The latter are sufficient for controlling the remainder terms, but the closed-form expansion itself is applicable in general settings.</description>

      <title>General-Purpose $f$-DP Estimation and Auditing in a Black-Box Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose new methods to statistically assess $f$-Differential Privacy ($f$-DP), a recent refinement of differential privacy (DP) that remedies certain weaknesses of standard DP (including tightness under algorithmic composition). A challenge when deploying differentially private mechanisms is that DP is hard to validate, especially in the black-box setting. This has led to numerous empirical methods for auditing standard DP, while $f$-DP remains less explored. We introduce new black-box methods for $f$-DP that, unlike existing approaches for this privacy notion, do not require prior knowledge of the investigated algorithm. Our procedure yields a complete estimate of the $f$-DP trade-off curve, with theoretical guarantees of convergence. Additionally, we propose an efficient auditing method that empirically detects $f$-DP violations with statistical certainty, merging techniques from non-parametric estimation and optimal classification theory. Through experiments on a range of DP mechanisms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimation and auditing procedures.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Learning for k-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a $k$-SAT formula $\Phi$ where every variable appears at most $d$ times, and let $\sigma$ be a satisfying assignment of $\Phi$ sampled proportionally to $e^{\beta m(\sigma)}$ where $m(\sigma)$ is the number of variables set to true and $\beta$ is a real parameter. Given $\Phi$ and $\sigma$, can we learn the value of $\beta$ efficiently?
  This problem falls into a recent line of works about single-sample ("one-shot") learning of Markov random fields. The $k$-SAT setting we consider here was recently studied by Galanis, Kandiros, and Kalavasis (SODA'24) where they showed that single-sample learning is possible when roughly $d\leq 2^{k/6.45}$ and impossible when $d\geq (k+1) 2^{k-1}$. Crucially, for their impossibility results they used the existence of unsatisfiable instances which, aside from the gap in $d$, left open the question of whether the feasibility threshold for one-shot learning is dictated by the satisfiability threshold of $k$-SAT formulas of bounded degree.
  Our main contribution is to answer this question negatively. We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction. On the positive side, we simplify the analysis of the learning algorithm and obtain significantly stronger bounds on $d$ in terms of $\beta$. In particular, for the uniform case $\beta\rightarrow 0$ that has been studied extensively in the sampling literature, our analysis shows that learning is possible under the condition $d\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. This is nearly optimal (up to constant factors) in the sense that it is known that sampling a uniformly-distributed satisfying assignment is NP-hard for $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Confidence Best Arm Identification with Decreasing Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of best-arm identification in a stochastic multi-arm bandit with temporally decreasing variances for the arms' rewards. We model arm rewards as Gaussian random variables with fixed means and variances that decrease with time. The cost incurred by the learner is modeled as a weighted sum of the time needed by the learner to identify the best arm, and the number of samples of arms collected by the learner before termination. Under this cost function, there is an incentive for the learner to not sample arms in all rounds, especially in the initial rounds. On the other hand, not sampling increases the termination time of the learner, which also increases cost. This trade-off necessitates new sampling strategies. We propose two policies. The first policy has an initial wait period with no sampling followed by continuous sampling. The second policy samples periodically and uses a weighted average of the rewards observed to identify the best arm. We provide analytical guarantees on the performance of both policies and supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that our polices outperform the state-of-the-art policies for the classical best arm identification problem.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Proximal Sampler for High-accuracy Sampling on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Riemannian Proximal Sampler, a method for sampling from densities defined on Riemannian manifolds. The performance of this sampler critically depends on two key oracles: the Manifold Brownian Increments (MBI) oracle and the Riemannian Heat-kernel (RHK) oracle. We establish high-accuracy sampling guarantees for the Riemannian Proximal Sampler, showing that generating samples with $\varepsilon$-accuracy requires $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations in Kullback-Leibler divergence assuming access to exact oracles and $O(\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations in the total variation metric assuming access to sufficiently accurate inexact oracles. Furthermore, we present practical implementations of these oracles by leveraging heat-kernel truncation and Varadhan's asymptotics. In the latter case, we interpret the Riemannian Proximal Sampler as a discretization of the entropy-regularized Riemannian Proximal Point Method on the associated Wasserstein space. We provide preliminary numerical results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Uniform Kernel Prober</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to identify useful features or representations of the input data based on training data that achieves low prediction error on test data across multiple prediction tasks is considered the key to multitask learning success. In practice, however, one faces the issue of the choice of prediction tasks and the availability of test data from the chosen tasks while comparing the relative performance of different features. In this work, we develop a class of pseudometrics called Uniform Kernel Prober (UKP) for comparing features or representations learned by different statistical models such as neural networks when the downstream prediction tasks involve kernel ridge regression. The proposed pseudometric, UKP, between any two representations, provides a uniform measure of prediction error on test data corresponding to a general class of kernel ridge regression tasks for a given choice of a kernel without access to test data. Additionally, desired invariances in representations can be successfully captured by UKP only through the choice of the kernel function and the pseudometric can be efficiently estimated from $n$ input data samples with $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ estimation error. We also experimentally demonstrate the ability of UKP to discriminate between different types of features or representations based on their generalization performance on downstream kernel ridge regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Overfitting Regimes of Nadaraya-Watson Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.</description>

      <title>Isotonic Mechanism for Exponential Family Estimation in Machine Learning Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) required authors with multiple submissions to rank their submissions based on perceived quality. In this paper, we aim to employ these author-specified rankings to enhance peer review in machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences by extending the Isotonic Mechanism to exponential family distributions. This mechanism generates adjusted scores that closely align with the original scores while adhering to author-specified rankings. Despite its applicability to a broad spectrum of exponential family distributions, implementing this mechanism does not require knowledge of the specific distribution form. We demonstrate that an author is incentivized to provide accurate rankings when her utility takes the form of a convex additive function of the adjusted review scores. For a certain subclass of exponential family distributions, we prove that the author reports truthfully only if the question involves only pairwise comparisons between her submissions, thus indicating the optimality of ranking in truthful information elicitation. Moreover, we show that the adjusted scores improve dramatically the estimation accuracy compared to the original scores and achieve nearly minimax optimality when the ground-truth scores have bounded total variation. We conclude with a numerical analysis of the ICML 2023 ranking data, showing substantial estimation gains in approximating a proxy ground-truth quality of the papers using the Isotonic Mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of random bipartite networks, the distribution of which is invariant under permutation within each type of nodes. We are interested in $U$-statistics defined on the adjacency matrix of such a network, for which we define a new type of Hoeffding decomposition based on the Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg representation of row-column exchangeable matrices. This decomposition enables us to characterize non-degenerate $U$-statistics -- which are then asymptotically normal -- and provides us with a natural and easy-to-implement estimator of their asymptotic variance. \\ We illustrate the use of this general approach on some typical random graph models and use it to estimate or test some quantities characterizing the topology of the associated network. We also assess the accuracy and the power of the proposed estimates or tests, via a simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key result of this paper is to characterize all the multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions whose sum is minimal under convex order. In doing so, we automatically characterize extremal negative dependence among Bernoulli variables, since multivariate distributions with minimal convex sums are known to be strongly negative dependent. Moreover, beyond its interest per se, this result provides insight into negative dependence within the class of copulas. In particular, two classes of copulas can be built from multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions: extremal mixture copulas and FGM copulas. We analyze the extremal negative dependence structures of copulas corresponding to symmetric Bernoulli vectors with minimal convex sums and explicitly find a class of minimal dependence copulas. Our main results derive from the geometric and algebraic representations of multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions, which effectively encode key statistical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional models pose significant challenges for statistical inference, often requiring regularization to ensure reliable estimation. Traditional penalty-based regularization methods often require specialized algorithms and could be sensitive to violations of underlying assumptions and parameter scaling. To address these issues, we introduce the synthetic-regularized estimator (SRE), a frequentist approach that regularizes the complex target model via a weighted likelihood based on synthetic data generated from a simpler, more stable model. This framework provides a theoretically sound and practically powerful alternative to parameter penalization. We establish theoretical properties of the SRE such as rate optimality in generalized linear models. Using a novel decomposition with the Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem, we derive a precise asymptotic characterization even under non-separable regularization. Building upon these results, we develop practical methodologies for tuning parameter selection, confidence interval construction, and calibrated variable selection in high-dimensional inference. The effectiveness of the SRE is demonstrated through simulation studies and real-data applications.</description>

      <title>A Particle Algorithm for Mean-Field Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals. In this paper, we introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for mean-field variational inference, which we term PArticle VI (PAVI). Notably, our algorithm does not rely on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals, and it applies to the nonparametric setting. We provide non-asymptotic finite-particle convergence guarantee for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Non-Isotropic Random Tensors with Applications to Learning and Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension is an inherent bottleneck to some modern learning tasks, where optimization methods suffer from the size of the data. In this paper, we study non-isotropic distributions of data and develop tools that aim at reducing these dimensional costs by a dependency on an effective dimension rather than the ambient one. Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of ellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a chaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective dimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We show the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning problems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art results in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed optimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for non-smooth optimization. Both applications cover a class of functions that encompasses empirical risk minization (ERM) for linear models.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of Balance: From Information Projections to Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data balancing across multiple modalities and sources appears in various forms in foundation models in machine learning and AI, e.g. in CLIP and DINO. We show that data balancing across modalities and sources actually offers an unsuspected benefit: variance reduction. We present a non-asymptotic statistical bound that quantifies this variance reduction effect and relates it to the eigenvalue decay of Markov operators. Furthermore, we describe how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be better understood, and even improved upon, owing to our variance reduction viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Singular leaning coefficients and efficiency in learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular learning models with non-positive Fisher information matrices include neural networks, reduced-rank regression, Boltzmann machines, normal mixture models, and others. These models have been widely used in the development of learning machines. However, theoretical analysis is still in its early stages. In this paper, we examine learning coefficients, which indicate the general learning efficiency of deep linear learning models and three-layer neural network models with ReLU units. Finally, we extend the results to include the case of the Softmax function.</description>
