      <title>Counting steps for re-stabilization in a labor matching market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-to-one labor matching market. If a worker considers resigning from her current job to obtain a better one, how long does it take for this worker to actually get it? We present an algorithm that models this situation as a re-stabilization process involving a vacancy chain. Each step of the algorithm is a link of such a chain. We show that the length of this vacancy chain, which can be interpreted as the time the worker has to wait for her new job, is intimately connected with the lattice structure of the set of stable matchings of the market. Namely, this length can be computed by considering the cardinalities of cycles in preferences derived from the initial and final stable matchings involved.</description>

      <title>Substitutability, equilibrium transport, and matching models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores the role of substitutability in economic models, particularly in the context of optimal transport and matching models. In equilibrium models with substitutability, market-clearing prices can often be recovered using coordinate update methods such as Jacobi's algorithm. We provide a detailed mathematical analysis of models with substitutability through the lens of Z- and M-functions, in particular regarding their role in ensuring the convergence of Jacobi's algorithm. The chapter proceeds by studying matching models using substitutability, first focusing on models with (imperfectly) transferable utility, and then on models with non-transferable utility. In both cases, the text reviews theoretical implications as well as computational approaches (Sinkhorn, Gale--Shapley), and highlights a practical economic application.</description>

      <title>Buy It Now or Later, or Not: Loss Aversion in Advance Purchasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14929v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the advance-purchase game when a consumer has belief-based loss-averse preferences, introducing a novel perspective by incorporating reference updating. It demonstrates that loss aversion increases the consumer's willingness to pre-purchase. Moreover, the paper endogenizes the seller's price-commitment behavior in the advance-purchase problem. The analysis reveals that the seller will commit to his spot price even with no obligation to do so, a behavior previously assumed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A dual approach to nonparametric characterization for random utility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel characterization for random utility models (RUM), which turns out to be a dual representation of the characterization by Kitamura and Stoye (2018, ECMA). For a given family of budgets and its "patch" representation \'a la Kitamura and Stoye, we construct a matrix $\Xi$ of which each row vector indicates the structure of possible revealed preference relations in each subfamily of budgets. Then, it is shown that a stochastic demand system on the patches of budget lines, say $\pi$, is consistent with a RUM, if and only if $\Xi\pi \geq \mathbb{1}$. In addition to providing a concise quantifier-free characterization, especially when $\pi$ is inconsistent with RUMs, the vector $\Xi\pi$ also contains information concerning (1) sub-families of budgets in which cyclical choices must occur with positive probabilities, and (2) the maximal possible weights on rational choice patterns in a population. The notion of Chv\'atal rank of polytopes and the duality theorem in linear programming play key roles to obtain these results.</description>

      <title>Work Smarter...Not Harder: Efficient Minimization of Dependency Length in SOV Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dependency length minimization is a universally observed quantitative property of natural languages. However, the extent of dependency length minimization, and the cognitive mechanisms through which the language processor achieves this minimization remain unclear. This research offers mechanistic insights by postulating that moving a short preverbal constituent next to the main verb explains preverbal constituent ordering decisions better than global minimization of dependency length in SOV languages. This approach constitutes a least-effort strategy because it's just one operation but simultaneously reduces the length of all preverbal dependencies linked to the main verb. We corroborate this strategy using large-scale corpus evidence across all seven SOV languages that are prominently represented in the Universal Dependency Treebank. These findings align with the concept of bounded rationality, where decision-making is influenced by 'quick-yet-economical' heuristics rather than exhaustive searches for optimal solutions. Overall, this work sheds light on the role of bounded rationality in linguistic decision-making and language evolution.</description>
