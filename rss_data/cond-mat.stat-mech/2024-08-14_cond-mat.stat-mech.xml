      <title>Vacancy diffusion and the hydrodynamics of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of crystals with vacancies is developed on the basis of local-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the chemical potential of vacancies plays a key role together with a constraint relating the concentration of vacancies to the density of mass and the strain tensor. The microscopic foundations are established, leading to Green-Kubo and Einstein-Helfand formulas for the transport coefficients, including the vacancy conductivities and the coefficients of vacancy thermodiffusion. As a consequence of having introduced the chemical potential of vacancies, a relationship is obtained between the conductivities and the Fickian diffusion coefficients for the vacancies. The macroscopic equations are linearized around equilibrium to deduce the dispersion relations of the eight hydrodynamic modes. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the hard-sphere crystal with vacancies. The study explicitly shows that the eighth hydrodynamic mode of nonperfect monatomic crystals is indeed a mode of vacancy diffusion.</description>

      <title>Truncation error in series expansions linking microcanonical and canonical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Critical dimension for hydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits nonequilibrium behaviour with $k^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum, and equilibrium behaviour with $k^{d-1}$ energy spectrum and zero viscosity, where $d$ is the space dimension. Using recursive renormalization group {in Craya-Herring basis}, we show that the nonequilibrium solution is valid only for $d &lt; 6$, whereas equilibrium solution with zero viscosity is the only solution for $d&gt;6$. Thus, $d=6$ is the critical dimension for hydrodynamic turbulence. In addition, we show that the energy flux changes sign from positive to negative near $d=2.15$. We also compute the energy flux and Kolmogorov's constants for various $d$'s, and observe that our results are in good agreement with past numerical results.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Displacement correlations in a two-dimensional colloidal liquid and their relationship with shear strain correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations of the displacement field in a two-dimensional model colloidal liquid is studied numerically and analytically. By calculating the displacement correlations and the shear strain correlations from the numerical data of particle simulations, the displacement field is shown to have nontrivial correlations, even in liquids that are only slightly glassy with the area fraction as low as 0.5. It is suggested analytically and demonstrated numerically that the displacement correlations are more informative than the shear correlations: the former behaves logarithmically with regard to the spatial distance at shorter scales, while the corresponding information is missing from the shear correlations. The logarithmic behavior of the displacement correlations is interpreted as manifesting a long-lived aspect of the cage effect.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Transverse Field Ising Model on the Kagome Lattice using a Programmable Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of competing interactions due to geometry leads to frustration in quantum spin models. As a consequence, the ground state of such systems often displays a large degeneracy that can be lifted due to thermal or quantum effects. One such example is the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the Kagome lattice. It was shown that while the same model on the triangular lattice is ordered at zero temperature for small transverse field due to an order by disorder mechanism, the Kagome lattice resists any such effects and exhibits only short range spin correlations and a trivial paramagnetic phase. We embed this model on the latest architecture of D-Wave's quantum annealer, the Advantage2 prototype, which uses the highly connected Zephyr graph. Using advanced embedding and calibration techniques, we are able to embed a Kagome lattice with mixed open and periodic boundary conditions of 231 sites on the full graph of the currently available prototype. Through forward annealing experiments, we show that under a finite longitudinal field the system exhibits a one-third magnetization plateau, consistent with a classical spin liquid state of reduced entropy. An anneal-pause-quench protocol is then used to extract an experimental ensemble of states resulting from the equilibration of the model at finite transverse and longitudinal field. This allows us to construct a partial phase diagram and confirm that the system exits the constrained Hilbert space of the classical spin liquid when subjected to a transverse field. We connect our results to previous theoretical results and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which helps us confirm the validity of the quantum simulation realized here, thereby extracting insight into the performance of the D-Wave quantum annealer to simulate non-trivial quantum systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Cumulants for Quantum Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that the different phases of entanglement growth are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional positional jumps in stochastic systems with tilted periodic double-well potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the stochastic dynamics of a damped particle in a tilted periodic potential with a double well per period. By applying the matrix continued fraction technique to the Fokker-Planck equation in conjunction with the full counting statistics and master equation approaches, we determine the rates of specific processes contributing to the system's overall dynamics. At low temperatures, the system can exhibit one running state and two distinct locked metastable states. We focus primarily on two aspects: the dynamics of positional jumps, which are rare thermally induced particle jumps over potential maxima, and their impact on the overall velocity noise; and the retrapping process, involving the transition from the running to the locked metastable states. We demonstrate the existence of fractional (in units of $2\pi$) positional slips that differ qualitatively from conventional $2\pi$ jumps observed in single-well systems. Fractional positional slips significantly influence the system dynamics even in regimes dominated by dichotomous-like switching between running and locked states. Furthermore, we introduce a simple master equation approach that proves effective in analyzing various stages of the retrapping process. Interestingly, our analysis shows that even for a system featuring a well-developed double-well periodic potential, there exists a broad parameter range where the stochastic dynamics can be accurately described by an effective single-well periodic model. The techniques introduced here allow for valuable insights into the complex behavior of the system, offering avenues for understanding and controlling its steady-state and transient dynamics, which go beyond or can be complementary to direct stochastic simulations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in long-range quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that of the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium tricritical behaviour in anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarised propagating magnetic field wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave has been extensively investigated by Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Both the effects of the bilinear exchange type and the single site anisotropies are thoroughly investigated. The time average magnetisation (over the complete cycle of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave) components play the role of dynamic order parameter. For fixed set of values of the strength of anisotropy and the field amplitudes, the system has been found to get dynamically ordered at a pseudocritical temperature. The pseudocritical temperature of such dynamic nonequilibrium phase transition has been found to depend on both the strength of anisotropy and the amplitudes of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave. A comprehensive phase diagram is represented here in the form of image plot of the pseudocritical temperature in the plane formed by the strength of anisotropy and field amplitudes. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium phase transition has been found discontinuous (first order) for higher values of the field amplitude and lower values of the anisotropy. On the other hand, the continuous (second order) transition has been noticed for lower values of the field amplitude and higher values of the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>BAD-NEUS: Rapidly converging trajectory stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE as originally formulated and commonly deployed. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an approximate stationary distribution on top of the stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we generalize the NEUS approach in such a way that the approximation error can be reduced systematically. We show that the improved algorithm can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of passive Brownian particles in a fluctuating harmonic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider passive Brownian particles trapped in an "imperfect" harmonic trap. The trap is imperfect because it is randomly turned off and on, and as a result, particles fail to equilibrate. Another way to think about this is to say that a harmonic trap is time-dependent on account of its strength evolving stochastically in time. Particles in such a system are passive and activity arises through external control of a trapping potential, thus, no internal energy is used to power particle motion. A stationary Fokker-Planck equation of this system can be represented as a third-order differential equation, and its solution, a stationary distribution, can be represented as a superposition of Gaussian distributions for different strengths of a harmonic trap. This permits us to interpret a stationary system as a system in equilibrium with quenched disorder.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the observables of the one-dimensional model for anomalous transport in semiconductor devices where diffusion arises from scattering at dislocations at fixed random positions, known as L\'evy-Lorentz gas. To gain insight into the microscopic properties of such a stochastically complex system, deterministic dynamics known as the Slicer Map and Fly-and-Die dynamics are used. We analytically derive the generalized position auto-correlation function of these dynamics and study the special case, the $3$-point position correlation function. For this, we derive single parameter-dependent scaling and compare it with the numerically estimated $3$-point position auto-correlation of the L\'evy-Lorentz gas, for which the analytical expression is still an open question. Here we obtained a remarkable agreement between them, irrespective of any functional relationship with time. Moreover, we demonstrate that the position moments and the position auto-correlations of these systems scale in the same fashion, provided the times are large enough and far enough apart. Other observables, such as velocity moments and correlations, are reported to distinguish the systems.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and locality</title>

Abstract: According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer and subsequent authors who introduced the notion of contour for long-range systems, we provide a definition of contour and a direct proof for the phase transition for ferromagnetic long-range Ising models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. The argument, which is based on a multi-scale analysis, works for the sharp region $\alpha&gt;d$ and improves previous results obtained by Park for $\alpha&gt;3d+1$, and by Ginibre, Grossmann, and Ruelle for $\alpha&gt; d+1$, where $\alpha$ is the power of the coupling constant. The key idea is to avoid a large number of small contours. As an application, we prove the persistence of the phase transition when we add a polynomially decaying magnetic field with power $\delta&gt;0$ as $h^*|x|^{-\delta}$, where $h^* &gt;0$. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+1$, the phase transition occurs when $\delta&gt;\alpha-d$, and when $h^*$ is small enough over the critical line $\delta=\alpha-d$. For $\alpha \geq d+1$, $\delta&gt;1$ is enough to prove the phase transition, and for $\delta=1$ we have to ask $h^*$ small. The natural conjecture is that this region is also sharp for the phase transition problem when we have a decaying field.</description>

      <title>Recovering complete positivity of non-Markovian quantum dynamics with Choi-proximity regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relevant problem in the theory of open quantum systems is the lack of complete positivity of dynamical maps obtained after weak-coupling approximations, a famous example being the Redfield master equation. A number of approaches exist to recover well-defined evolutions under additional Markovian assumptions, but much less is known beyond this regime. Here we propose a numerical method to cure the complete-positivity violation issue while preserving the non-Markovian features of an arbitrary original dynamical map. The idea is to replace its unphysical Choi operator with its closest physical one, mimicking recent work on quantum process tomography. We also show that the regularized dynamics is more accurate in terms of reproducing the exact dynamics: this allows to heuristically push the utilization of these master equations in moderate coupling regimes, where the loss of positivity can have relevant impact.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality under imperfect teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wavefunction transfer under imperfect teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wavefunction, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection $(i)$ preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, $(ii)$ weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and $(iii)$ obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a `built-in' decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors -- highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally encode aspects of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purification maps a mixed state to a pure state and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, reminiscent of the quantum speed limit, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>
