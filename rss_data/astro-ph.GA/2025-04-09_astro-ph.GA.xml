      <title>The distribution of lenticular galaxies in the phase space of present-day galaxy cluster regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental impact of cluster regions on the evolution of nearby S0 galaxies, focusing on their distinct quiescent and star-forming (SF) subpopulations. We select a sample of clusters by crossmatching optical and X-ray data and extract a subset of 14 systems with maximally relaxed cores by applying strict virialization and substructure tests. A projected phase space (PPS) diagram is generated from the stack of relaxed clusters up to 3 virial radii to assess the locations of quiescent and SF S0s and their cluster infall histories. Additionally, we compare the radial line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VDLOS) and specific star-formation rate (SSFR) profiles for the different S0 subpopulations, using other Hubble types as benchmarks. Our study shows that quiescent S0s, the dominant class in the entire cluster region, concentrate preferentially at low radii in the PPS diagram, while SF S0s are more abundant in the outskirts. Despite this segregation, both subpopulations show similar VDLOS profiles in the cluster core -indicating an advanced stage of dynamical relaxation-, but that resemble those of late-type galaxies beyond the virial radius. This finding, combined with the distinct PPS distributions of both S0 subpopulations, which lead to mean infall times $\sim 1$ Gyr longer for quiescent S0s but that are shorter than those expected for ancient infallers, suggests that a substantial fraction of S0s present in the core region arrive via secondary infall. We also find evidence in the SSFR profiles that star formation in S0s begins to decline beyond the virialized core, likely due to preprocessing in infalling groups. Our results support a delayed-then-rapid quenching scenario for SF S0s in cluster regions, where their centrally concentrated star formation persists for an extended period before abruptly ending ($\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr) after their first pericenter passage.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Disk Thickness in M51 from H-alpha, Pa-alpha, and Mid-Infrared Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05430v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.</description>

      <title>Recent star formation in 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5 quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05511v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of massive, quiescent galaxies reveal a relatively uniform evolution: following prolific star formation in the early universe, these galaxies quench and transition to their characteristic quiescent state in the local universe. The debate on the relative role and frequency of the process(es) driving this evolution is robust. In this letter, we identify 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5 massive, quiescent galaxies in the HST/UVCANDELS extragalactic deep fields using traditional color selection methods and model their spectral energy distributions, which incorporates novel UV images. This analysis reveals ~15% of massive, quiescent galaxies have experienced minor, recent star formation(&lt;10% of total stellar mass within the past ~1Gyr). We find only a marginal, positive correlation between the probability for recent star formation and a measure of the richness of the local environment from a statistical analysis. Assuming the recent star formation present in these quiescent galaxies is physically linked to the local environment, these results suggest only a minor role for dynamic external processes (galaxy mergers and interactions) in the formation and evolution of these galaxies at this redshift.</description>

      <title>Periodic variations of the first and second moments of broad Balmer emission lines from central accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disks has been widely accepted to explain the unique double-peaked broad emission lines in Active Galactic Nuclei (double-peaked BLAGNs). Here, accepted the accretion disk origin, periodic variations of central wavelength $\lambda_{0}$ (the first moment) and line width $\sigma$ (the second moment) of double-peaked broad emission lines are theoretically simulated and determined. Furthermore, through theoretically simulated periodicities of $T_{\lambda0}$ and $T_{\sigma}$ for variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$, periodicity ratio $R_{fs}$ of $T_{\lambda0}$ to $T_{\sigma}$ to be around 2 can be applied to support the spiral arms to be more preferred in BLRs lying into central accretion disks. Then, periodic variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$ are determined and shown in the known double-peaked BLAGN NGC1097, leading to the parameter $R_{fs}\sim2$, which can be applied as clues to support that the structure of spiral arms in disk-like BLRs in central accretion disk should be the most compelling interpretation to the variability of double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ in NGC1097. The results provide clean criteria to test accretion disk origins of double-peaked broad emission lines in AGN.</description>

      <title>A Redshift Survey of the Coma Cluster (A1656): Understanding the Nature of Subhalos in the Weak-lensing Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the physical properties of weak-lensing subhalos in the Coma cluster of galaxies using data from galaxy redshift surveys. The data include 12989 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (2184 from our MMT/Hectospec observation and 10807 from the literature). The $r$-band magnitude limit at which the differential spectroscopic completeness drops below 50% is 20.2 mag, which is spatially uniform in a region of 4.5 deg$^{2}$ where the weak-lensing map of Okabe et al. (2014) exists. We identify 1337 member galaxies in this field and use them to understand the nature of 32 subhalos detected in the weak-lensing analysis. We use Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) in the line-of-sight velocity domain to measure the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion, and the number of subhalo galaxies by mitigating the contamination from the interloping galaxies. Using subhalo properties calculated with GMM, we find no significant difference in the redshift space distribution between the cluster member galaxies and subhalos. We find that the weak-lensing mass shows strong correlations with the number of subhalo member galaxies, velocity dispersion, and dynamical mass of subhalos with power-law slopes of $0.54^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $0.93^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, and $0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$, respectively. The slope of the mass--velocity dispersion relation of the weak-lensing subhalos appears shallower than that of the galaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and individual galaxies. These results suggest that the combination of redshift surveys with weak-lensing maps can be a powerful tool for better understanding the nature of subhalos in clusters.</description>

      <title>PASSAGES: The Discovery of a Strongly Lensed Protocluster Core Candidate at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the processes by which galaxies rapidly build up their stellar mass during the peak of their star formation ($z=2$--$3$) is crucial to advancing our understanding of the assembly of large-scale structures. We report the discovery of one of the most gas- and dust-rich protocluster core candidates, PJ0846+15 (J0846), from the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) sample. The exceedingly high total apparent star formation rate of up to ($\mu$SFR) $\sim 93600\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ is a result of a foreground cluster lens magnifying at least 11 dusty star-forming galaxies between $z=2.660$--$2.669$. Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations revealed 18 CO(3--2) emission-line detections, some of which are multiply-imaged systems, lensed by a foreground cluster at $z=0.77$. We present the first multi-wavelength characterization of this field, constructing a lens model that predicts that these 11 systems (magnification factor, $\mu\simeq1.5$--$25$) are contained within a projected physical extent of $280\times150$ kpc, with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v}=246\pm72$ km s$^{-1}$ and a total intrinsic star formation rate of up to (SFR) $\sim10400\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$. J0846 is one of the most unique, lensed, protocluster core candidates ever reported, and offers a magnified glimpse into the rapid buildup of massive local galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A Study of Multiple Molecular Lines at the 3 mm Band toward Gas Infalling Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of multiple molecular spectral lines in gas infalling sources can provide the physical and chemical properties of these sources and help us estimate their evolutionary stages. We report line detections within the 3 mm band using the FTS wide-sideband mode of the IRAM 30 m telescope toward 20 gas-infalling sources. Using XCLASS, we identify the emission lines of up to 22 molecular species (including a few isotopologues) and one hydrogen radio recombination line in these sources. H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CCH lines are detected in 15 sources. We estimate the rotation temperatures and column densities of these molecular species using the LTE radiative transfer model, and compare the molecular abundances of these sources with those from nine high-mass star-forming regions reported in previous studies and with those from the chemical model. Our results suggest that G012.79-0.20, G012.87-0.22 clump A and B, and G012.96-0.23 clump A may be in the high-mass protostellar object stage, while sources with fewer detected species may be in the earlier evolutionary stage. Additionally, the CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ column densities in our sources reveal a linear correlation, with a ratio of N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) = 89.2$\pm$5.6, which is higher than the ratios reported in the literature. When considering only sources with lower column densities, this ratio decreases to 29.0$\pm$6.1, consistent with those of diffuse clouds. Furthermore, a comparison between the N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) ratio and the sources' physical parameters reveals a correlation, with sources exhibiting higher ratios tending to have higher kinetic temperatures and H$_2$ column densities.</description>

      <title>Accurate Decomposition of Galaxies with Spiral Arms: Dust Properties and Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze three nearby spiral galaxies - NGC 1097, NGC 1566, and NGC 3627 - using images from the DustPedia database in seven infrared bands (3.6, 8, 24, 70, 100, 160, and 250 micron). For each image, we perform photometric decomposition and construct a multi-component model, including a detailed representation of the spiral arms. Our results show that the light distribution is well described by an exponential disk and a Sersic bulge when non-axisymmetric components are properly taken into account. We test the predictions of the stationary density wave theory using the derived models in bands, tracing both old stars and recent star formation. Our findings suggest that the spiral arms in all three galaxies are unlikely to originate from stationary density waves. Additionally, we perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE, fitting individual components to derive dust properties. We find that spiral arms contain a significant (&gt;10%) fraction of cold dust, with an average temperature of approximately 18-20 K. The estimated fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) declines significantly toward the galactic center but remains similar between the arm and interarm regions.</description>

      <title>Pushing JWST to the extremes: search and scrutiny of bright galaxy candidates at z$\simeq$15-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges $15 \leq z \leq 20$ and $20 \leq z \leq 28$. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of $\sim0.2$ sq. deg. We identify nine candidates at $15 \leq z \leq 20$, while no objects are found based on the $z\gtrsim20$ color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a $&gt;$1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\sim$3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently acquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to be a dusty ($E(B-V)=0.8$ mag) starburst galaxy at $z=6.56$. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at $z\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at $z&lt;15$, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\text{UV}}&lt;-21$) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select $M_{\text{UV}}\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z&gt;15$. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\lesssim$8.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXIII. The powering mechanisms of the Ly$\alpha$ haloes around high-$z$ quasars probed by slit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of Ly$\alpha$ haloes around faint quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$. We use 20 and 162 quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$, taken by slit spectroscopy, and detect Ly$\alpha$ haloes around 12 and 26 of these quasars, respectively. The average absolute magnitudes of the detected quasars are $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.84$ mag at $z\sim4$ and $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.68$ mag at $z\sim6$, which are comparable at $z\sim4$ and 3 mag fainter at $z\sim6$ than those of previous studies. The median surface brightness profiles are found to be consistent with an exponential curve, showing a hint of flattening within a radius of 5 kpc. The Ly$\alpha$ haloes around these faint quasars are systematically fainter than those around bright quasars in the previous studies. We confirm the previous results that the Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity depends on both the ionizing and Ly$\alpha$ peak luminosities of quasars at $z\sim4$, and also find that a similar correlation holds even at $z\sim6$. While the observed Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity is overall attributed to recombination emission from the optically thin gas clouds in the CGM, its luminosity dependences can be consistently explained by the partial contributions of recombination radiation from the optically thick clouds, which is thought to originate from the CGM centre, and the scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons, which is resonantly trapped at the CGM centre and escaping outside of the haloes.</description>

      <title>Distance to M87 as the Mode of the Modulus Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: de Grijs and Bono (ApJS 2020, 246, 3) compiled a list of distances to M87 from the literature published in the last 100 years. They reported the arithmetic mean of the three most stable tracers (Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations). The arithmetic mean is one of the measures of central tendency of a distribution; others are the median and mode. The three do not align for asymmetric distributions, which is the case for the distance moduli $\mu_0$ to M87. I construct a kernel density distribution of the set of $\mu_0$ and estimate the recommended distance to M87 as its mode, obtaining $\mu_0 = \left(31.06~\pm~0.001\,\textrm{(statistical)}\,^{+0.04}_{-0.06}\,\textrm{(systematic)}\right)$~mag, corresponding to \linebreak $D=16.29^{+0.30}_{-0.45}$~Mpc, which yields uncertainties smaller than those associated with the mean and median.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the high state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find that, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the short time scale for the state transition.</description>

      <title>Investigating Embedded Structures and Gas Kinematics in the IRDC Hosting Bubble N59-North</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of an extended area hosting the bubble N59-North to explore the physical processes driving massive star formation (MSF). The Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image reveals an elongated/filamentary infrared-dark cloud (length $\sim$28 pc) associated with N59-North, which contains several protostars and seven ATLASGAL dust clumps at the same distance. The existence of this filament is confirmed through $^{13}$CO and NH$_3$ molecular line data in a velocity range of [95, 106] km s$^{-1}$. All dust clumps satisfy Kauffmann &amp; Pillai's condition for MSF. Using Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image, a new embedded hub-filament system candidate (C-HFS) is investigated toward the ATLASGAL clump, located near the filament's central region. MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission, detected for the first time toward C-HFS, reveals an ultracompact HII region driven by a B2-type star, suggesting an early stage of HFS with minimal feedback from the young massive star. The comparison of the position-velocity (PV) and position-position-velocity (PPV) diagrams with existing theoretical models suggests that rotation, central collapse, and end-dominated collapse are not responsible for the observed gas motion in the filament. The PPV diagram indicates the expansion of N59-North by revealing blue- and red-shifted gas velocities at the edge of the bubble. Based on comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, this study suggests that cloud-cloud collision (CCC) led to the formation of the filament, likely giving it a conical structure with gas converging toward its central region, where C-HFS is located. Overall, the study supports multi-scale filamentary mass accretion for MSF, likely triggered by CCC.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/upGREAT imaging spectroscopy of the [C II] 158 um fine structure line toward the Sgr A region in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SOFIA/upGREAT velocity-resolved spectral imaging and analysis of the 158 um [C II] spectral line toward the central 80 by 43\,pc region of the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. The field we imaged with 14" (0.6 pc) spatial and 1 km/s spectral resolution contains the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND) around the central black hole Sgr A*, the neighboring thermal Arched Filaments, the nonthermal filaments of the Radio Arc, and the three luminous central star clusters. [C II] traces emission from the CND's inner edge to material orbiting at a distance of approximately 6 pc. Its velocity field reveals no sign of inflowing material nor interaction with winds from the Sgr A East supernova remnant. Wide-field imaging of the Sgr A region shows multiple circular segments, including the thermal Arched Filaments, that are centered on a region that includes the Quintuplet cluster. We examine the possibility that the Arched Filaments and other large-scale arcs trace transient excitation events from supernova blast waves. Along the Arched Filaments, comparisons among far-IR fine structure lines show changes in ionization state over small scales and that high-excitation lines are systematically shifted in position from the other lines. These also point to transient fast winds that shocked on the surface of the Arches cloud to produce additional local UV radiation to excite the Arched Filaments on a cloud surface illuminated by UV from hot stars.</description>

      <title>The Resolved Structure of a Low Metallicity Photodissociation Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper in the PDR compared to the H/H2 transition in low-metallicity environments, increasing the extent of CO-dark H2 gas. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution observations tracing H2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of H2 vibrational lines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 +- 0.013(stat.) +- 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0."146 +- 0."042 (stat.) +- 0."012 (syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Infrared Background Tomography and a Census of Cosmic Dust and Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) encodes dust emission from all galaxies and carries valuable information on structure formation, star formation, and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. However, its redshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight projection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared intensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and IRAS, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from SDSS I-IV tomographically. We mitigate foregrounds using CSFD, a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These cross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB redshift distributions and collectively yield a $60\sigma$ detection of the evolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. We break the bias-intensity degeneracy by adding monopole information from FIRAS. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust temperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host environments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we constrain cosmic dust density, $\Omega_{\rm dust}$, which peaks at $z = 1$-$1.5$ and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage enables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex precision, tracing star-formation history with negligible cosmic variance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80% dust-obscured at $z = 0$ and 60% at $z = 4$. Our results, based on intensity mapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or low-surface-brightness components. We release our tomographic CIB spectrum and redshift distributions as a public resource for future studies of the CIB, both as a cosmological matter tracer and CMB foreground.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), produced by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), offers a unique probe of their cosmic evolution. Using our recently proposed technique, we investigate the prospect of discovering the SMBHB population and its evolution by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy observation by exploring their cross-correlation. Using a Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that the SGWB power spectrum alone can provide only a weak measurement of the cosmic genealogy of SMBHBs, while the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution can significantly improve our measurement and open a discovery space. With a PTA of 2000 pulsars, achievable in the SKA era, we find that the redshift evolution of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and galaxy stellar mass can be measured with an SNR up to 4 in the redshift range up to three. The frequency distribution can be constrained with an SNR of approximately up to 80 in the same redshift range at a frequency range accessible from nHz. These SNRs improve further with the increase in the number of pulsars to 5000 expected from SKA. This demonstrates the prospect of answering the decades-long unsolved problem of SMBH growth and evolution over cosmic time and shedding new insights on the standard model of cosmology using synergy between nHz GW and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Study of the Dynamic Environment surrounding the FUor V960 Mon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.</description>

      <title>The UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Large Director's Discretionary Program with Hubble. I. Goals, Design, and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.</description>

      <title>A mass invariant in a compressible turbulent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the measurable statistical properties of density fluctuations in a supersonic compressible turbulent flow is a major challenge in physics. In 1951, Chandrasekhar derived an invariant under the assumption of the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulent density field and stationarity of the background density. Recently, Jaupart &amp; Chabrier (2021) extended this invariant to non-isotropic flows in a time-evolving background and showed that it has the dimension of a mass. This invariant $M_{\rm inv}$ is defined by $M_{\rm inv} = \mathbb{E}(\rho)\text{Var}\left(\frac{\rho}{\mathbb{E}(\rho)}\right)(l_{\rm c}^\rho)^3$ where $\rho$ is the density field and $l_{\rm c}^\rho$ is the correlation length. In this article, we perform numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic compressible turbulence to test the validity of this invariant in a medium subject to isotropic decaying turbulence. We study several input configurations, namely different Mach numbers, injection lengths of turbulence and equations of state. We confirm that $M_{\rm inv}$ remains constant during the decaying phase of turbulence. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical model of the density field statistics which predicts without any free parameter the evolution of the correlation length with the variance of the logdensity field beyond the assumption of the gaussian field for the logdensity. Noting that $M_{\rm inv}$ is independent of the Mach number, we show that this invariant can be used to relate the non-gaussian evolution of the logdensity probability distribution function to its variance with no free parameters.</description>

      <title>Rotationally Driven Ultraviolet Emission of Red Giant Stars II. Metallicity, Activity, Binarity and Sub-subgiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars are overwhelmingly observed to rotate very slowly compared to main-sequence stars, but a few percent of them show rapid rotation and high activity, often as a result of tidal synchronizationn or other angular momentum transfer events. In this paper we build upon previous work using a sample of 7,286 RGB stars from APOGEE DR17 with measurable rotation. We derive an updated NUV excess vs $v \sin{i}$ rotation-activity relation that is consistent with our previous published version, but reduces uncertainty through the inclusion of a linear [M/H] correction term. We find that both single stars and binary stars generally follow our rotation-activity relation, but single stars seemingly saturate at $P_{\text{rot}}$/$\sin{i}$ $\sim$10 days while binary stars show no sign of saturation, suggesting they are able to carry substantially stronger magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) to be the most active giant binaries, with rotation synchronized to orbits with periods $\lesssim$ 20 days. Given their unusually high level of activity compared to other short-period synchronized giants we suspect the SSGs are most commonly overactive RS CVn stars. Using estimates of critical rotation we identify a handful giants rotating near break-up and determine tidal spin up to this level of rotation is highly unlikely and instead suggest planetary engulfment or stellar mergers in a fashion generally proposed for FK Comae stars.</description>

      <title>On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black hole in OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully monitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a period of $\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine description for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMBH, to explain the {\it observed} decay of SMBH binary orbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements, and OJ~287's orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH binary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced dynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper bound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally derived value, as argued by \cite{Chan2024}.</description>

      <title>Fluorine abundances in CEMP stars at the lowest metallicity: Hints on the nature of the first stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the available measurements of fluorine abundance have increased significantly, providing additional information on the chemical evolution of our Galaxy and details on complex stellar nucleosynthesis processes. However, the observational challenges to obtain stellar F abundances favor samples with higher metallicities, resulting in a scarcity of measurements at low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt;-2.0$). We present F abundances and upper limits in 7 carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars observed with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), at the Gemini-South telescope. These new observations delivered high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, infrared spectra allowing us to probe significantly deeper into the metal-poor regime and the cosmic origin of F. This work presents the results of our observations, including two 2-sigma detections and five upper limits in a variety of CEMP stars. Arguably the most important result is for CS 29498-0043, a CEMP-no star at [Fe/H] = $-3.87$ with a F detection of [F/Fe] = $+2.0\pm 0.4$, the lowest metallicity star (more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than the next detection) with observed F abundance to date. This measurement allowed us to differentiate between two zero metallicity Population III (Pop III) progenitors: one involving He-burning with primary N in Wolf-Rayet stars, and the other suggesting H-burning during hypernova explosions. Our measured value is in better agreement with the latter scenario. This detection represents a pilot, and pioneering study demonstrating the power of F to explore the nature and properties of the first chemical enrichment from Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>A deep search for Complex Organic Molecules toward the protoplanetary disk of V883 Ori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.</description>

      <title>NQG III -- Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the hunt for WIMPish dark matter and testing our new theory, we extend the results obtained for the Kepler problem in NQG I and NQG II to the Euler two-centre problem and to other classical Hamiltonian systems with planar periodic orbits. In the first case our results lead to quantum elliptical spirals converging to elliptical orbits where stars and other celestial bodies can form as the corresponding WIMP/molecular clouds condense. The examples inevitably involve elliptic integrals as was the case in our earlier work on equatorial orbits of toy neutron stars (see Ref. [27]). Hence this is the example on which we focus in this work on quantisation. The main part of our analysis which leans heavily on Hamilton-Jacobi theory is applicable to any KLMN integrable planar periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems. The most useful results on Weierstrass elliptic functions needed in these two works we have summarised with complete proofs in the appendix. This has been one of the most enjoyable parts of this research understanding in more detail the genius of Weierstrass and Jacobi. However we have to say that the beautiful simplicity of the Euler two-centre results herein transcend even this as far as we are concerned. At the end of the paper we see how the Burgers-Zeldovich fluid model relates to our set-up through Nelson's stochastic mechanics.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the [CII] luminosity function from the power spectrum of line intensity maps at redshift 3.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the line-intensity-mapping power spectrum (PS) are expected to set precious constraints on several quantities of astrophysical and cosmological interest. Our study targets the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which is still highly uncertain, in particular at the faint end. As an example of future opportunities, we present forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) that will be conducted with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope at $z \simeq 3.6$ and also make predictions for eventual $10\times$ wider and/or $\sqrt{10}\times$ more sensitive surveys. The halo-occupation properties of [CII] emitters in the MARIGOLD simulations provide us with the motivation to abundance match two versions of the ALPINE LF against the halo mass function. We employ the resulting luminosity-mass relation within the halo model to predict the expected PS signal and its uncertainty. Finally, we use Bayesian inference to analyse mock PS data and forecast what constraints could be achieved on the first two moments of the LF and on Schechter fits. Depending on the actual LF, the DSS will measure the clustering and shot-noise amplitudes of the PS with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 3$ or higher. However, degeneracies with the bias parameter and redshift-space distortions make it unfeasible to extract the first moment of the LF. Even the widest and most sensitive survey we consider can only constrain it with a $50\%$ uncertainty. By jointly fitting the PS and the LF, we directly constrain Schechter-function parameters. We find that the normalisation and the cutoff luminosity are precisely and accurately measured while the faint-end slope remains highly uncertain (unless the true value approaches $-2$). Overall, increasing the survey sensitivity at fixed sky coverage yields greater improvements than covering a larger area at fixed sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Molecular Hydrogen Cooling on the Galaxy Formation Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of molecular (${\rm H_2}$) and atomic (HI) hydrogen cooling on the galaxy formation threshold. We calculate the fraction of dark matter (DM) halos that exceeds a critical mass required for star formation, $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, as a function of their peak mass. By convolving analytic halo mass accretion histories (MAHs) with models for $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, we predict that halos with peak virial masses below $\sim 10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ can form stars before reionization through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. These halos remain dark when only HI cooling and reionization are modeled. However, less than $\approx 10\%$ of halos with peak masses below $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ ever exceed $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, even when ${\rm H_2}$ cooling is included; this threshold is primarily set by relative streaming motion between DM and baryons imprinted at recombination. We obtain similar results using subhalo MAHs from an extremely high-resolution cosmological DM--only zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way (MW) analog (particle mass $6.3\times 10^3~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Based on the abundance of MW satellites, these results imply that at least some known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies formed through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. This work sharpens predictions for the galaxy formation threshold and demonstrates how its essential features emerge from the underlying distribution of halo growth histories.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric accretion through a streamer onto the pre-stellar core H-MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CONTEXT: Dense cores are thought to be isolated from the surrounding cloud. However, observations of streamers and subsonic material outside core boundaries challenges this idea. AIMS: In this study, we aim to probe the extended subsonic region observed around the pre-stellar core H-MM1 in L1688 using multi-component kinematical analysis of very high-sensitivity NH3 data. METHODS: We used observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) using GBT. We then fitted up to two components towards the core and its surrounding molecular cloud. RESULTS: We detect an extended region of subsonic turbulence in addition to the ambient cloud, which show supersonic turbulence. This extended subsonic region is approximately 12 times the size of and more than two times as massive as the previously detected subsonic material. The subsonic region is further split into two well-separated, velocity-coherent components, one of which is kinematically and spatially connected to the dense core. The two subsonic components are red- and blue-shifted with respected to the cloud component. We also detect a flow of material onto the dense core from the extended subsonic region via a streamer of length ~0.15 pc (~30000 au). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the extended subsonic component kinematically associated with the dense core contains 27% more mass than the core. This material could be further accreted by the core. The other subsonic component contains a mass similar to that of the core mass, and could be tracing material in the early stage of core formation. The H-MM1 streamer is kinematically similar to the ones observed towards protostellar systems, but is the first instance of such an accretion feature onto a core in its pre-stellar phase. This accretion of chemically fresh material by the pre-stellar core challenges our current understanding of a core evolving with a mass unchanged since the time of its formation.</description>

      <title>The Galactic-Centre Arms inferred from ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on observing unstudied Galactic open clusters in the Ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range and analyzing their photometric data. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) enables us to precisely study known Galactic open clusters. We conducted observations using the 1.54-meter Danish Telescope (DK1.54) in Chile and the 2.15-meter telescope at the Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina, employing UV filters. Furthermore, we have collected available photometric and astrometric data for our observed clusters. We aim to estimate the reddening of Galactic open clusters using UV photometry. We applied isochrone fitting to determine the reddening of the clusters using well-known members. As a final result, we present the reddening values of 105 Galactic open clusters in the UV, as determined by our photometry.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of Cosmic Birefringence Using Galaxy Polarization and Shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel statistical method to measure cosmic birefringence and demonstrate its power in probing parity violation due to axions. Exploiting an empirical correlation between the integrated radio polarization direction of a spiral galaxy and its apparent shape, we devise an unbiased minimum-variance estimator for the rotation angle, which should achieve an uncertainty of $5^\circ$--$ 15^\circ$ per galaxy. Large galaxy samples from the forthcoming SKA continuum surveys, together with optical shape catalogs, promise a comparable or even lower noise power spectrum for the rotation angle than in the CMB Stage-IV (CMB-S4) experiment, with different systematics.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO Filter Profile Service and photometric tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03310v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>

Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing wider hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This choice is particularly relevant for use cases in astrophysics and engineering -- specifically those in which particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales -- where bespoke choices of unequal particle masses in the initial conditions cannot easily be used to address emergent and evolving density discontinuities. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art SWIFT code and is designed with computational efficiency also in mind, meaning that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without prohibitive cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>Supernovae at Distances &lt; 40 Mpc: II. Supernova Rate in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04507</link>

Abstract: Context.This is the second paper of a series aiming to determine the birth rates of supernovae in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to estimate the SN rates in the local universe and fit the delay-time distribution of SNe Ia to put constraints on their progenitor scenarios. Methods.We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the volumetric rates with the nearby SN sample introduced in Paper I of the series. The rate evolution of core-collapse SNe well traces the evolution of cosmic star formation history; while that of SNe Ia involves the convolution of cosmic star-formation history and a two-component delay-time distribution including a power law and a Gaussian component. Results.The volumetric rates of type Ia, Ibc and II SNe are derived as $0.325\pm0.040^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$, $0.160\pm0.028^{+0.044}_{-0.014}$, and $0.528\pm0.051^{+0.162}_{-0.013}$ (in unit of $10^{-4} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} h^3_{70}$), respectively. The rate of CCSNe is consistent with previous estimates. The newly derived local SN Ia rate is larger than existing results given at redshifts 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1, favoring an increased rate from the universe at z ~ 0.1 to the local universe. A two-component model can well fit the rate variation, with the power law component accounting for the rate evolution at larger redshifts and the Gaussian component with a delay time of 12.63$\pm$0.38 Gyr accounting for the local rate evolution. This delayed component with such a longer delay time suggests that the progenitors of these SNe Ia were formed at around 1 Gyr after the birth of the universe, which could only be explained by a double-degenerate progenitor scenario. This is evidenced by the comparison with the PTF sample of SNe Ia at z = 0.073, which reveals that the increase in SN Ia rate at z &lt; 0.01 is primarily due to the SNe Ia of massive E and S0 galaxies with old stellar populations.</description>
