      <title>The Plain Sphere Number of a Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a link in $S^3$. We consider the class of meridional presentations for $\pi_1(S^3\backslash L)$ in which the relations are witnessed by embedded two-spheres which are in plain sight in a fixed diagram of $L$. The Wirtinger presentation is a special case. We prove that the bridge number of $L$ equals the smallest number of generators of $\pi_1(S^3\backslash L)$ over all such presentations.</description>

      <title>On the topology of $B\Gamma_n^\mathbb{C}$ and its application to complex structures on open manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, it has been known that any open connected manifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6 admits a complex analytic structure whenever its tangent bundle admits a complex linear structure. For half a century, this has been conjectured to hold true for manifolds of any dimension. In this paper, we extend the result to manifolds of dimension 8 and 10.
  The result is proved by applying Gromov's h-principle in order to adapt a method of Haefliger, originally used to study foliations, to the holomorphic setting. For dimension 12 and greater, the conjecture remains open.</description>

Abstract: We study the large $r$ asymptotic behaviour of the Turaev-Viro invariants of oriented Seifert fibered 3-manifolds at the root $q=e^\frac{2\pi i}{r}$. As an application, we prove the volume conjecture for large families of oriented Seifert fibered 3-manifolds with empty and non-empty boundary.</description>

      <title>Multiple points of view: The simultaneous crossing number for knots with doubly transvergent diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous crossing number is a new knot invariant which is defined for strongly invertible knots having diagrams with two orthogonal transvergent axes of strong inversions. Because the composition of the two inversions gives a cyclic period of order 2 with an axis orthogonal to the two axes of strong inversion, knot diagrams with this property have three characteristic orthogonal directions. We define the simultaneous crossing number, $\operatorname{sim}(K)$, as the minimum of the sum of the numbers of crossings of projections in the 3 directions, where the minimum is taken over all embeddings of $K$ satisfying the symmetry condition. Dividing the simultaneous crossing number by the usual crossing number, $\operatorname{cr}(K)$, of a knot gives a number $\ge 3$, because each of the 3 diagrams is a knot diagram of the knot in question. We show that $\liminf_{\operatorname{cr}(K) \to \infty} \operatorname{sim}(K)/\operatorname{cr}(K) \le 8$, when the minimum over all knots and the limit over increasing crossing numbers is considered.</description>

      <title>Simplicial volume of open books in dimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we adapt a proof by Bucher and Neofytidis to prove that the simplicial volume of 4-manifolds admitting an open book decomposition vanishes. In particular this shows that Quinns signature invariant, which detects the existence of an open book decomposition in dimensions above 4, is insufficient to characterize open books in dimension 4, even if one allows arbitrary stabilizations via connected sums.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Blow-Ups of Weighted Building Sets and Configuration Spaces of Filtered Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fulton and MacPherson famously constructed a configuration space that encodes infinitesimal collision data by blowing up the diagonals. We observe that when generalizing their approach to configuration spaces of filtered manifolds (e.g. jet spaces or sub-Riemannian manifolds), these blow-ups have to be modified with weights in order for the collisions to be compatible with higher-order data.
  In the present article, we provide a general framework for blowing up arrangements of submanifolds that are equipped with a weighting in the sense of Loizides and Meinrenken. We prove in particular smoothness of the blow-up under reasonable assumptions, extending a result of Li to the weighted setting. Our discussion covers both spherical and projective blow-ups, as well as the (restricted) functoriality of the construction.
  Alongside a self-contained introduction to weightings, we also give a new characterization thereof in terms of their vanishing ideals and prove that cleanly intersecting weightings locally yield a weighting.
  As our main application, we construct configuration spaces of filtered manifolds, including convenient local models. We also discuss a variation of the construction tailored to certain fiber bundles equipped with a filtration. This is necessary for the special case of jet configuration spaces, which we investigate in a future article.</description>

      <title>Braiding vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vineyards are a common way to study persistence diagrams of a data set which is changing, as strong stability means that it is possible to pair points in ``nearby'' persistence diagrams, yielding a family of point sets which connect into curves when stacked. Recent work has also studied monodromy in the persistent homology transform, demonstrating some interesting connections between an input shape and monodromy in the persistent homology transform for 0-dimensional homology embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this work, we re-characterize monodromy in terms of periodicity of the associated vineyard of persistence diagrams.
  We construct a family of objects in any dimension which have non-trivial monodromy for $l$-persistence of any periodicity and for any $l$. More generally we prove that any knot or link can appear as a vineyard for a shape in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq 3$. This shows an intriguing and, to the best of our knowledge, previously unknown connection between knots and persistence vineyards. In particular this shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as one could possibly hope.</description>

      <title>Connecting 3-manifold triangulations with unimodal sequences of elementary moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key result in computational 3-manifold topology is that any two triangulations of the same 3-manifold are connected by a finite sequence of bistellar flips, also known as Pachner moves. One limitation of this result is that little is known about the structure of this sequence; knowing more about the structure could help both proofs and algorithms. Motivated by this, we consider sequences of moves that are "unimodal" in the sense that they break up into two parts: first, a sequence that monotonically increases the size of the triangulation; and second, a sequence that monotonically decreases the size. We prove that any two one-vertex triangulations of the same 3-manifold, each with at least two tetrahedra, are connected by a unimodal sequence of 2-3 and 2-0 moves. We also study the practical utility of unimodal sequences; specifically, we implement an algorithm to find such sequences, and use this algorithm to perform some detailed computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-complex cobordisms between quasipositive knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every genus $g \geq 0$, there exist quasipositive knots $K_0^g$ and $K_1^g$ such that there is a cobordism of genus $g=|g_4(K_1^g)-g_4(K_0^g)|$ between $K_0^g$ and $K_1^g$, but there is no ribbon cobordism of genus $g$ in either direction and thus no complex cobordism between these two knots. This gives a negative answer to a question posed by Feller in 2016.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the free factor complex of the free group of rank greater than or equal to 4 does not satisfy a combinatorial isoperimetric inequality: that is, for every natural number N, there is a loop c_N of length 4 in the free factor complex such that the number of 2-simplices required to fill c_N grows at least as a linear function of N. To prove the result, we construct a coarsely Lipschitz function from the `upward link' of a free factor to the set of integers.</description>

      <title>Contact non-squeezing at large scale via generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using SFT techniques, Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich (2006) proved that if $\pi R_2^2 \leq K \leq \pi R_1^2$ for some integer $K$ then there is no contact squeezing in $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ of the prequantization of the ball of radius $R_1$ into the prequantization of the ball of radius $R_2$. This result was extended to the case of balls of radius $R_1$ and $R_2$ with $1 \leq \pi R_2^2 \leq \pi R_1^2$ by Chiu (2017) and the first author (2016), using respectively microlocal sheaves and SFT. In the present article we recover this general contact non-squeezing theorem using generating functions, a classical method based on finite dimensional Morse theory. More precisely, we develop an equivariant version, with respect to a certain action of a finite cyclic group, of the generating function homology for domains of $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ defined by the second author (2011). A key role in the construction is played by translated chains of contactomorphisms, a generalization of translated points.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz geometry and combinatorics of circular snakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04446v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the Lipschitz geometric and combinatorial properties of germs of real semialgebraic surfaces (or, more generally, definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure) with circular link (homeomorphic to the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$). We define and investigate the outer Lipschitz geometry of the so-called circular snakes, showing what results in the paper "Lipschitz geometry and combinatorics of abnormal surface germs" (by Andrei Gabrielov and Emanoel Souza) valid to snakes still holds for the circular case. We prove the existence of a canonical decomposition for the Valette link of a circular snake into finitely many segments and nodal zones and establish some necessary and sufficient criteria to determine when it is possible to obtain a snake from a circular snake by "removing" either one of its segments or a H\"older triangle whose Valette link is contained in one of its nodal zones. We construct a combinatorial object associated with a circular snake and prove a realization theorem for this combinatorial object. We also present a weakly outer Lipschitz classification for circular snakes. Finally, we show some results about the combinatorics of binary circular snakes, which is wildly distinct from the corresponding case shown in the work of Gabrielov and Souza.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>
