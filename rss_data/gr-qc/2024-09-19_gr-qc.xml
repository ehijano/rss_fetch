      <title>Hamiltonian normal forms for the post-Newtonian binary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of the post-Newtonian (PN) two-body problem for two inspiraling compact bodies. Starting from a matter-only reduced Hamiltonian, we present an adapted framework based on the Lie series approach, enabling the derivation of complete perturbative solutions within the conservative sector. Our framework supports both circular and eccentric orbits, and is applicable to any perturbation respecting rotational invariance and time-independence. In the context of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) canonical formalism, this includes up to at least 3PN order and local terms beyond. We provide an example application at 2PN, recovering classical periapsis advance and orbital period corrections, alongside the full orbital evolution in time coordinates. We discuss eventual extension to spinning and time-dependent systems.</description>

      <title>Barrow Holographic Dark Energy in $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity: A dynamical system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of the Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BADE) model within the framework of $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity, specifically considering the model $f(Q,L_{m})=\alpha Q+\beta L_{m}$. Using a dynamical system approach for both non-interacting and interacting scenarios, we identify critical points corresponding to different phases of the Universe's evolution, including matter domination, radiation domination and dark energy-driven accelerated expansion. Our analysis reveals two stable critical points in the non-interacting case and three stable critical points in the interacting case, each indicating a transition to a stable phase dominated by BADE. The phase plots clearly demonstrate the evolution of the Universe's dynamics toward these stable points. At these stable points, the deceleration parameter is negative, consistent with accelerated expansion and the equation of state parameter suggests that BADE behaves as a dark energy component. These findings highlight the BADE model's strength as a viable explanation for the Universe's late-time acceleration inside $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity, and they provide novel perspectives on the cosmic development of dark energy-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Information Duality: Quantum Entanglement Contributions to Gravitational Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental duality between the geometric properties of spacetime and the informational content of quantum fields. Specifically, we establish that the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the entanglement entropy of quantum states, with geometric invariants mapping to informational measures. This framework modifies Einstein's field equations by introducing an informational stress-energy tensor derived from quantum entanglement entropy. Our findings have implications for black hole thermodynamics, cosmology, and quantum gravity, suggesting that quantum information fundamentally shapes the structure of spacetime. We incorporate this informational stress-energy tensor into Einstein's field equations, leading to modified spacetime geometry, particularly in regimes of strong gravitational fields, such as near black holes. We compute corrections to Newton's constant $G$ due to entanglement entropy contributions from various quantum fields and explore the consequences for black hole thermodynamics and cosmology. Our results indicate that quantum information plays a crucial role in gravitational dynamics, providing new insights into the nature of spacetime and potential solutions to long-standing challenges in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Phantom BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetized Black Holes and Swirling Backgrounds in Nonlinear Electrodynamics: The ModMax case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on constructing electromagnetized black holes and vortex-like backgrounds within the framework of the ModMax theory--the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves conformal symmetry and electromagnetic duality invariance. We begin by constructing the Melvin-Bonnor electromagnetic universe in ModMax through a limiting procedure that connects the spacetime of two charged accelerating black holes with that of a gravitating homogeneous electromagnetic field. Building on this result, we proceed to construct the Schwarzschild and C-metric Melvin-Bonnor black holes within the ModMax theory, representing the first black hole solutions embedded in an electromagnetic universe in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics. While the characteristics of the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and some of its black hole extensions have been widely examined, we demonstrate for the first time that the Schwarzschild-Melvin-Bonnor configuration exhibits an unusual Kerr-Schild representation. Following this direction, we also unveil a novel Kerr-Schild construction for the spacetime of two accelerating black holes, drawing on the intrinsic relationship between the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and the C-metric. Finally, we expand the spectrum of exact gravitational solutions within Einstein-ModMax theory by constructing a vortex-like background that coexists with the Melvin-Bonnor universe. In this process, the Taub-NUT spacetime in ModMax has played a crucial role. We also present an extended Taub-NUT solution that incorporates the contribution of a monopole-like magnetic component in the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Some Theoretical Aspects of Observation of Acceleration Induced Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work by M.H.Lynch, E.Cohen, Y.Hadad and I.Kaminer (LCHK), a modified model of the Unruh-DeWitt quantum detector, coupled to a 4-vector current, has been proposed to examine the radiation emitted by high energy positrons channeled into silicon crystal samples. Inspired by their ideas, we analyze theoretical aspects of such a model, its internal consistency, and ignore all questions related to experiments. The two-potential correlation functions for the quantized electromagnetic field in a vacuum state and the corresponding detector radiation power (DRP), considered in proper time formalism, are used as the basis for investigating the radiation observed at an accelerating point detector. The quantum detector is assumed to be moving through an electromagnetic vacuum along a classical hyperbolic trajectory with a constant proper acceleration. The DRP is obtained for three possible cases. First, the DRP is found in a Lorentz-invariant manner. It contains both transverse and non-physical longitudinal polarization modes and is a divergent quantity. Second, the radiation power holds only physical transverse modes but it is non-relativistic and also depends on the detector proper time, which contradicts the fact that there is no preferred time for hyperbolic detector motion. Third, in the case considered by LCHK, for zero detector proper time when its velocity in the lab inertial system is zero, the radiation power with transverse modes shows some signs of thermality which could be associated with a detector acceleration but different from the Bose-Einstein statistics expected for the photon field. If the detector energy gap is zero then, in complete contradiction with what LCHK claim, there is no radiation and no "thermalized Larmor formula". Based on our analysis we do not believe that the LCHK's model can be used to support the idea about thermal effects of uniform acceleration.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and shadow by a Schwarzschild-like black hole in metric-affine bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect and the shadow around a Schwarzschild-like black hole in metric-affine bumblebee gravity, which leads to the Lorentz symmetry breaking. We first present a generalized formalism for calculating higher-order corrections to light weak bending angle in a static, spherically symmetric and not asymptotically flat spacetime, and then applying this general formalism to the metric-affine bumblebee gravity. Moreover, we derive the light deflection angle and the size of the Einstein ring within the weak field in this scenario. In addition, we analyze the black hole shadow in this theory framework. By using observational data from the Einstein's ring of the galaxy ESO325-G004 and the black hole shadow of the ${\rm M}87$ galaxy, we estimate the upper bounds of the Lorentz symmetry breaking coefficient $\ell$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Motion of test particles around an Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black hole in a uniform magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the motion of a magnetized particle orbiting a static and spherically symmetric black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Similar to the Schwarzschild case, the magnetic interaction creates a region that allows circular stable orbits near the photonic sphere, however, we show that regions in which there are no allowed solutions for circular orbits appear before the marginal stability was reached for weak magnetic interaction. The regions of allowed stable circular orbits were calculated for different values of the dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $p$ and magnetic coupling parameter $\beta$, concluding that the increase of $p$ reduces the regions of stable circular orbits. The calculations were carried out using numerical black hole solutions and were compared with an analytical approximation with an error below $5\%$ for $p&lt;0.25$.</description>

      <title>How the Schwarzschild-de Sitter horizons remain in thermal equilibrium at vastly different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion of thermal equilibrium for a static fluid in a static spacetime is generalized to stationary heat conduction, in the approximation in which backreaction is negligible. Applying this generalized criterion to the Hawking radiation in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry shows that the two horizons (which act as thermostats) remain in thermal equilibrium. The temperature of the radiation fluid interpolates between the temperatures at the horizons, with a static analytic profile that is given explicitly.</description>

      <title>Fractional Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the possibility of starting the process of collapsing and forming stars from a fractional molecular cloud. Although the Verlinde's approach is employed to derive the corresponding gravitational potential, the results are easily generalizable to other gravitational potential proposals for fractional systems. It is due to the fact that the different methods, despite the difference in the details of results, all obtain power forms for the potential in terms of radius. An essential result of this analysis is the derivation of the corresponding Jeans mass limit, which is a crucial parameter in understanding the formation of stars. The study shows that the Jeans mass of a cloud in fractional gravity is much smaller than the traditional value. In addition, the study also determines the burning temperature of the resulting star using the Gamow theory. This calculation provides insight into the complex processes that govern the evolution of these celestial bodies. Finally, the study briefly discusses the investigation of hydrostatic equilibrium, a crucial condition that ensures the stability of these fractional stars. It also addresses the corresponding Lane--Emden equation, which is pivotal in understanding this equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Constrain from shadows of $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ and quasiperiodic oscillations of galactic microquasars on a black hole arising from metric-affine bumblebee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a static spherically symmetric black hole metric that originates from the vacuum solution of the traceless metric-affine bumblebee model in which spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking occurs when the bumblebee fields acquire a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. A free Lorentz-violating parameter enters into the basic formulation of the metric-affine bumblebee model. In this study, we use observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration on $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ to analyse the shadow of the black hole and an attempt has been made to constrain that free Lorentz-violating parameter. We also investigate particle motion over time-like geodesics and compute the corresponding epicyclic frequencies. We further constrain the Lorentz-violating parameter by using the reported high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of microquasars, offering new insights into its possible impact on astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of the Entropy of Single-sided Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a state-counting derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for single-sided black holes. We firstly articulate the concept of the black hole microstates. Then we construct explicit mircostates of single-sided black holes in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant. These microstates are constructed by putting a Karch-Randall brane behind the black hole horizon. Their difference is described by different interior excitations which gravitationally backreact. We show that these microstates have nonperturbatively small overlaps with each other. As a result, we use this fact to give a state-counting derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for single-sided black holes. At the end, we notice that there are no negative norm states in the resulting Hilbert space of the black hole microstates which in turn ensures unitarity. All calculations in this paper are analytic and can be easily generalized to higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dark dimension with (little) strings attached</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We motivate a relation between dark energy and the scale of new physics in weakly coupled string theory. This mixing between infrared and ultraviolet physics leads to a unique corner for real-world phenomenology: barring fine-tunings, we are naturally led to the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a single mesoscopic extra dimension of micron size with the standard model localized on D-branes. Our explicit top-down worldsheet derivation establishes it on a more solid grounding. Allowing some fine-tuning, such that the vacuum energy only arise at higher orders in string perturbation theory, the ``little string theory'' scenario with a very weakly coupled string is an alternative possibility. In this case, the string scale lies at the edge of detectability of particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion in a toroidally magnetized medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a black hole traveling through a plasma -- a general relativistic extension of the classic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion problem -- can be related to a variety of astrophysical contexts, including the aftermath of binary black hole mergers in gaseous environments. We perform three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto a rotating black hole for an incoming flow with a toroidal (inclined) magnetization with respect to the spin axis of the black hole. Irrespective of inclination but dependent on the wind speed, we find that the accretion flow onto the black hole can become magnetically arrested, launching an intermittent (and sometimes striped) jet. The upstream ram pressure of the wind bends the jet, and confines the angular extent into which the magnetic flux tubes ejected from quasi-periodic eruptions are released. Recoil from magnetic flux eruptions drives strong oscillations in the accretion plane, resulting in jet nutation at the outer radii and occasionally ripping off the inner part of the accretion disk. In addition to dynamical friction, the black hole experiences a perpendicular drag force analogous to the Magnus effect. Qualitative effects of the incoming magnetic field orientation, the strength of the magnetization, and the incoming wind speed are investigated as well.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Unruh effect with a direct, probability-level calculation. We rederive the transition rate of a uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt monopole detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial (Minkowski) observer and an accelerating (Rindler) observer. We show that, for a measurement at a finite time after the initial state is prepared, the two perspectives give the same transition rate. We show that an inertial detector in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles responds differently to the accelerated detector (which perceives a thermal bath of Rindler particles), except in the case of a massless field where there is agreement at all times. Finally, numerical results for the transition rate are presented and explained. We highlight the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, Wei et al. [arXiv:2409.09333] proposed a universal classification scheme that interprets black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space, and then divides black hole solutions into four distinct classes, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$, offering insights into deeper aspects of black hole thermodynamics and gravity. In this paper, we investigate the universal thermodynamic topological classification of the singly rotating Kerr black holes in all dimensions, as well as the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole. We show that the innermost small black hole states of the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable, while those of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, the outermost large black holes exhibit unstable behavior in all these cases. At the low-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have one large thermodynamically unstable black hole, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes feature one large unstable branch and one small stable branch. Conversely, at the high-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes exhibit a small unstable black hole state, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have no black hole states at all. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{1-}$, whereas the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman and $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{0+}$, thereby further support the conjecture proposed in [arXiv:2409.09333].</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-particle sector for the field-theoretical model of gravitationally induced decoherence for a scalar field in [1] with a special focus on the renormalisation of the one-particle master equation. In contrast to existing models in the literature, where the renormalisation is usually performed after the Markov and rotating wave approximation and often only for certain limits such as the non- or ultra-relativistic limit, here we apply the renormalisation directly after the one-particle projection. With this strategy, we show that UV-divergent contributions in the one-particle master equation can be identified with the vacuum contributions in the self-energy of the scalar field in the effective quantum field theory and depending on the chosen one-particle projection method, its vacuum bubbles, while the additional thermal contributions in the self-energy are all UV-finite. To obtain the renormalised one-particle master equation, we use an on-shell renormalisation procedure of the underlying effective QFT. We then apply the Markov and rotating wave approximation, specifying a condition under which the Markov approximation can be applied in the case of the ultra-relativistic limit. We compare our results with those available in the literature. This includes an analysis of two different kinds of one-particle projections, a comparison of the application and effects of renormalisation of quantum mechanical and field theoretical models, the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of the renormalised one-particle master equations, and a comparison with a quantum mechanical toy model for gravitationally induced decoherence in the context of neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the classical phase space of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant on spatial slices with circle topology. This turns out to be somewhat more intricate than in the case of negative cosmological constant; this phase space has many singular points and is not even Hausdorff. Nonetheless, it admits a group-theoretic description which is quite amenable to quantization.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection method of gravitational waves (GW) using electromagnetic (EM) cavities has garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper thoroughly examines the analysis for the perturbation of the EM field and raises some issues in the existing literature. Our work demonstrates that the rigidity condition imposed on the material, as provided in the literature, is inappropriate due to its reliance on a gauge-dependent quantity that cannot be controlled experimentally. Instead, we incorporate elasticity into the material and revise the governing equations for the electric field induced by GWs, expressing them solely in terms of gauge-invariant quantities. Applying these equations to cylindrical cavities, we present the GW antenna patterns for the detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to conformal transformations, disformal transformations can change the principal null directions of a spacetime geometry. Thus, depending on the frame a gravitational wave (GW) detector minimally couples to, the properties of GWs may change under a disformal transformation. In this paper, we provide \textit{necessary} and \textit{sufficient} conditions which determine whether GWs change under disformal transformations or not. Our argument is coordinate-independent and can be applied to any spacetime geometry at the fully non-linear level. As an example, we show that an exact radiative solution of massless Einstein-scalar gravity which admits only shear-free parallel transported frame is mapped to a disformed geometry which does not possess any shear-free parallel transported frame. This radiative geometry and its disformed counterpart provide a concrete example of the possibility to generate tensorial GWs from a disformal transformation at the fully non-linear level. This type of non-linear effect can be completely overlooked in the usual linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a phenomenologically and theoretically consistent limit of the generic Einstein-Aether theory in which the Einstein-Aether field equations reduce to Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution sourced by the aether field. This limit is obtained by taking three of the coupling constants of the theory to be zero but keeping the expansion coupling constant to be nonzero. We then consider the further reduction of this limited version of Einstein-Aether theory by taking the expansion of the aether field to be constant (possibly zero), and thereby we introduce the Minimal Einstein-Aether theory that supports the Einstein metrics as solutions with a reduced cosmological constant. The square of the expansion of the unit-timelike aether field shifts the bare cosmological constant and thus provides, via local Lorentz symmetry breaking inherent in the Einstein-Aether theories, a novel mechanism for reconciling the observed, small cosmological constant (or dark energy) with the large theoretical prediction coming from quantum field theories. The crucial point here is that minimal Einstein-Aether theory does not modify the well-tested aspects of General Relativity such as solar system tests and black hole physics including gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of geodesic completeness of cosmological spacetimes has recently received renewed scrutiny. A particularly interesting result is the observation that the well-known Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem may misdiagnose geodesically complete cosmologies. We propose a simple amendment to the BGV theorem which addresses such loopholes while retaining much of its generality. We give straightforward proofs of some recently offered conjectures concerning (generalized) Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: geodesic completeness implies (i) the existence of a bounce, loitering phase or an emergent cosmology, and (ii) a phase of accelerated expansion with strictly increasing Hubble rate. Our results are purely kinematic and do not assume general relativity or energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we derive flux-balance laws for four of the five constants for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, in particular a novel flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a formalism for solving the Lorenz gauge equations for metric perturbations of Kerr spacetime sourced by an arbitrary stress-energy tensor. The metric perturbation is obtained as a sum of differential operators acting on a set of six scalars, with two of spin-weight $\pm2$, two of spin-weight $\pm1$, and two of spin-weight $0$. We derive the sourced Teukolsky equations satisfied by these scalars, with the sources given in terms of differential operators acting on the stress-energy tensor. The method can be used to obtain both linear and higher order nonlinear metric perturbations, and it fully determines the metric perturbation up to a time integral, omitting only static contributions which must be handled separately.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Higgs mechanism for the self-dual spin connection (also known as the Ashtekar connection), using the Pleba\'{n}ski formulation of gravity. We develop our formalism within the framework of the chiral action and derive the equations of motion of the theory. One particular test model is explored: since anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the theory, a modified version of the spatially flat Bianchi I model with two different scale factors is considered. We apply our formalism and derive the Friedmann equations which regulate the scale factors and the Higgs field. We also present a Proca-like term for the connection, which when reduced to minisuperspace with a positive $\Lambda$ yields a De Sitter universe with an effective cosmological constant that depends on the mass of the gauge fields. We finally investigate the effect of these mass terms on gravitational waves and find that the wave equation remains unchanged relatively to GR; however the Weyl tensor is scaled by a constant which depends on the mass of the connection components.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>

Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence and wave optics techniques, we conducted an extensive study of the imaging properties of holographic Einstein rings in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes (BHs) in Horndeski theory. Our results indicate that the optical characteristics of these holographic Einstein rings are significantly influenced by the observer's position, the physical parameters of the BH, the nature of the wave source, and the configuration of the optical system. Specifically, when the observer is positioned at the north pole of the AdS boundary, the holographic image prominently displays a ring structure aligning with the BH's photon sphere. We thoroughly analyzed how various physical parameters -- including the observation position, event horizon radius, temperature, and the parameter $\gamma$ in Horndeski theory -- affect the holographic Einstein rings. These parameters play a crucial role in determining the rings' radius and brightness, with variations potentially causing the ring structures to deform or even transform into bright spots. Furthermore, our comparative analysis between wave optics and geometric optics reveals a strong agreement in predicting the positions and brightnesses of both the photon ring and the Einstein ring. This research offers new insights into the spacetime geometry of BHs in Horndeski theory and proposes a promising framework for exploring the gravitational duals of strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic expansion of the spacetime metric at the event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's local rigidity theorem, proven in the smooth setting by Alexakis-Ionescu-Klainerman, says that the event horizon of any stationary non-extremal black hole is a non-degenerate Killing horizon. In this paper, we prove that the full asymptotic expansion of any smooth vacuum metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon is determined by the geometry of the horizon. This gives a new perspective on the black hole uniqueness conjecture. In spacetime dimension $4$, we also prove an existence theorem: Given any non-degenerate horizon geometry, Einstein's vacuum equations can be solved to infinite order at the horizon in a unique way (up to isometry). The latter is a gauge invariant version of Moncrief's classical existence result, without any restriction on the topology of the horizon. In the real analytic setting, the asymptotic expansion is shown to converge and we get well-posedness of this characteristic Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Disjointness of inertial KMS states and the role of Lorentz symmetry in thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint, i.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary, have separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike cluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by the inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus showing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial frame is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We review the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems theory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior of detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue that the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant velocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot thermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the physical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged "heat bath" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and RTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest frame of the detector.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Selective Amplification of a Gravitational Wave Signal Using an Atomic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel principle for quantum sensing of gravitational waves by exploiting the collective emission rate of a one-dimensional array of initially uncorrelated atoms to selectively amplify a gravitational wave signal over flat spacetime contributions. In contrast to a single atom, we find that the collective emission rate of the array is sensitive to the gravitational wave at first order in its amplitude. We quantify the collective response of the array to an incident gravitational wave by introducing the notion of the effective number of atoms cooperating to sense the gravitational wave. We determine the optimal interatomic spacing such that the flat spacetime collective effects vanish, but the imprint of the gravitational wave in the emission rate of the array scales nearly quadratically with the number of atoms. The near-quadratic scaling counteracts the small amplitude of the gravitational wave. Furthermore, the coherent photon emission, which encodes the gravitational wave imprint, exhibits well-defined directionality and occurs at frequencies shifted by the wave's frequency. We analyze the setup's response to prototypical gravitational wave signals and show that, for coherent array sizes potentially realizable in the near-term, the two advancements - collective response at first order in the gravitational wave's amplitude, and near-quadratic scaling with the number of atoms - yield a photon emission rate large enough to be resolved by current technology in photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Fermions in the fuzzy sphere Kaluza-Klein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly match the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>
