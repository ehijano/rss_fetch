      <title>Progress on the spectroscopy of lattice gauge theories using spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode non-perturbative information crucial in computing physical observables in strongly coupled field theories. Using lattice gauge theory data, we perform a systematic study to demonstrate the potential of recent technological advances in the reconstruction of spectral densities. We develop, maintain and make publicly available dedicated analysis code that can be used for broad classes of lattice theories. As a test case, we analyse the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to an admixture of fermions transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. We measure the masses of mesons in energy-smeared spectral densities, after optimising the smearing parameters for available lattice ensembles. We present a summary of the mesons mass spectrum in all the twelve (flavored) channels available, including also several excited states.</description>

      <title>Quark Gas at High Temperature: Finite-Volume Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the textbook formula for the pressure of free massless fermions leads to negative values of the probability mass function of the distribution of the system of free massless fermions in the fermion number. The ways to resolve this paradox are proposed. A detailed analysis of the corresponding partition function indicates the presence of a Roberge-Weiss transition in the absence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Progress on pseudoscalar flavour-singlets in Sp(4) with mixed fermion representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the masses of the pseudoscalar flavour-singlet meson states in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation and three Dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation. This theory provides a compelling ultraviolet completion for the minimal composite Higgs model implementing also partial compositeness for the top quark. The spectrum contains two, comparatively light, pseudoscalar flavour-singlet states, which mix with one another. One of them is a Nambu-Goldstone boson (in the massless limit), whereas the other receives a mass from the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. We demonstrate how to measure the mixing between these two states. For moderately heavy fermion masses, we find that the two wave functions are dominated by one of the fermion representations, mixing effects being small.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Exploring lattice supersymmetry with variational quantum deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice studies of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking suffer from a sign problem that in principle can be evaded through novel methods enabled by quantum computing. Focusing on lower-dimensional lattice systems with more modest resource requirements, in particular the N=1 Wess--Zumino model in 1+1 dimensions, we are exploring ways quantum computing could be used to study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. A particularly promising recent development is to apply the variational quantum deflation algorithm, which generalizes the variational quantum eigensolver so as to resolve multiple low-energy states.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future neutrino research program will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for Charge-Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) scattering, on the combination of "nucleon physics" expressed by form factors and "nuclear physics" expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. This talk presents a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas (CFG) Model for CCQE electron-nuclei and neutrino-nuclei scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the semileptonic $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

Abstract: We review the calculation of suppression of Chiral Separational and Chiral Vortical Effects for strange quarks (which allegedly yield spin polarization of $\Lambda/\bar\Lambda$-hyperons in peripheral Heavy-Ion Collisions) by the non-perturbative interactions in hot deconfined QCD with the Field Correlator Method. The parameter range in the temperature-baryon density plane is expected to cover LHC-ALICE and RHIC-STAR data.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>QCD in the chiral SU(3) limit from baryon masses on Lattice QCD ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon masses on CLS ensembles are used to determine the LEC that characterize QCD in the flavor-SU(3) limit with vanishing up, down, and strange quark masses. Here we reevaluate some of the baryon masses on flavor-symmetric ensembles with much-improved statistical precision, in particular for the decuplet states. These additional results then lead to a more significant chiral extrapolation of the Lattice data set to its chiral SU(3) limit. Our results are based on the chiral Lagrangian with baryon octet and decuplet fields considered at the one-loop level. Finite-box and discretization effects of the Lattice data are considered systematically. While in our global fit of the data we insist on large-Nc sum rules for the LEC that enter at N3LO, all other LEC are unconstrained. In particular, we obtain values for the chiral limit of the pion decay constant and the isospin-limit of the quark-mass ratio compatible with the FLAG report.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone modes in a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multi flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>
