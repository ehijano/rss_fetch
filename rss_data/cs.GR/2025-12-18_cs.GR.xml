      <title>Probabilistic Inclusion Depth for Fuzzy Contour Ensemble Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Probabilistic Inclusion Depth (PID) for the ensemble visualization of scalar fields. By introducing a probabilistic inclusion operator $\subset_{\!p}$, our method is a general data depth model supporting ensembles of fuzzy contours, such as soft masks from modern segmentation methods, and conventional ensembles of binary contours. We also advocate to extend contour extraction in scalar field ensembles to become a fuzzy decision by considering the probabilistic distribution of an isovalue to encode the sensitivity information. To reduce the complexity of the data depth computation, an efficient approximation using the mean probabilistic contour is devised. Furthermore, an order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved with an efficient parallel algorithm on the GPU. Our new method enables the computation of contour boxplots for ensembles of probabilistic masks, ensembles defined on various types of grids, and large 3D ensembles that are not studied by existing methods. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques on synthetic datasets, through examples of real-world ensemble datasets, and expert feedback.</description>

      <title>Towards Physically-Based Sky-Modeling For Image Based Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications</description>

      <title>Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars: A Hybrid Representation for Efficient Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), photorealistic head avatars that can be generated from multi-view images and efficiently rendered on mobile devices. GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians. These components are rendered simultaneously in a unified rendering engine. The networks are trained using multi-view image supervision. Our results demonstrate that GPiCA achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars.</description>

      <title>TerraFusion: Joint Generation of Terrain Geometry and Texture Using Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D terrain models are essential in fields such as video game development and film production. Since surface color often correlates with terrain geometry, capturing this relationship is crucial to achieving realism. However, most existing methods generate either a heightmap or a texture, without sufficiently accounting for the inherent correlation. In this paper, we propose a method that jointly generates terrain heightmaps and textures using a latent diffusion model. First, we train the model in an unsupervised manner to randomly generate paired heightmaps and textures. Then, we perform supervised learning of an external adapter to enable user control via hand-drawn sketches. Experiments show that our approach allows intuitive terrain generation while preserving the correlation between heightmaps and textures.</description>
