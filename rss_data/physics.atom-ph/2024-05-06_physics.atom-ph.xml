      <title>Laser Resonance Chromatography of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ in He: an ab initio investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a laser resonance chromatography (LRC) experiment on $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$, with the goal of detecting the ion's electronic ground $5f$ $^2$F$_{5/2}$ state and metastable $7s$ $^2$S$_{1/2}$ state by means of their ion mobilities. To this end, we first model the ion-neutral interaction potentials for the two electronic states with a relativistic Fock space coupled cluster method and complete basis-set extrapolation scheme. The interaction potentials are used to simulate the state-specific reduced ion mobilities in terms of the operating temperature and the external electric field. The ion mobilities differ by more than 7% at 300 K and moderate field strengths; thus, separation of the $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ metastable state lies within the reach of LRC experiments targeting optical probing and monitoring of the nuclear clock transition in this isotope.</description>

      <title>A warm Rydberg atom-based quadrature amplitude-modulated receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Lepton-neutron interaction and S-wave low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lepton-neutron potential in configuration space is obtained. It is based on the Coulomb plus hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian integrated over the neutron charge and magnetic densities. Different parametrisations of the neutron electromagnetic form factors are compared. It is given in the operator form with a central, spin-spin, tensor and spin-orbit terms. The potentials for lowest partial waves states are presented. We compute the lepton-neutron lepton ($ln$) low-energy parameters for the S-waves, estimate the zero-energy cross sections for higher angular momentum states, and point out a possible divergence in the partial wave summation due to the spin-orbit potential.</description>

      <title>Interactions and cold collisions of AlF in the ground and excited electronic states with He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminium monofluoride (AlF) is a promising candidate for laser cooling and the production of dense ultracold molecular gases, thanks to its relatively high chemical stability and diagonal Frank-Condon factors. In this study, we examine the interactions and collisions of AlF in its $X^1\Sigma^+$, $a^3\Pi$, and $A^{1}\Pi$ electronic states with ground-state He using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry techniques. We construct accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) employing either the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster CCSD(T)-F12 method augmented by the CCSDT correction or the multireference configuration-interaction method for higher-excited electronic states. Subsequently, we employ these PESs in coupled-channel calculations to determine the scattering cross-sections for AlF+He collisions and bound states of the complex. We estimate the uncertainty of the calculated PESs and apply it to assess the uncertainty of the scattering results. We find a relatively low sensitivity of the cross-sections to the variation of the PESs, but the positions of shape resonances remain uncertain. The present results are relevant for further improvements and optimizations of buffer-gas cooling of AlF molecules.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <title>A cavity-microscope for micrometer-scale control of atom-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers the possibility to observe and control the motion of few or individual atoms, enabling the realization of various quantum technological tasks such as quantum-enhanced metrology or quantum simulation of strongly-correlated matter. A core limitation of these experiments lies in the mode structure of the cavity field, which is hard-coded in the shape and geometry of the mirrors. As a result, most applications of cavity QED trade spatial resolution for enhanced sensitivity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a cavity-microscope device capable of controlling in space and time the coupling between atoms and light in a single-mode high-finesse cavity, reaching a spatial resolution an order-of-magnitude lower than the cavity mode waist. This is achieved through local Floquet engineering of the atomic level structure, imprinting a corresponding atom-field coupling. We illustrate this capability by engineering micrometer-scale coupling, using cavity-assisted atomic measurements and optimization. Our system forms an optical device with a single optical axis and has the same footprint and complexity as a standard Fabry-Perot cavity or confocal lens pair, and can be used for any atomic species. This technique opens a wide range of perspectives from ultra-fast, cavity-enhanced mid-circuit readout to the quantum simulation of fully connected models of quantum matter such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Modulation transfer protocol for Rydberg RF receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare very well to semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>

      <title>Reversal of quantised Hall drifts at non-interacting and interacting topological boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of topological edge states and their response to interparticle interactions. Here, we experimentally study long-distance quantised Hall drifts in a harmonically confined topological pump of non-interacting and interacting ultracold fermionic atoms. We find that quantised drifts halt and reverse their direction when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponds to a band transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for non-interacting particles. We establish that a non-zero repulsive Hubbard interaction leads to the emergence of an additional edge in the system, relying on a purely interaction-induced mechanism, in which pairs of fermions are split.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>
