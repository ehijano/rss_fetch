      <title>Emergence of Synchronization-Induced Patterns in Two-dimensional Magnetic Rod Systems under Rotating Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two-dimensional assemblies of rod-shaped magnetic colloids under the influence of an external rotating magnetic field. Using Molecular Dynamics, we simulate the formation of patterns that emerge based on the synchronization degree between the magnetic rods and the rotating field. We then explore the structural and dynamic characteristics of the resulting steady states, examining their evolution as a function of changes in the rods' aspect ratio, the strength of the external magnetic field, and its rotation frequency. Three distinct synchronization regimes of the rods with the magnetic field are clearly observed. A detailed set of phase diagrams illustrates the complex relationship between the magnitude of the external magnetic field and its rotation frequency and how these parameters govern the formation of unique self-organized structures.</description>

      <title>Cracking of submerged beds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomena of crater formation and gas release caused by projectile impact on underwater beds, which occurs in many natural, geophysical, and industrial applications. The bed in our experiment is constructed of hydrophobic particles, which trap a substantial amount of air in its pores. In contrast to dry beds, the air-water interface in a submerged bed generates a granular skin that provides rigidity to the medium by producing skin over the bulk. The projectile's energy is used to reorganise the grains, which causes the skin to crack, allowing the trapped air to escape. The morphology of the craters as a function of impact energy in submerged beds exhibits different scaling laws than what is known for dry beds. This phenomenon is attributed to the contact line motion on the hydrophobic fractal-like surface of submerged grains. The volume of the gas released is a function of multiple factors, chiefly the velocity of the projectile, depth of the bed and depth of the water column.</description>

      <title>Study of triaxial loading of segregated granular assemblies through experiments and DEM simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple position-dependent body force-based confinement for simulating triaxial tests using the Discrete Element Method is presented. The said method is used to perform triaxial simulations on mono-disperse and segregated assemblies of glass spheres. The macroscopic load response obtained in simulations is validated with experimental load response. A mesh construction algorithm is presented to check whether the confinement applied in the triaxial simulations is accurate. The particle displacement data obtained from triaxial simulations are used to obtain a particle-wise average strain tensor. This is further used to compare the strain localisation between the mono-disperse and segregated assemblies. It is observed that, in the segregated assembly, the interface between the two particle phases acts as a barrier for strain localisation, and the smaller particles preferentially undergo a higher degree of shear strain on average.</description>

      <title>A review of active matter reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past years, the amount of research on active matter has grown extremely rapidly, a fact that is reflected in particular by the existence of more than 600 review articles on this topic. Moreover, the field has become very diverse, ranging from theoretical studies of the statistical mechanics of active particles to applied work on medical applications of microrobots and from biological systems to artificial swimmers. This makes it very difficult to get an overview over the field as a whole. Here, we provide such an overview in the form of a metareview article that surveys the existing review articles on active matter. Thereby, this article provides an introduction to the various subdisciplines of active matter science and constitutes a useful starting point for finding literature about a specific topic.</description>

      <title>Rapid Sensing of Heat Stress using Machine Learning of Micrographs of Red Blood Cells Dispersed in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An imbalance between bodily heat production and heat dissipation leads to heat stress in organisms. In addition to diminished animal well-being, heat stress is detrimental to the poultry industry as poultry entails fast growth and high yield, resulting in greater metabolic activity and higher body heat production. When stressed, cells overexpress heat shock proteins (such as HSP70, a well-established intracellular stress indicator) and may undergo changes in their mechanical properties. Liquid crystals (LCs, fluids with orientational order) have been recently employed to rapidly characterize changes in mechanical properties of cells enabling a means of optically reporting the presence of disease in organisms. In this work, we explore the difference in the expression of HSP70 to a change in the LC response pattern via the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The machine-learning (ML) models were trained on hundreds of such LC-response micrographs of chicken red blood cells with and without heat stress. Trained models exhibited remarkable accuracy of up to 99% on detecting the presence of heat stress in unseen microscope samples. We also show that crosslinking the chicken and human RBCs using glutaraldehyde in order to simulate a diseased cell was an efficient strategy for planning, building, training, and evaluating ML models. Overall, our efforts build towards the rapid detection of disease in organisms, which is accompanied by a distinct change in the mechanical properties of cells. We aim to eventuate CNN-enabled LC-sensors can rapidly report the presence of disease in scenarios where human judgment could be prohibitively difficult or slow.</description>

      <title>Procedural Construction of Atomistic Polyurethane Block Copolymer Models for High Throughput Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, methods are presented to automatically generate a fully atomistic LAMMPS models of arbitrary linear multiblock polyurethane copolymers. The routine detailed here receives as parameters the number of repeat units per hard block, the number of units in a soft block, and the number of soft blocks per chain, as well as chemical formulae of three monomers which will form the hard component, soft component, and chain extender. A routine is detailed for converting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded repeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble these units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this work to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in different parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a variety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray scattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated models reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as some of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into the partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the two block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects of various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block connectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for constructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high throughput workflow for material design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Micro-mechanical response and power-law exponents from the longitudinal fluctuations of F-actin solutions</title>

Abstract: We investigate the local fluctuations of filamentous actin (F-actin), with focus on the skeletal thin filament, using single-particle optical trapping interferometry. This experimental technique allows us to detect the Brownian motion of a tracer bead immersed in a complex fluid with nanometric resolution at the microsecond time-scale. The mean square displacement, loss modulus, and velocity autocorrelation function (VAF) of the trapped microprobes in the fluid follow power-law behaviors, whose exponents can be determined in the short-time/high-frequency regime along several decades. We obtain 7/8 subdiffusive power-law exponents for polystyrene depleted microtracers at low optical trapping forces. Microrheologically, the elastic modulus of these suspensions is observed to be constant up to the limit of high frequencies, confirming the origin of this subdiffusive exponent on the local longitudinal fluctuations of the polymers. Deviations from this value are measured and discussed in relation to the characteristic lengths scales of these F-actin networks and probes' properties, and also in connection with the different power-law exponents detected in the VAFs. Finally, we observe that the thin filament, composed by tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) coupled to F-actin in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$, returns exponent values less dispersed than F-actin alone, which we interpret as a micro-measurement of the filament stabilization.</description>

      <title>Self-organized vortex phases and hydrodynamic interactions in Bos taurus sperm cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flocking behavior is observed in biological systems from the cellular to super-organismal length scales, and the mechanisms and purposes of this behavior are objects of intense interest. In this paper, we study the collective dynamics of bovine sperm cells in a viscoelastic fluid. These cells appear not to spontaneously flock, but transition into a long-lived flocking phase after being exposed to a transient ordering pulse of fluid flow. Surprisingly, this induced flocking phase has many qualitative similarities with the spontaneous polar flocking phases predicted by Toner-Tu theory, such as anisotropic giant number fluctuations and non-trivial transverse density correlations, despite the induced nature of the phase and the clearly important role of momentum conservation between the swimmers and the surrounding fluid in these experiments. We also find self-organized global vortex state of the sperm cells, and map out an experimental phase diagram of states of collective motion as a function of cell density and motility statistics. We compare our experiments with a parameter-matched computational model of persistently turning active particles, and find that the experimental order-disorder phase boundary as a function of cell density and persistence time can be approximately predicted from measures of single-cell properties. Our results may have implications for the evaluation of sample fertility by studying the collective phase behavior of dense groups of swimming sperm.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing to gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous structure and dynamics of water in a hydrated collagen microfibril</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collagen type I is well-known for its outstanding mechanical properties which it inherits from its hierarchical structure. Collagen type I fibrils may be viewed as a composite material made of protein, macromolecules (such as glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans) and water. Water content modulates the properties of these fibrils. Yet, the properties of water and the fine interactions of water with the protein constituent of these nanocomposites have only received limited attention. Here, we propose to model collagen type I fibrils as an hydrated structure made of tropocollagen molecules assembled in a microfibril crystal. We perform large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the hydration of collagen fibrils beyond the onset of disassembly. We found that the structural and dynamic properties of water vary strongly with the level of hydration of the microfibril. More importantly, we found that the properties vary spatially within the 67 nm D-spacing periodic structure. Denaturation of the structural and dynamical properties of the collagen microfibril occur first in the gap region. Overall, we identify that the change in the role of water molecules from glue to lubricant between tropocollagen molecules arises around 100% hydration while the microfibril begins to disassemble beyond 130% water content. Our findings are supported by a decrease in hydrogen bonding, recovery of bulk water properties and amorphisation of the tropocollagen molecules packing. Our simulations reveal the structure and dynamics of hydrated collagen fibrils with unprecedented spatial resolution from physiological conditions to disassembly. Beyond the process of self-assembly and the emergence of mechanical properties of collagen type I fibrils, our results may also provide new insights in mineralization of collagen fibrils.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>
