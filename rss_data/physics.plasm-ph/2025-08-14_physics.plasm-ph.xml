      <title>Extracting a stochastic model for predator-prey dynamic of turbulence and zonal flows with limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between turbulence and zonal flows is critical for modeling turbulence transport in fusion plasmas, often described through predator-prey dynamics. However, traditional deterministic models like the Lotka-Volterra equations simplify this interaction and fail to capture the small fluctuations in simulation data. In this study, we develop a neural network model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to represent the predator-prey dynamics using limited data from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system. We extract the drift and diffusion terms via neural networks, incorporating physical constraints and employing the unscented transform to mitigate challenges brought by limited data. The model accurately reproduces key dynamical features, including stagnation phenomena and energy exchange mechanisms, and the state density distribution generated from the model shows a low KL divergence with the simulation data. A parameter scan reveals that zonal flow shearing efficiency decreases with amplitude, and predator-prey oscillations damp in the absence of stochasticity. These findings underscore the value of integrating physical insight into data-driven approaches for complex plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Simulation and First Prototype Development of a Microwave Plasma System for Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aid of COMSOL multiphysics simulations, a compact microwave plasma reactor operated at 2.45 GHz frequency has been designed for diamond film deposition. The reactor consists of a cylindrical cavity that resonates in the fundamental mode $TM_{01p}$ with a longitudinal field variation (p = 1). Investigations on microwave electric field and hydrogen $(H_{2})$ plasma characteristics inside the microwave plasma cavity have been carried out, which assisted in the resonant cavity optimizations. The new reactor design includes a unique antenna structure which facilitates better thermal management and gas inlet arrangement. Parametric analysis of the effect of increase in microwave power, gas pressure and synergistic effects of power and pressure variations on the $H_{2}$ plasma characteristics such as electron density, gas temperature, and atomic hydrogen density have been performed computationally to estimate the optimize reactor operating conditions. Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively. Preliminary experimental validation which includes vacuum integrity and $H_{2}$ plasma ignition tests inside the cavity are also reported.</description>

      <title>Probing ultrafast heating and ionization dynamics in solid density plasmas with time-resolved resonant X-ray absorption and emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating and ionization are among the most fundamental processes in ultra-short, relativistic laser-solid interactions. However, capturing their spatiotemporal evolution experimentally is challenging due to the inherently transient and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) nature. Here, time-resolved resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy, in conjunction with simultaneous X-ray absorption imaging, is employed to investigate such complex dynamics in a thin copper wire driven by an optical high-intensity laser pulse, with sub-picosecond temporal resolution. The diagnostic leverages the high brightness and narrow spectral bandwidth of an X-ray free-electron laser, to selectively excite resonant transitions of highly charged ions within the hot dense plasma generated by the optical laser. The measurements reveal a distinct rise-and-fall temporal evolution of the resonant X-ray emission yield-and consequently the selected ion population-over a 10 ps timescale, accompanied by an inversely correlated x-ray transmission. In addition, off-resonance emissions with comparable yields on both sides of the XFEL photon energy are clearly observed, indicating balanced ionization and recombination rates. Furthermore, experimental results are compared with comprehensive simulations using atomic collisional-radiative models, PIC, and MHD codes to elucidate the underlying physics. The comparison reveals that typical models overestimate the plasma heating under the extreme conditions achieved in our experiment, highlighting the requirement for improved modeling of NLTE collisional processes for predictive capabilities. These results are of broad interest to the high-energy-density science and inertial fusion energy research, both as an experimental platform for accessing theoretically challenging conditions and as a benchmark for improving models of high-power laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards controlling electron charge with nanoparticle assisted laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores nanoparticle-assisted electron injection as a method for controlling beam charge in laser wakefield acceleration through particle-in-cell simulations. We systematically investigate how the material (Li through Au) and size (50-200 nm) of nanoparticles influence electron injection dynamics and beam charge. Our results demonstrate that beam charge (10-600 pC) can be effectively controlled by adjusting these parameters. We identify a saturation threshold in the nanoparticle electric field strength, beyond which beam charge depends on the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle rather than on the electron density after ionization. Significant electron injection occurs across multiple plasma wave periods with distribution patterns influenced by nanoparticle properties leading to increased beam charge but a broader energy spread. These findings offer practical guidelines for experimental implementation of nanoparticle-assisted injection in laser wakefield accelerators to tailor electron beam characteristics for various applications.</description>

      <title>Energy Bunching from Sub-Cycle Ionization Injection in Laser Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of carrier-envelope phase-driven energy bunching in laser wakefield acceleration. Using a few-cycle (~9 fs), multi-terawatt laser pulse and ionization injection in a helium-nitrogen gas mixture, we observe electron spectra composed of multiple quasi-monoenergetic peaks with regular narrow energy spacing. This comb structure arises from intermittent injection from successive half-cycles of the laser field, enabled by the evolving carrier-envelope phase during propagation in the plasma. These findings establish sub-cycle ionization injection as a potential route to attosecond control in plasma acceleration, enabling injection and beam structuring synchronized to the optical waveform on sub-femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Double-Corrugated Degenerate Band-Edge Oscillator Driven by an Electron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of a degenerate band-edge (DBE) oscillator based on the synchronous interaction between a linear electron beam synchronized with four degenerate electromagnetic modes are presented. The DBE in the cold slow-wave structure is implemented in a rectangular waveguide with a staggered double corrugation in it. At the DBE, four modes coalesce into a single degenerate mode, forming a very flat dispersion diagram with vanishing or very small group velocity. The DBE oscillator frequency is robust to variations in electron beam current, electrons' velocity, and cavity length. The DBE oscillator concept provided here is expected to be extendable to several other geometries as long as the slow wave structure supports a DBE.</description>
