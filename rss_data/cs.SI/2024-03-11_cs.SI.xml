      <title>Corrective or Backfire: Characterizing and Predicting User Response to Social Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online misinformation poses a global risk with harmful implications for society. Ordinary social media users are known to actively reply to misinformation posts with counter-misinformation messages, which is shown to be effective in containing the spread of misinformation. Such a practice is defined as "social correction". Nevertheless, it remains unknown how users respond to social correction in real-world scenarios, especially, will it have a corrective or backfire effect on users. Investigating this research question is pivotal for developing and refining strategies that maximize the efficacy of social correction initiatives. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to characterize and predict the user response to social correction in a data-driven manner through the lens of X (Formerly Twitter), where the user response is instantiated as the reply that is written toward a counter-misinformation message. Particularly, we first create a novel dataset with 55, 549 triples of misinformation tweets, counter-misinformation replies, and responses to counter-misinformation replies, and then curate a taxonomy to illustrate different kinds of user responses. Next, fine-grained statistical analysis of reply linguistic and engagement features as well as repliers' user attributes is conducted to illustrate the characteristics that are significant in determining whether a reply will have a corrective or backfire effect. Finally, we build a user response prediction model to identify whether a social correction will be corrective, neutral, or have a backfire effect, which achieves a promising F1 score of 0.816. Our work enables stakeholders to monitor and predict user responses effectively, thus guiding the use of social correction to maximize their corrective impact and minimize backfire effects. The code and data is accessible on https://github.com/claws-lab/response-to-social-correction.</description>

      <title>Node Centrality Approximation For Large Networks Based On Inductive Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closeness Centrality (CC) and Betweenness Centrality (BC) are crucial metrics in network analysis, providing essential reference for discerning the significance of nodes within complex networks. These measures find wide applications in critical tasks, such as community detection and network dismantling. However, their practical implementation on extensive networks remains computationally demanding due to their high time complexity. To mitigate these computational challenges, numerous approximation algorithms have been developed to expedite the computation of CC and BC. Nevertheless, even these approximations still necessitate substantial processing time when applied to large-scale networks. Furthermore, their output proves sensitive to even minor perturbations within the network structure.
  In this work, We redefine the CC and BC node ranking problem as a machine learning problem and propose the CNCA-IGE model, which is an encoder-decoder model based on inductive graph neural networks designed to rank nodes based on specified CC or BC metrics. We incorporate the MLP-Mixer model as the decoder in the BC ranking prediction task to enhance the model's robustness and capacity. Our approach is evaluated on diverse synthetic and real-world networks of varying scales, and the experimental results demonstrate that the CNCA-IGE model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, significantly reducing execution time while improving performance.</description>

      <title>Automating the Information Extraction from Semi-Structured Interview Transcripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the development and application of an automated system designed to extract information from semi-structured interview transcripts. Given the labor-intensive nature of traditional qualitative analysis methods, such as coding, there exists a significant demand for tools that can facilitate the analysis process. Our research investigates various topic modeling techniques and concludes that the best model for analyzing interview texts is a combination of BERT embeddings and HDBSCAN clustering. We present a user-friendly software prototype that enables researchers, including those without programming skills, to efficiently process and visualize the thematic structure of interview data. This tool not only facilitates the initial stages of qualitative analysis but also offers insights into the interconnectedness of topics revealed, thereby enhancing the depth of qualitative analysis.</description>

      <title>SocialPET: Socially Informed Pattern Exploiting Training for Few-Shot Stance Detection in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance detection, as the task of determining the viewpoint of a social media post towards a target as 'favor' or 'against', has been understudied in the challenging yet realistic scenario where there is limited labeled data for a certain target. Our work advances research in few-shot stance detection by introducing SocialPET, a socially informed approach to leveraging language models for the task. Our proposed approach builds on the Pattern Exploiting Training (PET) technique, which addresses classification tasks as cloze questions through the use of language models. To enhance the approach with social awareness, we exploit the social network structure surrounding social media posts. We prove the effectiveness of SocialPET on two stance datasets, Multi-target and P-Stance, outperforming competitive stance detection models as well as the base model, PET, where the labeled instances for the target under study is as few as 100. When we delve into the results, we observe that SocialPET is comparatively strong in identifying instances of the `against' class, where baseline models underperform.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Timescales of a Complex System: A Bayesian Approach to Temporal Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the timescales at which complex systems evolve are essential to predicting critical transitions and catastrophic failures. Disentangling the timescales of the dynamics governing complex systems remains a key challenge. With this study, we introduce an integrated Bayesian framework based on temporal network models to address this challenge. We focus on two methodologies: change point detection for identifying shifts in system dynamics, and a spectrum analysis for inferring the distribution of timescales. Applied to synthetic and empirical datasets, these methologies robustly identify critical transitions and comprehensively map the dominant and subsidiaries timescales in complex systems. This dual approach offers a powerful tool for analyzing temporal networks, significantly enhancing our understanding of dynamic behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference of Parameters in Opinion Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the frequent use of agent-based models (ABMs) for studying social phenomena, parameter estimation remains a challenge, often relying on costly simulation-based heuristics. This work uses variational inference to estimate the parameters of an opinion dynamics ABM, by transforming the estimation problem into an optimization task that can be solved directly.
  Our proposal relies on probabilistic generative ABMs (PGABMs): we start by synthesizing a probabilistic generative model from the ABM rules. Then, we transform the inference process into an optimization problem suitable for automatic differentiation. In particular, we use the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization for categorical agent attributes and stochastic variational inference for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we explore the trade-offs of using variational distributions with different complexity: normal distributions and normalizing flows.
  We validate our method on a bounded confidence model with agent roles (leaders and followers). Our approach estimates both macroscopic (bounded confidence intervals and backfire thresholds) and microscopic ($200$ categorical, agent-level roles) more accurately than simulation-based and MCMC methods. Consequently, our technique enables experts to tune and validate their ABMs against real-world observations, thus providing insights into human behavior in social systems via data-driven analysis.</description>

      <title>Fairness Rising from the Ranks: HITS and PageRank on Homophilic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which link analysis algorithms prevent minority groups from reaching high ranking slots. We find that the most common link-based algorithms using centrality metrics, such as PageRank and HITS, can reproduce and even amplify bias against minority groups in networks. Yet, their behavior differs: one one hand, we empirically show that PageRank mirrors the degree distribution for most of the ranking positions and it can equalize representation of minorities among the top ranked nodes; on the other hand, we find that HITS amplifies pre-existing bias in homophilic networks through a novel theoretical analysis, supported by empirical results. We find the root cause of bias amplification in HITS to be the level of homophily present in the network, modeled through an evolving network model with two communities. We illustrate our theoretical analysis on both synthetic and real datasets and we present directions for future work.</description>

      <title>A "Perspectival" Mirror of the Elephant: Investigating Language Bias on Google, ChatGPT, YouTube, and Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to Google Search's mission of delivering information from "many angles so you can form your own understanding of the world," we find that Google and its most prominent returned results - Wikipedia and YouTube - simply reflect a narrow set of culturally dominant views tied to the search language for complex topics like "Buddhism," "Liberalism," "colonization," "Iran" and "America." Simply stated, they present, to varying degrees, distinct information across the same search in different languages, a phenomenon we call language bias. This paper presents evidence and analysis of language bias and discusses its larger social implications. We find that our online searches and emerging tools like ChatGPT turn us into the proverbial blind person touching a small portion of an elephant, ignorant of the existence of other cultural perspectives. Language bias sets a strong yet invisible cultural barrier online, where each language group thinks they can see other groups through searches, but in fact, what they see is their own reflection.</description>
