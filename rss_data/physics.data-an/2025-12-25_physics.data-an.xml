      <title>Physical Embodiment Enables Information Processing Beyond Explicit Sensing in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living microorganisms have evolved dedicated sensory machinery to detect environmental perturbations, processing these signals through biochemical networks to guide behavior. Replicating such capabilities in synthetic active matter remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic active particles can adapt to hidden hydrodynamic perturbations through physical embodiment alone, without explicit sensing mechanisms. Using reinforcement learning to control self-thermophoretic particles, we show that they learn navigation strategies to counteract unobserved flow fields by exploiting information encoded in their physical dynamics. Remarkably, particles successfully navigate perturbations that are not included in their state inputs, revealing that embodied dynamics can serve as an implicit sensing mechanism. This discovery establishes physical embodiment as a computational resource for information processing in active matter, with implications for autonomous microrobotic systems and bio-inspired computation.</description>

      <title>Active inference and artificial reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</description>
