      <title>A biomechanical study of neck strength and impact dynamics on head and neck injury parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are considered a silent epidemic. It affects many people, from automobiles to sports to service members. In this study, we employed a musculoskeletal head-neck model to understand the effect of impact locations, characteristics, and neck strength on head and neck injury severity. Three types of impact forces were studied: low-velocity impact (LVI), intermediate-velocity impact (IVI), and high-velocity impact (HVI). We investigated six parameters: linear and rotational accelerations, the Generalized Acceleration Model For Brain Injury Threshold (GAMBIT), neck force, neck moment, and Neck Injury Criteria (NIC). We consider seven impact locations, three neck strengths, and three impact characteristics. We studied a total of 63 cases. It was found that the linear accelerations do not change much with different neck strengths and impact locations. The impact locations have a significant effect on head and neck injury parameters, and anterolateral impact is the most risky impact location for both head and neck. The maximum average rotational acceleration is for anterolateral eccentric impact which is 4.75 times more than the average anterior central impact. The lateral impacts generate about 10% more linear accelerations than anterior and posterior impacts. Neck forces do not vary more than 20% with impact locations and neck strength. The average head and neck injury parameters do not vary more than 10% based on neck strength. Impact characteristics have a significant role in GAMBIT and NIC. The average GAMBIT for IVI and HVI were 1.44 and 1.54 times higher than LVI. In summary, the anterolateral eccentric impact has a higher probability of head and neck injury than the other six impact locations. These findings provide objective evidence that can inform injury prevention strategies as well as aid tissue and cellular level studies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Transcriptional Activation by Corticosteroids of Human MR (Ile-180) and Human MR Haplotype (Ile180Val)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the classical function of human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is to regulate sodium and potassium homeostasis through aldosterone activation of the kidney MR, the MR also is highly expressed in the brain, where the MR is activated by cortisol in response to stress. Here, we report the half-maximal response (EC50) and fold-activation by cortisol, aldosterone and other corticosteroids of human MR rs5522, a haplotype containing valine at codon 180 instead of isoleucine found in the wild-type MR (Ile-180). MR rs5522 (Val-180) has been studied for its actions in the human brain involving coping with stress and depression. We compared the EC50 and fold-activation by corticosteroids of MR rs5522 and wild-type MR transfected into HEK293 cells with either the TAT3 promoter or the MMTV promoter. Parallel studies investigated the binding of MR antagonists, spironolactone and progesterone, to MR rs5522. In HEK293 cells with the MMTV promotor, MR rs5522 had a slightly higher EC50 compared to wild-type MR and a similar level of fold-activation for all corticosteroids. In contrast, in HEK293 cells with the TAT3 promoter, MR 5522 had a higher EC50 (lower affinity) and higher fold-activation for cortisol compared to wild-type MR (Ile-180), while compared to wild-type MR, the EC50s of MR rs5522 for aldosterone and corticosterone were slightly lower and fold-activation was higher. Spironolactone and progesterone had similar antagonist activity for MR rs5522 and MR (Ile-180) in the presence of MMTV and TAT3 promoters in HEK293 cells.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of the glycoprotein pherophorin II reveals stochastic geometry of the growing ECM of $Volvox~carteri$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of multicellularity involved the transformation of a simple cell wall of unicellular ancestors into a complex, multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM). A suitable model organism to study the formation and expansion of an ECM during ontogenesis is the multicellular green alga $Volvox~carteri$, which, along with the related volvocine algae, produces a complex, self-organized ECM composed of multiple substructures. These self-assembled ECMs primarily consist of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, a major component of which is pherophorins. To investigate the geometry of the growing ECM, we fused the $yfp$ gene with the gene for pherophorin II (PhII) in $V.~carteri$. Confocal microscopy reveals PhII:YFP localization at key structures within the ECM, including the boundaries of compartments surrounding each somatic cell and the outer surface of the organism. Image analysis during the life cycle allows the stochastic geometry of those growing compartments to be quantified. We find that their areas and aspect ratios exhibit robust gamma distributions and exhibit a transition from a tight polygonal to a looser acircular packing geometry with stable eccentricity over time, evoking parallels and distinctions with the behavior of hydrated foams. These results provide a quantitative benchmark for addressing a general, open question in biology: How do cells produce structures external to themselves in a robust and accurate manner?</description>
