      <title>Catalog of variable stars in the WD 0009+501 and GRW +708247 fields based on photometric survey data on transiting exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 150 variable stars, including 13 stars with exoplanet candidates. 37 stars were identified as variables for the first time. As a result of a 2.5-year photometric survey of exoplanets, we have obtained and analyzed light curves for almost 50 thousand stars in fields around white dwarfs WD 0009+501 and GRW +708247. Here we describe observations and data processing, the search for variable stars, their cross-identification with other catalogs and classification. The catalog is published in open access and contains the primary classification of variability, light curves and their parameters.</description>

      <title>Deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Supernova 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam obtained high angular-resolution (0.05-0.1''), deep near-infrared 1--5 micron imaging of Supernova (SN) 1987A taken 35 years after the explosion. In the NIRCam images, we identify: 1) faint H2 crescents, which are emissions located between the ejecta and the equatorial ring, 2) a bar, which is a substructure of the ejecta, and 3) the bright 3-5 micron continuum emission exterior to the equatorial ring. The emission of the remnant in the NIRCam 1-2.3 micron images is mostly due to line emission, which is mostly emitted in the ejecta and in the hot spots within the equatorial ring. In contrast, the NIRCam 3-5 micron images are dominated by continuum emission. In the ejecta, the continuum is due to dust, obscuring the centre of the ejecta. In contrast, in the ring and exterior to the ring, synchrotron emission contributes a substantial fraction to the continuum.
  Dust emission contributes to the continuum at outer spots and diffuse emission exterior to the ring, but little within the ring. This shows that dust cooling and destruction time scales are shorter than the synchrotron cooling time scale, and the time scale of hydrogen recombination in the ring is even longer than the synchrotron cooling time scale.
  With the advent of high sensitivity and high angular resolution images provided by JWST/NIRCam, our observations of SN 1987A demonstrate that NIRCam opens up a window to study particle-acceleration and shock physics in unprecedented details, probed by near-infrared synchrotron emission, building a precise picture of how a SN evolves.</description>

      <title>Using ZDI maps to determine magnetic forces and torques at the photospheres of Early-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the magnetic field components measured by Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) to calculate the stellar surface force and torque due to magnetic stresses for the fast rotators $\sigma$ Ori E, 36 Lyn and CU Vir, and the slow rotator $\tau$ Sco. If we assume the stars have spherical photospheres, the estimated torques give spin down time scales no larger than $7 \times 10^5$ yr. For $\sigma$ Ori E, the predicted spin down time scale, $\simeq 6000$ yr, is much less than the observationally measured time scale of $\simeq 10^6$ yr. However, for CU Vir, we find that the spin down time scale from its ZDI map is $7 \times 10^5$ yr in good agreement with its average rate of spin down from 1960 to 2010.
  With the exception of $\tau$ Sco, the net force due to magnetic stresses at the stellar surface are large compared to the surface-integrated pressure. We discuss possible reasons for the large values of the forces (and torques), and suggest that the likely explanation is that rotation and the magnetic stresses create significant departures from spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>A magnetic massive star has experienced a stellar merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars (those larger than 8 solar masses at formation) have radiative envelopes that cannot sustain a dynamo, the mechanism that produces magnetic fields in lower-mass stars. Despite this, approximately 7\% of massive stars have observed magnetic fields, the origin of which is debated. We used multi-epoch interferometric and spectroscopic observations to characterize HD 148937, a binary system of two massive stars. We found that only one star is magnetic and that it appears younger than its companion. The system properties and a surrounding bipolar nebula can be reproduced with a model in which two stars merged (in a previous triple system) to produce the magnetic massive star. Our results provide observational evidence that magnetic fields form in at least some massive stars through stellar mergers.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary Disk Polarization at Multiple Wavelengths: Are Dust Populations Diverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter and sub-millimeter observations of continuum linear dust polarization provide insight into dust grain growth in protoplanetary disks, which are the progenitors of planetary systems. We present the results of the first survey of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks at 870 $\mu$m and 3 mm. We find that protoplanetary disks in the same molecular cloud at similar evolutionary stages can exhibit different correlations between observing wavelength and polarization morphology and fraction. We explore possible origins for these differences in polarization, including differences in dust populations and protostar properties. For RY Tau and MWC 480, which are consistent with scattering at both wavelengths, we present models of the scattering polarization from several dust grain size distributions. These models aim to reproduce two features of the observational results for these disks: (1) both disks have an observable degree of polarization at both wavelengths and (2) the polarization fraction is higher at 3 mm than at 870 $\mu$m in the centers of the disks. For both disks, these features can be reproduced by a power-law distribution of spherical dust grains with a maximum radius of 200 $\mu$m and high optical depth. In MWC 480, we can also reproduce features (1) and (2) with a model containing large grains ($a_{max}$ = 490 $\mu$m ) near the disk midplane and small grains ($a_{max}$ = 140 $\mu$m) above and below the midplane.</description>

      <title>Study of the Balmer decrements for Galactic classical Be stars using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope of India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, Banerjee et al. (2021) produced an atlas of all major emission lines found in a large sample of 115 Galactic field Be stars using the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) facility located at Ladakh, India. This paper presents our further exploration of these stars to estimate the electron density in their discs. Our study using Balmer decrement values indicate that their discs are generally optically thick in nature with electron density (n_e) in their circumstellar envelopes (CEs) being in excess of 10^13 cm^-3 for around 65% of the stars. For another 19% stars, the average n_e in their discs probably range between 10^12 cm^-3 and 10^13 cm^-3. We noticed that the nature of the H{\alpha} and H\b{eta} line profiles might not influence the observed Balmer decrement values (i.e. D_34 and D_54) of the sample of stars. Interestingly, we also found that around 50% of the Be stars displaying D_34 greater than 2.7 are of earlier spectral types, i.e. within B0 -B3.</description>

      <title>Effect of Systematic Uncertainties on Density and Temperature Estimates in Coronae of Capella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O VII and Fe XVII line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic-Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully-Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A $t$-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe XVII spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O VII spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of $\approx$5 MK and a coronal plasma density of $\approx$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex respectively.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of solar models with high-metallicity abundances and updated opacity tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high quality constraints available for the Sun, we can carry out combined analyses using neutrino, spectroscopic and helioseismic observations. Such studies lay the ground for future improvements of key physical components of solar and stellar models, such as the equation of state, radiative opacities or prescriptions for macroscopic transport processes of chemicals which are then used to study other stars in the Universe. We study the existing degeneracies in solar models using the recent high-metallicity spectroscopic abundances by comparing them to helioseismic and neutrino data and discuss how their properties are impacted by changes in various physical ingredients. We carry out a detailed study of solar models computed with a high-metallicity composition from the literature based on averaged-3D models that was claimed to solve the solar problem. The properties of the solar models are significantly affected by using the recent OPLIB opacities and the inclusion of macroscopic transport. The properties of the standard solar models computed using the OPAL opacities are similar to those using the OP opacities. We show that a modifying the temperature gradient just below the base of the convective zone is required to erase the discrepancies in solar models, particularly in the presence of macroscopic mixing. This can be simulated by a local increase of opacity of a few percent. We conclude that the existing degeneracies and issues in solar modelling are not erased by an increase in the solar metallicity in contradiction to was suggested in recent papers. Therefore, standard solar models cannot be used as an argument for a high metallicity composition. While further work is required to improve solar models, we note that direct helioseismic inversions indicate a low metallicity in the convective envelope, in agreement with spectroscopic analyses based on full 3D models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Evolution of an Active Region Producing Successive Flares and Confined Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the magnetic evolution of solar active region (AR) NOAA 11476 that, between 9 and 10 May 2012, produced a series of surge-type eruptions accompanied by GOES X-ray class M flares. Using force-free models of the AR coronal structure and observations in several wavelengths, in previous works we studied the detailed evolution of those eruptions, relating them to the characteristic magnetic topology of the AR and reconstructing the involved reconnection scheme. We found that the eruptions were due to the ejection of minifilaments, which were recurrently ejected and reformed at the polarity inversion line of a bipole that emerged in the middle of the positive main AR magnetic polarity. The bipole was observed to rotate for several tens of hours before the events. In this article we analyze, for the full AR and the rotating bipole, the evolution of a series of magnetic parameters computed using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) vector magnetograms. We combine this analysis with estimations of the injection of magnetic energy and helicity obtained using the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) method that determines, from vector magnetograms, the affine velocity field constrained by the induction equation. From our results, we conclude that the bipole rotation was the main driver that provided the magnetic energy and helicity involved in the minifilament destabilizations and ejections. The results also suggest that the observed rotation is probably due to the emergence of a kinked magnetic flux rope with negative writhe helicity.</description>

      <title>Variabilities in the polar field and solar cycle due to irregular properties of Bipolar Magnetic Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay and dispersal of the tilted Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) on the solar surface are observed to produce large-scale poloidal field, which acts as the seed for the toroidal field and, thus, the next sunspot cycle. However, various properties of BMR, namely, the tilt, time delay between successive emergences, location, and flux, all have irregular variations. Previous studies show that these variations can lead to changes in the polar field. In this study, we first demonstrate that our 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, reproduces the robust feature of the surface flux transport (SFT) model, namely the variation of the generated dipole moment with the latitude of the BMR position. Using STABLE in both SFT and dynamo modes, we perform simulations by varying the individual properties of BMR and keeping their distributions the same in all the cycles as inspired by the observations. We find that randomness due to the distribution in either the time delay or the BMR latitude produces negligible variation in the polar field and the solar cycle. However, randomness due to BMR flux distribution produces substantial effects, while the scatter in the tilt around Joy law produces the largest variation. Our comparative analyses suggest that the scatter of BMR tilt around Joy law is the major cause of variation in the solar cycle. Furthermore, our simulations also show that the magnetic field-dependent time delay of BMR emergence produces more realistic features of the magnetic cycle, consistent with observation.</description>

      <title>Observations of Fan-Spine Topology by Solar Orbiter/EUI: Rotational Motions and Indications of Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Torsional Alfv\'en waves do not produce any intensity variation and are, therefore, challenging to observe with imaging instruments. Previously, Alfv\'en wave observations were reported throughout all the layers of the solar atmosphere using spectral imaging. We present an observation of a torsional Alfv\'en wave detected in an inverted y-shape structure observed with the HRIEUV telescope of the EUI instrument onboard Solar Orbiter in its 174 \r{A} channel. The feature consists of two footpoints connected through short loops and a spine with a length of 30 Mm originating from one of the footpoints. In the current work, we also make use of the simultaneous observations from two other instruments onboard Solar Orbiter. The first one is PHI that is used to derive the magnetic configuration of the observed feature. The second one is SPICE that provided observations of intensity maps in different lines including Ne VIII and C III lines. We also address the issues of the SPICE point spread function and its influence on the Doppler maps via performed forward modeling analysis. The difference movie shows clear signatures of propagating rotational motions in the spine. Doppler maps obtained with SPICE show strong signal in the spine region. Under the assumption that the recovered point spread function is mostly correct, synthesized raster images confirm that this signal is predominantly physical. We conclude that the presented observations are compatible with an interpretation of either propagating torsional Alfv\'en waves in a low coronal structure or untwisting of a flux rope. This is the first time we see signatures of propagating torsional motion in corona as observed by the three instruments onboard Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of V583 Lyrae, an Algol with a g-mode Pulsating Primary and Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V583 Lyr is an extremely low mass ratio Algol-type binary with an orbital period of 11.2580 days. We determined an effective temperature of T_{eff1} = 9000 \pm 350 K from newly observed spectra, which might be an underestimate due to binary mass transfer. The binary mass ratio q = 0.1 \pm 0.004 and the orbital inclination i = 85.5{\deg} are determined based on the assumption that the secondary fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously. The radial velocity curve is obtained from time series spectra, allowing for improved estimation of stellar masses and radii: M1 = 3.56 \pm 0.5 Msun, R1 = 2.4 \pm 0.2 Rsun; and M2 = 0.36 \pm 0.02 Msun, R2= 6.9 \pm 0.4 Rsun. The variations in the double-peaked H_{\alpha} emission indicate the formation of a stable disk during mass transfer. V583 Lyr appears to be a post-mass-reversal system, according to the estimated mass transfer using O-C period analysis. Its orbital period is slowly increasing, from which the rate of mass accretion by the primary star is estimated to be dM1/dt = 3.384 \times10^{-8} Msun/yr. The pulsation analysis was conducted on the residuals of the light curve. The primary component was found to be a g-mode pulsating star with 26 frequencies extracted lower than 9 d^{-1}. The frequency groups and rotational splitting properties of the g-mode were studied in detail. This study provides compelling evidence for an accretion disk surrounding the g-mode pulsating primary.</description>

      <title>Dependence of spicule properties on magnetic field - results from Magnetohydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar spicules are plasma jets observed in the interface region between the visible solar surface and the corona. At any given time, there are millions of spicules present all over the Sun. While various models attempt to elucidate their origin and characteristics, here, we consider the one driven by the magneto-convection undulations. The radiative magneto-hydrodynamical (rMHD) equations are solved using PENCIL CODE with a spatial resolution of 16 km using various magnetic field strengths. The obtained rMHD simulation data are investigated to unveil the various trends in spicular properties as function of the applied magnetic fields. The important outcome of this study is the finding of a consistent reduction in both the number density and the maximum height reached by spicules as magnetic field strength increases. We also use parabolic fitting on time-distance curves of spicules that are taller than $75^\mathrm{th}$ percentile in the distribution, in order to find a relation between deceleration of the spicule tip and the magnetic field strength. Our results offer insights into the response of solar spicules to magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the Einstein Telescope: a machine-learning approach</title>

Abstract: Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to $z\sim 100$. However, unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift sources will remain uncertain, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs, specifically differentiating those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars - likely the first progenitors of stellar-born BBH mergers in the Universe - and those originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We have considered a wide range of state-of-the-art models encompassing current uncertainties on Pop. III BBH mergers. We then estimate parameter errors of detected sources with ET using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism, followed by classification using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial model, we accurately identify ~10% of detected BBHs originating from Pop. III stars with &gt; 90% precision. Our study demonstrates how machine learning enables to achieve some pivotal aspects of ET science case by exploring the origin of individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies, which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for population modeling uncertainties</description>

      <title>The Rise of the $R$-Process in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) produce copious amounts of heavy r-process elements after a time delayed inspiral process. Once NSMs are present in a galaxy, r-process elements, such as Eu, are expected to significantly increase with time. Yet, there has been limited observational data in support of Eu increasing within Local Group galaxies. We have obtained high-resolution Magellan/MIKE observations of 43 metal-poor stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus tidally disrupted galaxy with $-2.5 &lt; \rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1$. For the first time, we find a clear rise in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Mg/H] within one galaxy. We use a chemical evolution model to study how such a rise can result from the interplay of prompt and delayed r-process enrichment events. Delayed r-process sources are required to explain the rise and subsequent leveling off of [Eu/Mg] in this disrupted galaxy. However, the rise may be explained by delayed r-process sources with either short ($\sim 10$ Myr) or long ($\sim 500$ Myr) minimum delay times. Future studies on the nature of r-process sources and their enrichment processes in the GSE will require additional stars in the GSE at even lower metallicities than the present study.</description>

      <title>Inclination instability of circumbinary planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a tilt instability of the orbit of an outer planet in a two planet circumbinary system that we recently reported. The binary is on an eccentric orbit and the inner circumbinary planet is on a circular polar orbit that causes the the binary to undergo apsidal precession. The outer circumbinary planet is initially on a circular or eccentric orbit that is coplanar with respect to the binary. We apply a Hamiltonian in quadrupole order of the binary potential to show that the tilt instability is the result of a secular resonance in which the apsidal precession rate of the binary matches the nodal precession rate of the outer planet. Resonance is possible because the polar inner planet causes the apsidal precession of the binary to be retrograde. The outer planet periodically undergoes large tilt oscillations for which we analytically determine the initial evolution and maximum inclination. Following a typically relatively short adjustment phase, the tilt grows exponentially in time at a characteristic rate that is of order the absolute value of the binary apsidal precession rate. The analytic results agree well with numerical simulations. This instability is analogous to the Kozai-Lidov instability, but applied to a circumbinary object. The instability fails to operate if the binary mass ratio is too extreme. The instability occurs even if the outer planet is instead an object of stellar mass and involves tilt oscillations of the inner binary.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XIV: On the high linearly polarized pulsar signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The S-shaped swing of the linear polarization position angle (PPA) observed in many pulsars can be interpreted by the rotating vector model (RVM). However, efforts to fit the RVM for a large sample of pulsars observed with the MeerKAT telescope as a part of the Thousand-Pulsar-Array (TPA) programme, only succeeded for about half the cases. High time-resolution studies suggest that the failed cases arise due to the presence of orthogonal polarization modes, or highly disordered distribution of PPA points. One such example is PSR~J1645-0317. Recently it has been shown that the RVM can be recovered in this pulsar by using only time samples which are greater than 80% linearly polarized. In this work we test this novel approach on the brightest 249 pulsars from the TPA sample, of which 177 yield sufficient highly polarized samples to be amenable to our method. Remarkably, only 9 of these pulsars (5%) now fail to fit the RVM as opposed to 59% from the original analysis. This result favours the paradigm that the underlying mechanism is coherent curvature radiation.</description>

      <title>Membership determination in open clusters using the DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the machine learning clustering algorithm Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to study the membership of stars in twelve open clusters (NGC~2264, NGC~2682, NGC~2244, NGC~3293, NGC~6913, NGC~7142, IC~1805, NGC~6231, NGC~2243, NGC 6451, NGC 6005 and NGC 6583) based on Gaia DR3 Data. This sample of clusters spans a variety of parameters like age, metallicity, distance, extinction and a wide parameter space in proper motions and parallaxes. We obtain reliable cluster members using DBSCAN as faint as $G \sim 20$ mag and also in the outer regions of clusters. With our revised membership list, we plot color-magnitude diagrams and we obtain cluster parameters for our sample using ASteCA and compare it with the catalog values. We also validate our membership sample by spectroscopic data from APOGEE and GALAH for the available data. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DBSCAN in membership determination of clusters.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dormant 33 solar-mass black hole in pre-release Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \pm 0.82 M\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Early-time gamma-ray constraints on cosmic-ray acceleration in the core-collapse SN 2023ixf with the Fermi Large Area Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10487</link>

Abstract: While SNRs have been considered the most relevant Galactic CR accelerators for decades, CCSNe could accelerate particles during the earliest stages of their evolution and hence contribute to the CR energy budget in the Galaxy. Some SNRs have indeed been associated with TeV gamma-rays, yet proton acceleration efficiency during the early stages of an SN expansion remains mostly unconstrained. The multi-wavelength observation of SN 2023ixf, a Type II SN in the nearby galaxy M101, opens the possibility to constrain CR acceleration within a few days after the collapse of the RSG stellar progenitor. With this work, we intend to provide a phenomenological, quasi-model-independent constraint on the CR acceleration efficiency during this event at photon energies above 100 MeV. We performed a maximum-likelihood analysis of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope up to one month after the SN explosion. We searched for high-energy emission from its expanding shock, and estimated the underlying hadronic CR energy reservoir assuming a power-law proton distribution consistent with standard diffusive shock acceleration. We do not find significant gamma-ray emission from SN 2023ixf. Nonetheless, our non-detection provides the first limit on the energy transferred to the population of hadronic CRs during the very early expansion of a CCSN. Under reasonable assumptions, our limits would imply a maximum efficiency on the CR acceleration of as low as 1%, which is inconsistent with the common estimate of 10% in generic SNe. However, this result is highly dependent on the assumed geometry of the circumstellar medium, and could be relaxed back to 10% by challenging spherical symmetry. A more sophisticated, inhomogeneous characterisation of the shock and the progenitor's environment is required before establishing whether or not Type II SNe are indeed efficient CR accelerators at early times.</description>

      <title>Impacts of stellar wind and supernovae on the star cluster formation: origins of extremely high N/O ratios and multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study metal enrichment originating from stellar wind and supernovae in low-metallicity clouds by performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\rm [N/O]}\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters. We suggest that the mass of the star cluster needs to exceed $\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$ to have multiple populations due to stellar wind, considering the condition for massive star cluster formation and the timescales of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this {\em Letter}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic signals. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the inferred event rate densities of GW230529-like mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers, as well as the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Thus, we conclude that the recently-discovered mgBHNS merger, GW230529, can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the equation of states of AP4 and DD2, the probabilities that GW230529 can make tidal disruption are $12.8\%$ and $63.2\%$, respectively. If GW230529 is a disrupted event, the associated kilonova is predicted to have an apparent magnitude of $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. The detection of GW230529 confirms the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel, suggesting that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim60\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>

      <title>The XUV-driven escape of the planets around TOI-431 &amp; $\nu^2$ Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the leading mechanisms invoked to explain the existence of the radius valley is atmospheric mass loss driven by X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet irradiation, with this process stripping the primordial envelopes of young, small planets to produce the observed bimodal distribution. We present an investigation into the TOI-431 and $\nu^2$ Lupi planetary systems, both of which host planets either side of the radius valley, to determine if their architectures are consistent with evolution by the XUV mechanism. With $\textit{XMM-Newton}$, we measure the current X-ray flux of each star, and see evidence for a stellar flare in the TOI-431 observations. We then simulate the evolution of all of the transiting planets across the two systems in response to the high-energy irradiation over their lifetimes. We use the measured X-ray fluxes as an anchor point for the XUV time evolution in our simulations, and employ several different models of estimating mass loss rates. While the simulations for TOI-431b encountered a problem with the initial calculated radii, we estimate a likely short ($\sim$ Myr) timespan for primordial envelope removal using reasonable assumptions for the initial planet. $\nu^2$ Lupi b is likely harder to strip, but is achieved in a moderate fraction of our simulations. None of our simulations stripped any of the lower density planets of their envelope, in line with prediction. We conclude that both systems are consistent with expectations for generation of the radius valley through XUV photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>Maser Flares Driven by Isothermal Shock Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use 3D computer modelling to investigate the timescales and radiative output from maser flares generated by the impact of shock-waves on astronomical unit-scale clouds in interstellar and star-forming regions, and in circumstellar regions in some circumstances. Physical conditions are derived from simple models of isothermal hydrodynamic (single-fluid) and C-type (ionic and neutral fluid) shock-waves, and based on the ortho-H$_2$O 22-GHz transition. Maser saturation is comprehensively included, and we find that the most saturated maser inversions are found predominantly in the shocked material. We study the effect on the intensity, flux density and duration of flares of the following parameters: the pre-shock level of saturation, the observer's viewpoint, and the shock speed. Our models are able to reproduce observed flare rise times of a few times 10 days, specific intensities of up to 10$^5$ times the saturation intensity and flux densities of order $100(R/d)^2$Jy from a source of radius $R$ astronomical units at a distance of $d$ kiloparsec. We found that flares from C-type shocks are approximately 5 times more likely to be seen by a randomly placed observer than flares from hydrodynamically shocked clouds of similar dimensions. We computed intrinsic beaming patterns of the maser emission, finding substantial extension of the pattern parallel to the shock front in the hydrodynamic models. Beaming solid angles for hydrodynamic models can be as small as $1.3\times 10^{-5}$sr, but are an order of magnitude larger for C-type models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and LLM-based Methods Applied to Stellar Lightcurve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from SN 1181 hosting a white dwarf merger product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remnant of the historical supernova 1181 is claimed to be associated with a white dwarf merger remnant J005311. The supernova remnant (SNR) shock, and a termination shock expected to be formed by the intense wind of J005311, are potential sites for radio emission via synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. In this paper, we estimate the radio emission from these two shocks, and find the peak radio flux to be 0.1--10 mJy (at 0.01--1 GHz) in the outer SNR shock and 0.01--0.1 mJy (at 1--10 GHz) in the inner termination shock. We also search for radio emission from this source in the archival data of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey at 3 GHz, NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz and the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey at 408 MHz, resulting in no significant detection. While targeted observations with higher sensitivity are desired, we particularly encourage those at higher frequency and angular resolution to probe the inner termination shock and its evolution.</description>

      <title>A simple method to measure numax for asteroseismology: application to 16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of numax (the frequency of maximum oscillation power) for asteroseismology has been demonstrated widely in the previous decade, especially for red giants. With the large amount of photometric data from CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, several automated algorithms to retrieve numax values have been introduced. Most of these algorithms correct the granulation background in the power spectrum by fitting a model and subtracting it before measuring numax. We have developed a method that does not require fitting to the granulation background. Instead, we simply divide the power spectrum by a function of the form nu^-2, to remove the slope due to granulation background, and then smooth to measure numax. This method is fast, simple and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting. The method is able to measure oscillations in 99.9% of previously-studied Kepler red giants, with a systematic offset of 1.5 % in numax values that that we are able to calibrate. On comparing the seismic radii from this work with Gaia, we see similar trends to those observed in previous studies. Additionally, our values of width of the power envelope can clearly identify the dipole mode suppressed stars as a distinct population, hence as a way to detect them. We also applied our method to stars with low (0.19--18.35 muHz) and found it works well to correctly identify the oscillations.</description>

      <title>A $1.9\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star candidate in a 2-year orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report discovery and characterization of a main-sequence G star orbiting a dark object with mass $1.90\pm 0.04 M_{\odot}$. The system was discovered via Gaia astrometry and has an orbital period of 731 days. We obtained multi-epoch RV follow-up over a period of 639 days, allowing us to refine the Gaia orbital solution and precisely constrain the masses of both components. The luminous star is a $\gtrsim 12$ Gyr-old, low-metallicity halo star near the main-sequence turnoff ($T_{\rm eff}\approx 6000$ K; $\log(g/\left[{\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right])\approx 4.0$; $\rm [Fe/H]\approx-1.25$; $M\approx0.79 M_{\odot}$) with a highly enhanced lithium abundance. The RV mass function sets a minimum companion mass for an edge-on orbit of $M_2 &gt; 1.67 M_{\odot}$, well above the Chandrasekhar limit. The Gaia inclination constraint, $i=68.7\pm 1.4$ deg, then implies a companion mass of $M_2=1.90\pm0.04 M_{\odot}$. The companion is most likely a massive neutron star: the only viable alternative is two massive white dwarfs in a close binary, but this scenario is disfavored on evolutionary grounds. The system's low eccentricity ($e=0.122\pm 0.002$) disfavors dynamical formation channels and implies that the neutron star likely formed with little mass loss ($\lesssim1\,M_{\odot}$) and with a weak natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 20\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$). The current orbit is too small to have accommodated the neutron star progenitor as a red supergiant or super-AGB star. The simplest formation scenario -- isolated binary evolution -- requires the system to have survived unstable mass transfer and common envelope evolution with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $&gt;10$. The system, which we call Gaia NS1, is likely a progenitor of symbiotic X-ray binaries and long-period millisecond pulsars. Its discovery challenges binary evolution models and bodes well for Gaia's census of compact objects in wide binaries.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LI: A Variability Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs with Planets from Months to Decades with TESS and the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the optical photometric variability of 32 planet-hosting M dwarfs within 25 parsecs over timescales of months to decades. The primary goal of this project, ATLAS -- A Trail to Life Around Stars, is to follow the trail to life by revealing nearby M dwarfs with planets that are also "quiet", which may make them more amiable to habitability. There are 69 reported exoplanets orbiting the 32 stars discussed here, providing a rich sample of worlds for which environmental evaluations are needed. We examine the optical flux environments of these planets over month-long timescales for 23 stars observed by TESS, and find that 17 vary by less than 1% ($\sim$11 mmag). All 32 stars are being observed at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m, with a median duration of 19.1 years of optical photometric data in the $VRI$ bands. We find over these extended timescales that six stars show optical flux variations less than 2%, 25 vary from 2--6% ($\sim$22-67 mmag), and only one, Proxima Centauri, varies by more than 6%. Overall, LHS 1678 exhibits the lowest optical variability levels measured over all timescales examined, thereby providing one of the most stable photometric environments among planets reported around M dwarfs within 25 parsecs. More than 600 of the nearest M dwarfs are being observed at the 0.9 m in the RECONS program that began in 1999, and many more planet hosts will undoubtedly be revealed, providing more destinations to be added to the ATLAS sample in the future.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Content of the Young Open Cluster Berkeley 50 (IC 1310)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed the Galactic open cluster Berkeley 50 in order to determine its stellar content, distance, and age. We obtained UBV photometry of 1145 stars in a 12.3' $\times$ 12.3' field, and used Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to identify 64 members, of which we obtained spectra of the 17 brightest members. The majority of the observed population we classified as B dwarfs, with the exception of a newly identified red supergiant star, which our spectroscopy shows has a B-type companion. Our study establishes the distance as 3.8 kpc, with an average color-excess $E(B-V)=0.9$. Comparison of the physical properties of the cluster with the Geneva evolutionary tracks places the age of the cluster as 50-60 Myr, with its most massive members being $\sim7M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) VIII: Characterising the orbital properties of the ancient, very metal-poor inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oldest stars in the Milky Way (born in the first few billion years) are expected to have a high density in the inner few kpc, spatially overlapping with the Galactic bulge. We use spectroscopic data from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) to study the dynamical properties of ancient, metal-poor inner Galaxy stars. We compute distances using StarHorse, and orbital properties in a barred Galactic potential. With this paper, we release the spectroscopic AAT/PIGS catalogue (13 235 stars). We find that most PIGS stars have orbits typical for a pressure-supported population. The fraction of stars confined to the inner Galaxy decreases with decreasing metallicity, but many very metal-poor stars (VMP, [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0) stay confined (~ 60% stay within 5 kpc). The azimuthal velocity v$_\phi$ also decreases between [Fe/H] = -1.0 and -2.0, but is constant for VMP stars (at ~ 40 km/s). The carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in PIGS appear to have similar orbital properties compared to normal VMP stars. Our results suggest a possible transition between two spheroidal components - a more metal-rich, more concentrated, faster rotating component, and a more metal-poor, more extended and slower/non-rotating component. We propose that the former may be connected to pre-disc in-situ stars (or those born in large building blocks), whereas the latter may be dominated by contributions from smaller galaxies. This is an exciting era where large metal-poor samples, such as in this work (as well as upcoming surveys, e.g., 4MOST), shed light on the earliest evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1-10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5-7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>
