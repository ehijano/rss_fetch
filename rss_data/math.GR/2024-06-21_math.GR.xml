      <title>Hyperbolic actions of Thompson's group $F$ and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the poset of hyperbolic structures on Thompson's group $F$ and its generalizations $F_n$ for $n \geq 2$. The global structure of this poset is as simple as one would expect, with the maximal non-elementary elements being two quasi-parabolic actions corresponding to well-known ascending HNN-extension expressions of $F_n$. However, the local structure turns out to be incredibly rich, in stark contrast with the situation for the $T$ and $V$ counterparts. We show that the subposet of quasi-parabolic hyperbolic structures consists of two isomorphic posets, each of which contains uncountably many subposets of \emph{lamplike} structures, which can be described combinatorially in terms of certain hyperbolic structures on related lamplighter groups. Moreover, each of these subposets, as well as intersections and complements thereof, is very large, in that it contains a copy of the power set of the natural numbers. We also prove that these uncountably many uncountable subposets are not the entire picture, indeed there exists a copy of the power set of the natural numbers consisting entirely of non-lamplike structures. We also prove that this entire vast array of hyperbolic structures on $F_n$ collapses as soon as one takes a natural semidirect product with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. These results are all proved via a detailed analysis of confining subsets, and along the way we establish a number of fundamental results in the theory of confining subsets of groups.</description>

      <title>IBIS primitive groups of almost simple type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group on $\Omega$. An ordered sequence
  $(\omega_1\ldots,\omega_\ell)$ of elements of $\Omega$ is an irredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer is trivial and no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. The minimal cardinality of a base is said to be the base size of $G$. If all irredundant bases of $G$ have the same cardinality, $G$ is said to be an IBIS group.
  In this paper, we classify the finite almost simple primitive IBIS groups whose base size is at least $6$.</description>

      <title>Distortion in groups of generalized piecewise-linear transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each natural number $n$, we consider the subgroup $\mathcal{R}_n$ of Homeo$_+[0,1]$ made by the elements that are linear except for a subset whose Cantor-Bendixson rank is less than or equal to $n$. These groups of generalized piecewise-linear transformations yield an ascending chain of groups as we increase $n$. We study how the notion of distorted element changes along this chain. Our main result establishes that for each natural number $n$, there exits an element that is undistorted of $\mathcal{R}_n$ yet distorted in $\mathcal{R}_{n+1}$. Actually, such an element is explicitly constructed.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of free metabelian Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every automorphism of a free metabelian Lie algebra $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over an arbitrary field $K$ is almost tame, that is, it is a product of so-called Chein automorphisms (or one-row transformations). Moreover, we show that the group of all automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}(M_n)$ of $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 3$ is generated by all linear automorphisms, as well as one quadratic and one cubic automorphism. The same result holds for fields of any characteristic if $n\geq 5$.
  We also show that all Chein automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 4$ and all exponential automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 5$ are tame, which contradicts the results of \cite{BN,OE}.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Symplectic Automorphisms of Supersingular K3 surfaces in Odd Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Dolgachev-Keum classify finite groups of tame symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces in positive characteristics. They show all such groups are subgroups of the Mathieu group of degree 23. In this paper, we utilize lattice-theoretic methods to investigate symplectic actions of finite groups G on K3 surfaces in odd characteristics. In the tame cases (i.e., the order of G is coprime with p) and all the superspecial cases, one can associate with the action a Leech pair which can be detected via H\"ohn-Mason's list. Notice that the superspecial case has been recently resolved by Ohashi-Sch\"utt. If the K3 surface is supersingular with Artin invariant at least two, we develop a new machinery called p-root pairs to detect possible symplectic finite group actions (without the assumption of tameness). The concept of p-root pair is closely related to root systems and Weyl groups. In particular, we recover many results by Dolgachev-Keum with a different method and give an upper bound for the exponent of p in |G|.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm that, given a prime $p$ as input, determines whether or not the Burau representation of the 3-strand braid group modulo $p$ is faithful. We also prove that the representation is indeed faithful when $p\le 13$. Additionally, we re-pose Salter's question on the Burau representation of $B_3$ over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$, and solve it for every $p$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new family of groups, called Chambord groups and constructed from braided strand diagrams associated to specific semigroup presentations. It includes the asymptotically rigid mapping class groups previously studied by the authors such as the braided Higman-Thompson groups and the braided Houghton groups. Our main result shows that polycyclic subgroups in Chambord groups are virtually abelian and undistorted.</description>

      <title>Determining skew left braces of size np</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the twofold semidirect product of two skew left braces, in which both the additive and multiplicative groups are semidirect products of the corresponding groups of the given skew left braces. We consider an odd prime $p$ and an integer $n$ satisfying $p\nmid n$, $p\nmid|\mathrm{Aut}(E)|$ for every group $E$ of order $n$ and such that each group of order $np$ has a unique $p$-Sylow subgroup. Under these conditions, we prove that any skew left brace of size $np$ is either a twofold semidirect product of the trivial brace of size $p$ and a skew brace of size $n$ or a companion skew brace of that one. We develop an algorithm to obtain all skew braces of size $np$ from the braces of size $n$ and provide a formula to count them. We use this result to describe all braces of size $12p$ for $p\geq 7$, which proves a conjecture of V.G. Bardakov, M.V. Neshchadim and M.K. Yadav.</description>

Abstract: We study random walks on the lampshuffler group $\mathrm{FSym}(H)\rtimes H$, where $H$ is a finitely generated group and $\mathrm{FSym}(H)$ is the group of finitary permutations of $H$. We show that for any step distribution $\mu$ with a finite first moment that induces a transient random walk on $H$, the permutation coordinate of the random walk almost surely stabilizes pointwise. Our main result states that for $H=\mathbb{Z}$, the above convergence completely describes the Poisson boundary of the random walk $(\mathrm{FSym}(\mathbb{Z})\rtimes \mathbb{Z},\mu)$.</description>

Abstract: For all Zarski dense Anosov subgroups of a semisimple real algebraic group, we prove that their limit sets are Ahlfors regular for intrinsic conformal premetrics. As a consequence, we obtain that a Patterson-Sullivan measure is equal to the Hausdorff measure if and only if the associated linear form is symmetric. We also discuss several applications, including analyticity of $(p,q)$-Hausdorff dimensions on the Teichm\"uller spaces, new upper bounds on the growth indicator, and $L^2$-spectral properties of associated locally symmetric manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Lie group analog for the Monster Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Monster Lie algebra $\frak m $, which admits an action of the Monster finite simple group $\mathbb{M}$, was introduced by Borcherds as part of his work on the Conway--Norton Monstrous Moonshine conjecture. Here we construct an analog~$G(\frak m)$ of a Lie group or Kac--Moody group, associated to~$\frak m$. The group~$G(\frak m)$ is given by generators and relations, analogous to a construction of a Kac--Moody group given by Tits. In the absence of local nilpotence of the adjoint representation of $\frak m$, we introduce the notion of pro-summability of an infinite sum of operators. We use this to construct a complete pro-unipotent group $\Uhp$ of automorphisms of a completion $\widehat{\mathfrak{m}}=\frak n^-\ \oplus\ \frak h\ \oplus\ \widehat{\frak n}^+$ of~$\mathfrak{m}$, where $\widehat{\frak n}^+$ is the formal product of the positive root spaces of $\frak m$. The elements of $\widehat{U}^+$ are pro-summable infinite series with constant term 1. The group $\widehat{U}^+$ has a subgroup~$\widehat{U}^+_\text{im}$, which is an analog of a complete unipotent group corresponding to the positive imaginary roots of~$\frak m$.We construct analogs $\text{Exp}: \widehat{\mathfrak{n}}^+\to\widehat{U}^+$ and $\text{Ad} :\widehat{U}^+ \to \Aut(\widehat{\frak{n}}^+)$ of the classical exponential map and adjoint representation. We show that the action of $\mathbb{M}$ on $\mathfrak m$ induces an action of~$\mathbb{M}$ on~$\widehat{\frak m}$, and that this in turn induces an action of $\mathbb{M}$ on~$\widehat{U}^+$. We also show that the action of $\mathbb{M}$ on $\widehat{\mathfrak n}^+$ is compatible with the action of $\widehat{U}^+$ on $\widehat{\mathfrak n}^+$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For $G$ amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Haar measure on the $p$-adic rotation groups via inverse limits of measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the Haar measure on the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal groups of rotations $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$ in dimension $d=2,3$, by exploiting the machinery of inverse limits of measure spaces, for every prime $p&gt;2$. We characterise $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$ as inverse limits of finite groups, of which we provide parametrisations and orders, together with an equivalent description through a multivariable Hensel lifting. Supplying these finite groups with their normalised counting measures, we get an inverse family of Haar measure spaces for each $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$. Finally, we constructively prove the existence of the so-called inverse limit measure of these inverse families, which is explicitly computable, and prove that it gives the Haar measure on $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$. Our results pave the way towards the study of the irreducible projective unitary representations of the $p$-adic rotation groups, with potential applications to the recently proposed $p$-adic quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to Letourmy and Vendramin, a representation of a skew brace is a pair of representations on the same vector space, one for the additive group and the other for the multiplicative group, that satisfies a certain compatibility condition. Following their definition, we shall explain how some of the results from representation theory of groups, such as Maschke's theorem and Clifford's theorem, extend naturally to that of skew braces. We shall also give some concrete examples to illustrate that skew brace representations are more difficult to classify than group representations.</description>

      <title>On Morita equivalences with endopermutation source and isotypies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of equivalence between blocks of finite group algebras called an almost isotypy. An almost isotypy restricts to a weak isotypy in Brou\'{e}'s original definition, and it is slightly weaker than Linckelmann's version. We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups - which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a Morita equivalence - gives rise to an almost isotypy if and only if the character values of a (hence any) source are rational integers. This generalises a previous result of Huang and Zhou. Consequently, if two blocks are Morita equivalent via a bimodule with endopermutation source, then they are almost isotypic.</description>
