      <title>Fast and Scalable FFT-Based GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Hessian Actions Arising in Linear Inverse Problems Governed by Autonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and scalable algorithm for performing matrix-vector multiplications ("matvecs") for block Toeplitz matrices. Such matrices, which are shift-invariant with respect to their blocks, arise in the context of solving inverse problems governed by autonomous systems, and time-invariant systems in particular. In this article, we consider inverse problems that are solved for inferring unknown parameters from observational data of a linear time-invariant dynamical system given in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). Matrix-free Newton-conjugate-gradient methods are often the gold standard for solving these inverse problems, but they require numerous actions of the Hessian on a vector. Matrix-free adjoint-based Hessian matvecs require solution of a pair of linearized forward/adjoint PDE solves per Hessian action, which may be prohibitive for large-scale inverse problems, especially when efficient low-rank approximations of the Hessian are not readily available, such as for hyperbolic PDE operators. Time invariance of the forward PDE problem leads to a block Toeplitz structure of the discretized parameter-to-observable (p2o) map defining the mapping from inputs (parameters) to outputs (observables) of the PDEs. This block Toeplitz structure enables us to exploit two key properties: (1) compact storage of the p2o map and its adjoint; and (2) efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based Hessian matvecs. The proposed algorithm is mapped onto large multi-GPU clusters and achieves more than 80 percent of peak bandwidth on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Excellent weak scaling is shown for up to 48 A100 GPUs. For the targeted problems, the implementation executes Hessian matvecs within fractions of a second, orders of magnitude faster than can be achieved by the conventional matrix-free Hessian matvecs via forward/adjoint PDE solves.</description>

      <title>A non-intrusive data-based reformulation of a hybrid projection-based model reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven reformulation of the iterative SVD-rational Krylov algorithm (ISRK), in its original formulation a Petrov-Galerkin (two-sided) projection-based iterative method for model reduction combining rational Krylov subspaces (on one side) with Gramian/SVD based subspaces (on the other side). We show that in each step of ISRK, we do not necessarily require access to the original system matrices, but only to input/output data in the form of the system's transfer function, evaluated at particular values (frequencies). Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the new data-driven formulation.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical enhancements of the Kogbetliantz method for the SVD of order two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhanced Kogbetliantz method for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of general matrices of order two is proposed. The method consists of three phases: an almost exact prescaling, that can be beneficial to the LAPACK's xLASV2 routine for the SVD of upper triangular 2x2 matrices as well, a highly relatively accurate triangularization in the absence of underflows, and an alternative procedure for computing the SVD of triangular matrices, that employs the correctly rounded hypot function. A heuristic for improving numerical orthogonality of the left singular vectors is also presented and tested on a wide spectrum of random input matrices. On upper triangular matrices under test, the proposed method, unlike xLASV2, finds both singular values with high relative accuracy as long as the input elements are within a safe range that is almost as wide as the entire normal range. On general matrices of order two, the method's safe range for which the smaller singular values remain accurate is of about half the width of the normal range.</description>

      <title>A Note on Generalized Locally Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) matrix sequences arise from large linear systems that approximate Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs), and Integro-Differential Equations (IDEs). GLT sequences of matrices have been developed to study the spectral/singular value behaviour of the numerical approximations to various PDEs, Fades and IDEs. These approximations can be achieved using any discretization method on appropriate grids through local techniques such as Finite Differences, Finite Elements, Finite Volumes, Isogeometric Analysis, and Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Spectral and singular value symbols are essential for analyzing the eigenvalue and singular value distributions of matrix sequences in the Weyl sense. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the operator-theoretic aspect of GLT sequences. The theory of GLT sequences, along with findings on the asymptotic spectral distribution of perturbed matrix sequences, is a highly effective and successful method for calculating the spectral symbol f. Therefore, developing an automatic procedure to compute the spectral symbols of these matrix sequences would be advantageous, a task that Ahmed Ratnani, N S Sarathkumar, S. Serra-Capizzano have partially undertaken. As an application of the theory developed here, we propose an automatic procedure for computing the symbol of the underlying sequences of matrices, assuming they form a GLT sequence that meets mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive Least-Squares Functional A Posteriori Error Estimator: Linear and Nonlinear Problems with Plain Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The a posteriori error estimator using the least-squares functional can be used for adaptive mesh refinement and error control even if the numerical approximations are not obtained from the corresponding least-squares method. This suggests the development of a versatile non-intrusive a posteriori error estimator. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for applying the least-squares functional error estimator to linear and nonlinear problems that are not solved by the least-squares finite element methods. For the case of an elliptic PDE solved by the standard conforming finite element method, we minimize the least-squares functional with conforming approximation inserted to recover the other physical meaningful variable. By combining the numerical approximation from the original method with the auxiliary recovery approximation, we construct the least-squares functional a posteriori error estimator. Furthermore, we introduce a new interpretation that views the non-intrusive least-squares functional error estimator as an estimator for the combined solve-recover process. This simplifies the reliability and efficiency analysis. We extend the idea to a model nonlinear problem. Plain convergence results are proved for adaptive algorithms of the general second order elliptic equation and a model nonlinear problem with the non-intrusive least-squares functional a posteriori error estimators.</description>

      <title>Regularisation for the approximation of functions by mollified discretisation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some prominent discretisation methods such as finite elements provide a way to approximate a function of $d$ variables from $n$ values it takes on the nodes $x_i$ of the corresponding mesh.  The accuracy is $n^{-s_a/d}$ in $L^2$-norm, where $s_a$ is the order of the underlying method. When the data are measured or computed with systematical experimental noise, some statistical regularisation might be desirable, with a smoothing method of order $s_r$ (like the number of vanishing moments of a kernel). This idea is behind the use of some regularised discretisation methods, whose approximation properties are the subject of this paper. We decipher the interplay of $s_a$ and $s_r$ for reconstructing a smooth function on regular bounded domains from $n$ measurements with noise of order $\sigma$. We establish that for certain regimes with small noise $\sigma$ depending on $n$, when $s_a &gt; s_r$, statistical smoothing is not necessarily the best option and {\it not regularising} is more beneficial than {\it statistical regularising}. We precisely quantify this phenomenon and show that the gain can achieve a multiplicative order $n^{(s_a-s_r)/(2s_r+d)}$. We illustrate our estimates by numerical experiments conducted in dimension $d=1$ with $\mathbb P_1$ and $\mathbb P_2$ finite elements.</description>

      <title>H(curl)-based approximation of the Stokes problem with slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations governing incompressible Stokes flow are reformulated such that the velocity is sought in the space H(curl). This relaxed regularity assumption leads to conforming finite element methods using spaces common to discretizations of Maxwell's equations. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it is not immediately clear how to enforce Navier-slip boundary conditions. By recognizing the slip condition as a Robin boundary condition, we show that the continuous system is well-posed, propose finite element methods, and analyze the discrete system by deriving stability and a priori error estimates. Numerical experiments in 2D confirm the derived, optimal convergence rates.</description>

      <title>On accelerated iterative schemes for anisotropic radiative transfer using residual minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the iterative solution of anisotropic radiative transfer problems using residual minimization over suitable subspaces. We show convergence of the resulting iteration using Hilbert space norms, which allows us to obtain algorithms that are robust with respect to finite dimensional realizations via Galerkin projections. We investigate in particular the behavior of the iterative scheme for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in the angular variable in combination with subspaces that are derived from related diffusion problems. The performance of the resulting schemes is investigated in numerical examples for highly anisotropic scattering problems with heterogeneous parameters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Inference for Distributed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a broad consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) will be a defining component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks. As a specific instance, AI-empowered sensing will gather and process environmental perception data at the network edge, giving rise to integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA). Many applications, such as autonomous driving and industrial manufacturing, are latency-sensitive and require end-to-end (E2E) performance guarantees under stringent deadlines. However, the 5G-style ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) techniques designed with communication reliability and agnostic to the data may fall short in achieving the optimal E2E performance of perceptive wireless systems. In this work, we introduce an ultra-low-latency (ultra-LoLa) inference framework for perceptive networks that facilitates the analysis of the E2E sensing accuracy in distributed sensing by jointly considering communication reliability and inference accuracy. By characterizing the tradeoff between packet length and the number of sensing observations, we derive an efficient optimization procedure that closely approximates the optimal tradeoff. We validate the accuracy of the proposed method through experimental results, and show that the proposed ultra-Lola inference framework outperforms conventional reliability-oriented protocols with respect to sensing performance under a latency constraint.</description>

      <title>Active flux methods for hyperbolic conservation laws -- flux vector splitting and bound-preservation: Two-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the active flux (AF) methods for two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws, focusing on the flux vector splitting (FVS) for the point value update and bound-preserving (BP) limitings, which is an extension of our previous work [J.M. Duan, W. Barsukow, C. Klingenberg, arXiv:2405.02447]. The FVS-based point value update is shown to address the mesh alignment issue that appeared in a quasi-2D Riemann problem along one axis direction on Cartesian meshes. Consequently, the AF methods based on the FVS outperform those using Jacobian splitting, which are prone to transonic and mesh alignment issues. A shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can reduce oscillations well. Some benchmark problems are tested to verify the accuracy, BP property, and shock-capturing ability of our BP AF method. Moreover, for the double Mach reflection and forward-facing step problems, the present AF method can capture comparable or better small-scale features compared to the third-order discontinuous Galerkin method with the TVB limiter on the same mesh resolution, while using fewer degrees of freedom, demonstrating the efficiency and potential of our BP AF method for high Mach number flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Conservation of the passband signal amplitude using a filter based on the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an algorithm for a filter based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which, due to its characteristics, allows for an efficient computational implementation, ease of use, and minimizes amplitude variation in the filtered signal. The algorithm was implemented using the programming languages Python, R, and MATLAB. Initial results led to the conclusion that there was less amplitude loss in the filtered signal compared to the FIR filter. Future work may address a more rigorous methodology and comparative assessment of computational cost.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical investigation of different approximation techniques for the temporal weights used in the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method applied to a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation which is assumed to be convection-dominated. It is a continuation of a previous work by the authors where spatial weights were compared for a steady-state case. A higher-order finite elements approach is compared to a more cost-efficient higher-order reconstruction approach. Numerical examples point out the results regarding accuracy, efficiency and stability reasons.</description>

      <title>A uniquely solvable and positivity-preserving finite difference scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamical boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and analyze a finite difference numerical scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamical boundary condition. The singular logarithmic potential is included in the Flory-Huggins energy expansion. Meanwhile, a dynamical evolution equation for the boundary profile corresponds to a lower-dimensional singular energy potential. In turn, a theoretical analysis for the coupled system becomes very challenging, since it contains nonlinear and singular energy potentials for both the interior region and on the boundary. In the numerical design, a convex splitting approach is applied to the chemical potential associated with the energy both at the interior region and on the boundary: implicit treatments for the singular and logarithmic terms, as well as the surface diffusion terms, combined with an explicit treatment for the concave expansive term. In addition, the discrete boundary condition for the phase variable is coupled with the evolutionary equation of the boundary profile. The resulting numerical system turns out to be highly nonlinear, singular and coupled. A careful finite difference approximation and convexity analysis reveals that such a numerical system could be represented as a minimization of a discrete numerical energy functional, which contains both the interior and boundary integrals. More importantly, all the singular terms correspond to a discrete convex functional. As a result, a unique solvability and positivity-preserving analysis could be theoretically justified, based on the subtle fact that the singular nature of the logarithmic terms around the singular limit values prevent the numerical solutions reaching these values. The total energy stability analysis could be established by a careful estimate over the finite difference inner product. Some numerical results are presented in this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a poromechanics model including frictionless contact mechanics. The resulting model consists of the Biot equations with contact boundary conditions leading to a variational inequality modelling mechanical deformations coupled to a linear parabolic flow equation. We propose a fully discrete iterative scheme for solving this model. This scheme decoupled the flow and mechanics equations and extends the fixed-stress splitting scheme for the Biot equations. We use finite elements in space and a backward Euler discretization in time. We show that the fixed stress split scheme is a contraction.</description>

      <title>Simple matrix models for the flag, Grassmann, and Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive three families of orthogonally-equivariant matrix submanifold models for the Grassmann, flag, and Stiefel manifolds respectively. These families are exhaustive -- every orthogonally-equivariant submanifold model of the lowest dimension for any of these manifolds is necessarily a member of the respective family, with a small number of exceptions. They have several computationally desirable features. The orthogonal equivariance allows one to obtain, for various differential geometric objects and operations, closed-form analytic expressions that are readily computable with standard numerical linear algebra. The minimal dimension aspect translates directly to a speed advantage in computations. And having an exhaustive list of all possible matrix models permits one to identify the model with the lowest matrix condition number, which translates to an accuracy advantage in computations. As an interesting aside, we will see that the family of models for the Stiefel manifold is naturally parameterized by the Cartan manifold, i.e., the positive definite cone equipped with its natural Riemannian metric.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study para-Hermitian rational matrices and the associated structured rational eigenvalue problem (REP). Para-Hermitian rational matrices are square rational matrices that are Hermitian for all $z$ on the unit circle that are not poles. REPs are often solved via linearization, that is, using matrix pencils associated to the corresponding rational matrix that preserve the spectral structure. Yet, non-constant polynomial matrices cannot be para-Hermitian. Therefore, given a para-Hermitian rational matrix $R(z)$, we instead construct a $*$-palindromic linearization for $(1+z)R(z)$, whose eigenvalues that are not on the unit circle preserve the symmetries of the zeros and poles of $R(z)$. This task is achieved via M\"{o}bius transformations. We also give a constructive method that is based on an additive decomposition into the stable and anti-stable parts of $R(z)$. Analogous results are presented for para-skew-Hermitian rational matrices, i.e., rational matrices that are skew-Hermitian upon evaluation on those points of the unit circle that are not poles.</description>

      <title>M\"obius-Transformed Trapezoidal Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerical integration by combining the trapezoidal rule with a M\"obius transformation that maps the unit circle onto the real line. We prove that the resulting transformed trapezoidal rule attains the optimal rate of convergence if the integrand function lives in a weighted Sobolev space with a weight that is only assumed to be a positive Schwartz function decaying monotonically to zero close to infinity. Our algorithm only requires the ability to evaluate the weight at the selected nodes, and it does not require sampling from a probability measure defined by the weight nor information on its derivatives. In particular, we show that the M\"obius transformation, as a change of variables between the real line and the unit circle, sends a function in the weighted Sobolev space to a periodic Sobolev space with the same smoothness. Since there are various results available for integrating and approximating periodic functions, we also describe several extensions of the M\"obius-transformed trapezoidal rule, including function approximation via trigonometric interpolation, integration with randomized algorithms, and multivariate integration.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal mesh generation for the virtual element method: A fully adaptive remeshing procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mesh flexibility offered by the virtual element method through the permission of arbitrary element geometries, and the seamless incorporation of `hanging' nodes, has made the method increasingly attractive in the context of adaptive remeshing. There exists a healthy literature concerning error estimation and adaptive refinement techniques for virtual elements while the topic of adaptive coarsening (i.e. de-refinement) is in its infancy. The creation of a quasi-optimal mesh is based on the principle of quasi-even error distribution over the elements which inherently relies on localized refinement and coarsening techniques. Thus, necessitating a fully adaptive remeshing procedure. In this work a novel fully adaptive remeshing procedure for the virtual element method is presented. Additionally, novel procedures are proposed for the identification of elements qualifying for refinement or coarsening based on user-defined targets. Specifically, a target percentage error, target number of elements, or target number of nodes can be selected. Numerical results demonstrate that the adaptive remeshing procedure can meet any prescribed target while creating a quasi-optimal mesh. The proposed fully adaptive procedure is of particular interest in engineering applications requiring an efficient simulation of a given accuracy, or desiring a simulation with the maximum possible accuracy for a given computational constraint.</description>

      <title>A Lagrange Multiplier-based method for Stokes-linearized poro-hyperelastic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for the coupling between free fluid and a linearized poro-hyperelastic body. In this model, the Brinkman equation is employed for fluid flow in the porous medium, incorporating inertial effects into the fluid dynamics. A generalized poromechanical framework is used, incorporating fluid inertial effects in accordance with thermodynamic principles. We carry out the analysis of the unique solvability of the governing equations, and the existence proof relies on an auxiliary multi-valued parabolic problem. We propose a Lagrange multiplier-based mixed finite element method for its numerical approximation and show the well-posedness of both semi-and fully-discrete problems. Then, a priori error estimates for both the semi- and fully-discrete schemes are derived. A series of numerical experiments is presented to confirm the theoretical convergence rates, and we also employ the proposed monolithic scheme to simulate 2D physical phenomena in geophysical fluids and biomechanics of the brain function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study iterative signal reconstruction in computed tomography (CT), wherein measurements are produced by a linear transformation of the unknown signal followed by an exponential nonlinear map. Approaches based on pre-processing the data with a log transform and then solving the resulting linear inverse problem are tempting since they are amenable to convex optimization methods; however, such methods perform poorly when the underlying image has high dynamic range, as in X-ray imaging of tissue with embedded metal. We show that a suitably initialized subgradient method applied to a natural nonsmooth, nonconvex loss function produces iterates that converge to the unknown signal of interest at a geometric rate under the statistical model proposed by Fridovich-Keil et al. (arXiv:2310.03956). Our recovery program enjoys improved conditioning compared to the formulation proposed by the latter work, enabling faster iterative reconstruction from substantially fewer samples.</description>

      <title>The use of the symmetric finite difference in the local binary pattern (symmetric LBP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper provides a mathematical view to the binary numbers presented in the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature extraction process. Symmetric finite difference is often applied in numerical analysis to enhance the accuracy of approximations. Then, the paper investigates utilization of the symmetric finite difference in the LBP formulation for face detection and facial expression recognition. It introduces a novel approach that extends the standard LBP, which typically employs eight directional derivatives, to incorporate only four directional derivatives. This approach is named symmetric LBP. The number of LBP features is reduced to 16 from 256 by the use of the symmetric LBP. The study underscores the significance of the number of directions considered in the new approach. Consequently, the results obtained emphasize the importance of the research topic.</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

      <title>Analytical Identification of Design and Multidimensional Spaces Using R-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design space (DS) is defined as the combination of materials and process conditions that guarantees the assurance of quality. This principle ensures that as long as a process operates within DS, it consistently produces a product that meets specifications. A novel DS identification method called the R-DS identifier has been developed. It makes no assumptions about the underlying model - the only requirement is that each model constraint (CQA) should be approximated by a multivariate polynomial model. The method utilizes the methodology of Rvachev's R-functions and allows for explicit analytical representation of the DS with only a limited number of model runs. R-functions provide a framework for representing complex geometric shapes and performing operations on them through implicit functions. The theory of R-functions enables the solution of geometric problem such as identification of DS through algebraic manipulation. It is more practical than traditional sampling or optimization-based methods. The method is illustrated using a batch reactor system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an induction heating problem in a multi-component system containing a moving non-magnetic conductor. The electromagnetic process is described by the eddy current model, and the heat transfer process is governed by the convection-diffusion equation. Both processes are coupled by a restrained Joule heat source. A temporal discretization scheme is introduced to solve the corresponding variational system numerically. With the aid of the Reynolds transport theorem, we prove the convergence of the proposed scheme as well as the well-posedness of the variational problem. Some numerical experiments are also performed to assess the performance of the numerical scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the modeling and simulation of ionic transport and charge conservation inlithium-ion batteries (LIBs) at the microscale. It is a multiphysics problem that involves a wide range oftime scales. The associated computational challenges motivate the investigation of numerical techniquesthat can decouple the time integration of the governing equations in the liquid electrolyte and the solidphase (active materials and current collectors). First, it is shown that semi-discretization in space of thenon-dimensionalized governing equations leads to a system of index-1 semi-explicit differential algebraicequations (DAEs). Then, a new generation of strategies for multi-domain integration is presented,enabling high-order adaptive coupling of both domains in time, with efficient and potentially differentdomain integrators. They reach a high level of flexibility for real applications, beyond the limitations ofmultirate methods. A simple 1D LIB half-cell code is implemented as a demonstrator of the new strategyfor the simulation of different modes of cell operation. The integration of the decoupled subsystems isperformed with high-order accurate implicit nonlinear solvers. The accuracy of the space discretizationis assessed by comparing the numerical results to the analytical solutions. Then, temporal convergencestudies demonstrate the accuracy of the new multi-domain coupling approach. Finally, the accuracy andcomputational efficiency of the adaptive coupling strategy are discussed in the light of the conditioningof the decoupled subproblems compared to the one of the fully-coupled problem. This new approachwill constitute a key ingredient for the high-fidelity 3D LIB simulations based on actual electrodemicrostructures.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Delaunay hypervolume meshing for space-time applications: point insertion, quality heuristics, and bistellar flips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive guide to generating unconstrained, simplicial, four-dimensional (4D), hypervolume meshes for space-time applications. While several universal procedures for constructing unconstrained, d-dimensional, anisotropic Delaunay meshes are already known, many of the explicit implementation details are missing from the relevant literature for cases in which d &gt;= 4. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to provide explicit descriptions of the key components in the 4D meshing algorithm: namely, the point-insertion process, geometric predicates, element quality heuristics, and bistellar flips. This paper represents a natural continuation of the work which was pioneered by Anderson et al. in "Surface and hypersurface meshing techniques for space-time finite element methods", Computer-Aided Design, 2023. In this previous paper, hypersurface meshes were generated using a novel, trajectory-tracking procedure. In the current paper, we are interested in generating coarse, 4D hypervolume meshes (boundary meshes) which are formed by sequentially inserting points from an existing hypersurface mesh. In the latter portion of this paper, we present numerical experiments which demonstrate the viability of this approach for a simple, convex domain. Although, our main focus is on the generation of hypervolume boundary meshes, the techniques described in this paper are broadly applicable to a much wider range of 4D meshing methods. We note that the more complex topics of constrained hypervolume meshing, and boundary recovery for non-convex domains will be covered in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Identifying heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues via physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues have profound implications across diverse medical and engineering domains. However, identifying full-field heterogeneous elastic properties of soft materials using traditional engineering approaches is fundamentally challenging due to difficulties in estimating local stress fields. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven models to learn full-field mechanical responses such as displacement and strain from experimental or synthetic data. However, research studies on inferring full-field elastic properties of materials, a more challenging problem, are scarce, particularly for large deformation, hyperelastic materials. Here, we propose a physics-informed machine learning approach to identify the elasticity map in nonlinear, large deformation hyperelastic materials. We evaluate the prediction accuracies and computational efficiency of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by inferring the heterogeneous elasticity maps across three materials with structural complexity that closely resemble real tissue patterns, such as brain tissue and tricuspid valve tissue. We further applied our improved architecture to three additional examples of breast cancer tissue and extended our analysis to three hyperelastic constitutive models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney Rivlin, and Gent. Our selected network architecture consistently produced highly accurate estimations of heterogeneous elasticity maps, even when there was up to 10% noise present in the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate the Lanczos tau method for the discretization of time-delay systems in terms of a pencil of operators, allowing for new insights into this approach. As a first main result, we show that, for the choice of a shifted Legendre basis, this method is equivalent to Pad\'e approximation in the frequency domain. We illustrate that Lanczos tau methods straightforwardly give rise to sparse, self nesting discretizations. Equivalence is also demonstrated with pseudospectral collocation, where the non-zero collocation points are chosen as the zeroes of orthogonal polynomials. The importance of such a choice manifests itself in the approximation of the $H^2$-norm, where, under mild conditions, super-geometric convergence is observed and, for a special case, super convergence is proved; both significantly faster than the algebraic convergence reported in previous work.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach for the efficient implementation of self-adjusting multi-rate Runge-Kutta methods and we extend the previously available stability analyses of these methods to the case of an arbitrary number of sub-steps for the active components. We propose a physically motivated model problem that can be used to assess the stability of different multi-rate versions of standard Runge-Kutta methods and the impact of different interpolation methods for the latent variables. Finally, we present the results of several numerical experiments, performed with implementations of the proposed methods in the framework of the \textit{OpenModelica} open-source modelling and simulation software, which demonstrate the efficiency gains deriving from the use of the proposed multi-rate approach for physical modelling problems with multiple time scales.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic preserving finite volume method for the compressible Euler equations: analysis via dissipative measure-valued solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new asymptotic preserving (AP) finite volume scheme for the multidimensional compressible barotropic Euler equations to simulate low Mach number flows. The proposed scheme uses a stabilized upwind numerical flux, with the stabilization term being proportional to the stiff pressure gradient, and we prove its conditional energy stability and consistency. Utilizing the concept of dissipative measure-valued (DMV) solutions, we rigorously illustrate the AP properties of the scheme for well-prepared initial data. In particular, we prove that the numerical solutions will converge weakly to a DMV solution of the compressible Euler equations as the mesh parameter vanishes, while the Mach number is fixed. The DMV solutions then converge to a classical solution of the incompressible Euler system as the Mach number goes to zero. Conversely, we show that if the mesh parameter is kept fixed, we obtain an energy stable and consistent finite-volume scheme approximating the incompressible Euler equations as the Mach number goes to zero. The numerical solutions generated by this scheme then converge weakly to a DMV solution of the incompressible Euler system as the mesh parameter vanishes. Invoking the weak-strong uniqueness principle, we conclude that the DMV solution and classical solution of the incompressible Euler system coincide, proving the AP property of the scheme. We also present an extensive numerical case study in order to illustrate the theoretical convergences, wherein we utilize the techniques of K-convergence.</description>

The proposed model provides an alternative to the popular port-Hamiltonian framework and exhibits similar properties such as energy dissipation as well as structure-preserving interconnection and Petrov-Galerkin projection.

Besides the verification of these properties, we present ten examples from different fields of application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonconforming virtual element method (VEM) for advection-diffusion-reaction problems with continuous interior penalty (CIP) stabilization. The design of the method is based on a standard variational formulation of the problem (no skew-symmetrization), and boundary conditions are imposed with a Nitsche technique. We use the enhanced version of VEM, with a ``DoFi-DoFi'' stabilization in the diffusion and reaction terms. We prove stability of the proposed method and derive $h$-version error estimates.</description>

      <title>Entropy Increasing Numerical Methods for Prediction of Reversible and Irreversible Heating in Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of entropy plays a pivotal role in capturing reversible and irreversible heating in supercapacitors during charging/discharging cycles. However, numerical methods that can faithfully capture entropy variation in supercapacitors are still in lack. This work proposes a novel second-order accurate finite-volume scheme for a Poisson--Nernst--Planck--Fourier model developed in our previous work for the description of non-isothermal electrokinetics in supercapacitors. The temporal second-order accuracy with original entropy increase is achieved by modified Crank-Nicolson discretization for the logarithm of both temperature and ionic concentrations. Numerical analysis rigorously proves that the proposed schemes are able to preserve ionic mass conservation and entropy increase for a closed, thermally insulated supercapacitor. Numerical positivity of temperature and ionic concentrations is guaranteed by using logarithmic transformations. Extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes have expected accuracy and robust performance in preserving the desired properties. Temperature oscillation in the charging/discharging processes is successfully predicted, unraveling a quadratic scaling law of temperature rising slope against voltage scanning rate. It is also demonstrated that the variation of ionic entropy contribution, which is the underlying mechanism responsible for reversible heating, is faithfully captured. Our work provides a promising tool in predicting non-isothermal electrokinetics of supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>A parallel batch greedy algorithm in reduced basis methods: Convergence rates and numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "classical" (weak) greedy algorithm is widely used within model order reduction in order to compute a reduced basis in the offline training phase: An a posteriori error estimator is maximized and the snapshot corresponding to the maximizer is added to the basis. Since these snapshots are determined by a sufficiently detailed discretization, the offline phase is often computationally extremely costly. We suggest to replace the serial determination of one snapshot after the other by a parallel approach. In order to do so, we introduce a batch size $b$ and add $b$ snapshots to the current basis in every greedy iteration. These snapshots are computed in parallel. We prove convergence rates for this new batch greedy algorithm and compare them to those of the classical (weak) greedy algorithm in the Hilbert and Banach space case. Then, we present numerical results where we apply a (parallel) implementation of the proposed algorithm to the linear elliptic thermal block problem. We analyze the convergence rate as well as the offline and online wall-clock times for different batch sizes. We show that the proposed variant can significantly speed-up the offline phase while the size of the reduced problem is only moderately increased. The benefit of the parallel batch greedy increases for more complicated problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Image Denoising by Low-Rank Singular Vector Approximations of Geodesics' Gramian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of sophisticated cameras, the urge to capture high-quality images has grown enormous. However, the noise contamination of the images results in substandard expectations among the people; thus, image denoising is an essential pre-processing step. While the algebraic image processing frameworks are sometimes inefficient for this denoising task as they may require processing of matrices of order equivalent to some power of the order of the original image, the neural network image processing frameworks are sometimes not robust as they require a lot of similar training samples. Thus, here we present a manifold-based noise filtering method that mainly exploits a few prominent singular vectors of the geodesics' Gramian matrix. Especially, the framework partitions an image, say that of size $n \times n$, into $n^2$ overlapping patches of known size such that one patch is centered at each pixel. Then, the prominent singular vectors, of the Gramian matrix of size $n^2 \times n^2$ of the geodesic distances computed over the patch space, are utilized to denoise the image. Here, the prominent singular vectors are revealed by efficient, but diverse, approximation techniques, rather than explicitly computing them using frameworks like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which encounters $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ operations. Finally, we compare both computational time and the noise filtration performance of the proposed denoising algorithm with and without singular vector approximation techniques.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description and macroscopic limit of swarming dynamics with continuous leader-follower transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a kinetic description of swarming particle dynamics in an interacting multi-agent system featuring emerging leaders and followers. Agents are classically characterized by their position and velocity plus a continuous parameter quantifying their degree of leadership. The microscopic processes ruling the change of velocity and degree of leadership are independent, non-conservative and non-local in the physical space, so as to account for long-range interactions. Out of the kinetic description, we obtain then a macroscopic model under a hydrodynamic limit reminiscent of that used to tackle the hydrodynamics of weakly dissipative granular gases, thus relying in particular on a regime of small non-conservative and short-range interactions. Numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains show that the limiting macroscopic model is consistent with the original particle dynamics and furthermore can reproduce classical emerging patterns typically observed in swarms.</description>
