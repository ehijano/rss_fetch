      <title>Investigating the Colour-Magnitude Relations for White Dwarf Stars in SDSS Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, colour-magnitude relations (CMRs) for DA-type white dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric system were investigated. For this purpose, the SDSS data for 20,247 white dwarf stars, as provided in the study by Anguiano et al. (2017), were matched with the Gaia third data release (Gaia DR3) catalogue to obtain trigonometric parallax ($\varpi$) data. The SDSS $ugriz$ magnitudes of the stars were corrected for interstellar extinction using dust maps provided for the Milky Way, and distances from the Sun to the stars were calculated. The SDSS magnitudes were thus corrected for the effects of interstellar extinction. For the calibration of the stars, 5,516 white dwarf stars were selected, with apparent magnitudes brighter than $g_0=21$ mag and relative parallax errors measured to better than $\sigma_\varpi/\varpi=0.1$. Subsequently, three separate CMRs were derived for the absolute magnitudes $M_{\rm g}$, $M_{\rm r}$, and $M_{\rm i}$, each calibrated to two-colour indices. The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of the obtained CMRs are highly reliable in the bf range of 0.86 to 0.95. Moreover, the standard deviations of the differences between the absolute magnitudes obtained from the relations and the original ones of the calibration stars range from 0.26 to 0.37 mag.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy via Temporal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more sensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to spectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare X-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed spectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across a time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before any forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and time-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the few disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more precise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and nonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude using the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We explain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal formalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light curves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different wavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics subfields and domains.</description>

      <title>"Oh FUors where art thou": A search for long-lasting YSO outbursts hiding in infrared surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lasting episodes of high accretion can strongly impact stellar and planetary formation. However, the universality of these events during the formation of young stellar objects (YSOs) is still under debate. Accurate statistics of strong outbursts (FUors), are necessary to understand the role of episodic accretion bursts. In this work, we search for a population of FUors that may have gone undetected in the past because they either a) went into outburst before the start of modern monitoring surveys and are now slowly fading back into quiescence or b) are slow-rising outbursts that would not commonly be classified as candidate FUors. We hypothesise that the light curves of these outbursts should be well fitted by linear models with negative (declining) or positive (rising) slopes. The analysis of the infrared light curves and photometry of $\sim$99000 YSO candidates from SPICY yields 717 candidate FUors. Infrared spectroscopy of 20 candidates, from both the literature and obtained by our group, confirms that 18 YSOs are going through long-term outbursts and identifies two evolved sources as contaminants. The number of candidate FUors combined with previously measured values of the frequency of FUor outbursts, yield average outburst decay times that are 2.5 times longer than the rise times. In addition, a population of outbursts with rise timescales between 2000 and 5000 days must exist to obtain our observed number of YSOs with positive slopes. Finally, we estimate a mean burst lifetime of between 45 and 100 years.</description>

      <title>The new compact triple system: discovery of bright third star around contact binary using LAMOST-MRS spectra and photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the third star orbiting around known contact eclipsing binary J04+25 using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and publicly available photometry. This is a rare case of a hierarchical triple, where the third star is significantly brighter than the inner contact subsystem. We successfully extracted radial velocities for all three components, using the binary spectral model in two steps. Third star radial velocities have high precision and allow direct fitting of the orbit. The low precision of radial velocity measurements in the contact system is compensated by large number statistics. We employed a template matching technique for light curves to find periodic variation due to the light time travel effect (LTTE) using several photometric datasets. Joint fit of third star radial velocities and LTTE allowed us to get a consistent orbital solution with $P_3=941.40\pm0.03$ day and $e_3=0.059\pm0.007$. We made estimations of the masses $M_{\rm 12,~3}\sin^3{i_3}=1.05\pm0.02,~0.90\pm0.02~M_\odot$ in a wide system and discussed possible determination of an astrometric orbit in the future data release of Gaia. Additionally, we propose an empirical method for measuring a period and minimal mass of contact systems, based on variation of the projected rotational velocity ($V\sin{i}$) from the spectra.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Heating Events Associated with Fine-scale Flux Emergence in Ephemeral Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal heating has puzzled solar physicists for decades. The question of why the Sun's upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than its lower atmosphere remains a key mystery. It is commonly believed that the source of coronal heating comes from the Sun's magnetic field, and more complex magnetic dynamics is more efficient in heating. In an earlier work we studied the secondary (or finer-scale) flux emergence identified in five ephemeral regions (ERs), selected during the last solar minimum (Yang et al. 2024). Here we further explore the atmospheric response to the secondary flux emergences (SFEs) that were identified in the first paper. We further reveal that approximately 80 percent of the 172 identified SFEs are associated with atmospheric heating events. The heating is most likely associated with magnetic reconnection involved in the SFE. Overall, a solar quiet region is heated by several hundred thousand degrees, during flux emergence of an ER.</description>

      <title>Transverse waves observed in a fibril with the MiHI prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Fine-scale structures of the solar chromosphere, particularly fibrils, are known to host various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that can transport energy to the corona. In particular, absorption features observed in the H{\alpha} channel have been widely detected that exhibit transverse oscillations. Aims. We aimed to detect a high-frequency transverse oscillation in fibrils. Methods. We conducted a case study on a high-frequency transverse oscillation in a chromospheric fibril. A chromospheric fibril was observed on 24 August 2018, in the H{\alpha} spectral line, with the prototype Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager (MiHI) at the Swedish 1- meter Solar Telescope. The MiHI instrument is an integral field spectrograph capable of achieving ultra-high resolution simultaneously in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Results. The detected oscillation characteristics include a period of 15 s and a displacement amplitude of 42 km. Using the bisector method, we derived Doppler velocities and determined that the polarisation of the oscillation was elliptical. Conclusions. The energy contained in the oscillation ranges from 390 to 2300 W/m2, which is not sufficient to balance radiative losses of the chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 55 most likely binary lenses and 52 binary sources. The tools were effective detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Nucleon Coupling with Supergiant Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar environments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the $^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes advances in solar magnetography and developments in instrumental techniques of polarimetry and spectroscopy made at Paris-Meudon observatory in the second half of the twentieth century. The adventure started from Lyot expertise and extended progressively to the measurement of vector magnetic fields using various and improving polarimetric techniques (such as beam exchange or grid) or new spectroscopic methods (such as the MSDP imaging slicer), at Meudon and Pic du Midi, ending by the achievement of the state-of-the-art optimized and polarization free telescope THEMIS in 1999.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in simulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal diffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this, we run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for a billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure crystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real crystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae: kinematics, energy equipartition and anisotropy of multiple populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and ground-based telescopes. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to $\sim$10$R_h$. Our findings indicate that while first population (1G) stars' motions are isotropic, second population (2G) stars' motions are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: $2G_A$ and $2G_B$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range ($\sim$2-4$R_h$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population. Finally, we found that 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions than 2G stars, providing additional evidence of kinematic differences between the two stellar generations.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>

Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations have revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration has not yet been identified. We aim to provide a framework that incorporates the electric-field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via a velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric-field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii (Rs) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while leaving the electric potential unchanged. The approach described in this work enables the diffusion to be adjusted to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration. Even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>

      <title>A prolific solar flare factory. Nearly continuous monitoring of an active region nest with Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of active region nests, which are locations on the Sun with recurring flux emergence, are poorly constrained by observations from Earth alone. ESA's Solar Orbiter now monitors the far side of the Sun for extended periods of time. This facilitates observations of the entire Sun. We combined observations from near-Earth satellites and Solar Orbiter to evaluate the contribution of a long-lived active region nest to the global flaring activity of the Sun. We identified a location in Carrington coordinates with episodic bursts of flux emergence throughout 2022. The combined observations allowed a nearly continuous monitoring of this region from April to October, that is, during its most active period. GOES and Solar Orbiter/STIX were used to compare its flaring activity to that of the entire Sun. The region morphology was extracted from SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter/EUI extreme-ultraviolet images and was combined with magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI and Solar Orbiter/PHI to assess its unsigned magnetic flux. The active region nest grew in complexity from January to May due to repeated flux emergence events. The peak unsigned magnetic flux was $5\times10^{22}$Mx. The region caused 40% of the observed solar flares in 2022, including five months in which it produced 50-70% of all flares over the entire Sun (in the nearly continuous monitoring window). Of the 17 complex flaring NOAA active regions in 2022, this region contained 10, but they occupied less than 20% of the area in the active latitudes. Active region nests can maintain a high rate of flaring activity for several solar rotations and are more likely to produce complex active regions that can trigger X-class solar flares. Improving the identification and monitoring of long-lived active region nests would benefit space weather forecasts in the short to medium term.</description>

      <title>The Immediate, Exemplary, and Fleeting echelle spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf: Monitoring acceleration of slow progenitor circumstellar material, driven by shock interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.</description>

      <title>Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV&gt;0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a "bump" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for r-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor.We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at $M_g\sim-14$ mag lasting for $\sim100$ days, followed by a bright bump at $M_g\sim-17$ mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases.After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a peculiar smooth decline.While the H$\alpha$ profile displays two velocity components ($\sim 500$ and $3000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not detected. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>
