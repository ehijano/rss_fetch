      <title>Dynamics of Josephson junctions beyond the tunneling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.</description>

      <title>Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition $L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the metal edges.</description>

      <title>Modeling Memristor-Based Neural Networks with Manhattan Update: Trade-offs in Learning Performance and Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity (NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$, while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring non-Abelian quantum geometry and topology in a multi-gap photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</description>

      <title>Description of the orbital Hall effect from orbital magnetic moments of Bloch states: the role of a new correction term in bilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal hot-carrier breakdown in metasurface structures based on coplanar arrays of graphene microribbons connected with wide-gap bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches, sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.</description>

      <title>Polariton XY-simulators revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of polariton-based XY simulators.</description>

      <title>Revealing the impact of ambient molecular contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of layered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence of surface contamination in STM measurements.</description>

      <title>High luminescence efficiency of multi-valley excitonic complexes in heavily doped WSe2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter, we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically thin light emitters.</description>

      <title>Many-body interferometry with semiconductor spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot thermal machines - a guide to engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</description>

      <title>Automatic tuning of a donor in a silicon quantum device using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor spin qubits in silicon offer one- and two-qubit gates with fidelities beyond 99%, coherence times exceeding 30 seconds, and compatibility with industrial manufacturing methods. This motivates the development of large-scale quantum processors using this platform, and the ability to automatically tune and operate such complex devices. In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.</description>

      <title>Multi-Directional Periodic Driving of a Two-Level System beyond Floquet Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving. Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix. However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions. The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and control applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spin susceptibility of $d$-wave Hatsugai-Kohmoto altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength, and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism reduces the static transverse response.</description>

      <title>Spin responses of a disordered helical superconducting edge under Zeeman field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</description>

      <title>T-square electric resistivity and its thermal counterpart in RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling. The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$ resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.</description>

      <title>Resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation in 2D nonlinear crystal integrated with meta-waveguide: analytical vs numerical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical theory of second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid structures combining a nonlinear 2D crystal with a dielectric metasurface waveguide. The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening, governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability, whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams. These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics on a Twisted Cylindrical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures, heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential. This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime. Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and twist.</description>

      <title>Ion-Implanted Erbium in X-cut Thin-film Lithium Niobate: Luminescence and Low-Temperature Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a method for deterministic Er3+ doping of x-cut TFLN using focused ion beam (FIB) implantation with sub-100 nm spatial precision, enabling seamless integration of active rare-earth ions into this technologically relevant platform for lithium niobate integrated nanophotonics. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split 4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to 5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+ emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Upper critical in-plane magnetic field in quasi-2D layered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the interplay of applied external magnetic field and superconductivity has been invigorated by recent works on Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral multilayer graphene. These studies, with and without proximitized spin-orbit coupling, have opened up a new frontier in the exploration of unconventional superconductors as they offer a unique platform to investigate superconductivity with high degree of in-plane magnetic field resilience and even magnetic field-induced superconductivity. Here, we present a framework for analyzing the upper critical in-plane magnetic field data in multilayer superconductors. Our framework relies on an analytically tractable superconducting pairing model that captures the normal state phenomenology of these systems and applies it to calculate the relationship between the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ and the corresponding critical temperature $T_{c}$. We study the $H_{c2}-T_{c}$ critical curve as a function of experimental parameters (Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and depairing mechanisms (Zeeman and orbital coupling) for both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing. By applying our framework to analyze four recent Bernal bilayer graphene-WSe$_2$ experiments [1-4], we identify an apparent discrepancy between fitted and measured spin-orbit parameters, which we propose can be explained by an enhancement of the Land\'e g factor in the Bernal bilayer graphene experiments.</description>

Abstract: The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $\mu$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $\mu$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $\mu$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $\mu$A ${\mu}M^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR.</description>

Abstract: We establish a comprehensive probability theory for coherent transport of random waves through arbitrary linear media. The transmissivity distribution for random coherent waves is a fundamental B-spline with knots at the transmission eigenvalues. We analyze the distribution's shape, bounds, moments, and asymptotic behaviors. In the large n limit, the distribution converges to a Gaussian whose mean and variance depend solely on those of the eigenvalues. This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue distribution and unimodal transmissivity distribution.</description>

Abstract: In this Perspective article, we explore some of the promising spin and topology material platforms (e.g. spins in semi- and superconductors, skyrmionic, topological and 2D materials) being developed for such quantum components as qubits, superconducting memories, sensing, and metrological standards and discuss their figures of merit. Spin- and topology-related quantum phenomena have several advantages, including high coherence time, topological protection and stability, low error rate, relative ease of engineering and control, simple initiation and read-out. However, the relevant technologies are at different stages of research and development, and here we discuss their state-of-the-art, potential applications, challenges and solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) devices, local strains frequently coexist and intertwine with the twist-angle-dependent moir\'e superlattice, significantly influencing the electronic properties of TBG, yet their combined effects remain incompletely understood. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we study a TBG device exhibiting both a continuous twist-angle gradient from 0.35{\deg} to 1.30{\deg} and spatially varying strain fields, spanning the first (1.1{\deg}), second (0.5{\deg}) and third (0.3{\deg}) magic angles. We visualize the evolution of flat and remote bands in energy and real space with atomic resolution. Near the first magic angle, we discover an anomalous spectral weight transfer between the two flat band peaks, signifying the role of strain and electronic correlations, as further evidenced by an unusual spatial dispersion of these peaks within a moir\'e unit cell. In contrast, remote band peak energy offers a strain-insensitive indicator of the local twist angle. Structural analysis further reveals non-negligible shear strain across the sample. All observations are quantitatively reproduced by a continuum model that incorporates heterostrain and a self-consistent Hartree potential, revealing the critical but unexplored role of shear strain in shaping the low-energy electronic landscape of TBG.</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement characterization of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose twisted bilayers of certain group IV and IVB trigonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX$_{2}$ (M$=$Zr, Hf, Sn and X$=$S, Se) as moir\'{e} materials. In monolayer form these TMDs have conduction band minima near the three inequivalent Brillouin zone $M$ points and negligible spin-orbit coupling, implying six flavors of low-energy conduction band states. The flavor sectors decouple at the single-particle level and in twisted bilayers are accurately described by emergent moir\'e-periodic Hamiltonians that we derive from small-unit-cell density functional theory calculations. Because the valley-projected Hamiltonians have large valley-dependent mass anisotropies and are time-reversal invariant, spontaneous valley polarization is signaled in transport by anisotropy instead of by the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular dichroism signals commonly observed in graphene and $K$-valley TMD-based moir\'{e} multilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

Abstract: Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.</description>

      <title>Inherited Berry curvature of phonons in Dirac materials with time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum anomalous Hall effect with spatially uncorrelated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and an Anderson localization phase can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to the quantum confinement induced by the short correlation length of the disorder. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests a picture distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.</description>

      <title>General theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two- and higher-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, systems can exhibit geometry-dependent bands, where the spectrum and eigenstates under open boundary conditions depend on the bulk geometry even in the thermodynamic limit. Although geometry-dependent bands are widely observed, the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we address this problem by establishing a higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory based on the concept of "strip generalized Brillouin zones" (SGBZs), which describe the asymptotic behavior of non-Hermitian bands when a lattice is extended sequentially along its linearly independent axes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that geometry-dependent bands arise from the incompatibility of SGBZs and, for the first time, derive a general criterion for the geometry dependence of non-Hermitian bands: non-zero area of the complex energy spectrum or the imaginary momentum spectrum. Our work opens an avenue for future studies on the interplay between geometric effects and non-Hermitian physics, such as non-Hermitian band topology.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlation effects in the response of graphene and MoS2 monolayers to the impact of highly-charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2 is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF). In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.</description>

      <title>A heat-resilient hole spin qubit in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Low-Damping Magnon Pairs Detected by Fano Resonance of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mode fluctuations with a low damping are essential for quantum information and logic operations in magnonic devices. We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality ferromagnet under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe an \textit{unexpected} Fano resonance in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. We interpret this Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. With the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation well reproduces the observed Fano resonance, indicating the magnon pairs hold a recorded long lifetime.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically study minimal models of N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a N\'{e}el ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. We analyze Turov's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these N\'{e}el ordered systems. As a result, we find that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for specific directions of the N\'{e}el order, dictated by the crystal lattice symmetries. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Turov's invariants. We show that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the N\'{e}el order and the spin-orbit coupling, both originating from the broken symmetries that permit the Turov's invariant in the system.</description>

      <title>Giant near-field nonlinear electrophotonic effects in an angstrom-scale plasmonic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage.</description>
