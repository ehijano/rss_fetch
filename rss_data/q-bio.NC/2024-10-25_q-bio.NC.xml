      <title>Learning Image Derived PDE-Phenotypes from fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) model various physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic fields and fluid mechanics. Methods like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and PDE-Net 2.0 have been developed to identify and model PDEs based on data using sparse optimization and deep neural networks, respectively. While PDE models are less commonly applied to fMRI data, they hold the potential for uncovering hidden connections and essential components in brain activity. Using the ADHD200 dataset, we applied Canonical Independent Component Analysis (CanICA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction of fMRI data. We then used Sparse Ridge Regression to identify PDEs from the reduced data, achieving high accuracy in classifying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study demonstrates a novel approach to extracting meaningful features from fMRI data for neurological disorder analysis to understand the role of oxygen transport (delivery $\&amp;$ consumption) in the brain during neural activity relevant for studying intracranial pathologies.</description>

      <title>KMS states of Information Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.</description>

      <title>Confidence is detection-like in high-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence estimates are often "detection-like" - driven by positive evidence in favour of a decision. This empirical observation has been interpreted as showing human metacognition is limited by biases or heuristics. Here we show that Bayesian confidence estimates also exhibit heightened sensitivity to decision-congruent evidence in higher-dimensional signal detection theoretic spaces, leading to detection-like confidence criteria. This effect is due to a nonlinearity induced by normalisation of confidence by a large number of unchosen alternatives. Our analysis suggests that detection-like confidence is rational when computing confidence in a higher-dimensional evidence space than that assumed by the experimenter.</description>

      <title>Simulation and assimilation of the digital human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present the Digital Brain (DB), a platform for simulating spiking neuronal networks at the large neuron scale of the human brain based on personalized magnetic-resonance-imaging data and biological constraints. The DB aims to reproduce both the resting state and certain aspects of the action of the human brain. An architecture with up to 86 billion neurons and 14,012 GPUs, including a two-level routing scheme between GPUs to accelerate spike transmission up to 47.8 trillion neuronal synapses, was implemented as part of the simulations. We show that the DB can reproduce blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals of the resting-state of the human brain with a high correlation coefficient, as well as interact with its perceptual input, as demonstrated in a visual task. These results indicate the feasibility of implementing a digital representation of the human brain, which can open the door to a broad range of potential applications.</description>
