      <title>Scheduling the Off-Diagonal Weingarten Loss of Neural SDFs for CAD Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten (ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However, FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal: strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear, quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for robust CAD reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Visualization Biases MLLM's Decision Making in Network Data Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Interactive Hybrid Ocean: Spectrum-Consistent Wave Particle-FFT Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform-based (FFT) spectral oceans are widely adopted for their efficiency and large-scale realism, but they assume global stationarity and spatial homogeneity, making it difficult to represent non-uniform seas and near-field interactions (e.g., ships and floaters). In contrast, wave particles capture local wakes and ripples, yet are costly to maintain at scale and hard to match global spectral statistics.We present a real-time interactive hybrid ocean: a global FFT background coupled with local wave-particle (WP) patch regions around interactive objects, jointly driven under a unified set of spectral parameters and dispersion. At patch boundaries, particles are injected according to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local frequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy density, without disturbing the far field.Our approach introduces two main innovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation. We couple a global FFT background with local WP patches under a unified spectrum, achieving large-scale spectral consistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples.(2) Frequency-bucketed implementation. We design a particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis scheme based on frequency buckets, which preserves spectral energy consistency and sustains real-time interactive performance.Together, these innovations enable a unified framework that delivers both large-scale spectral realism and fine-grained interactivity in real time.</description>

      <title>CASteer: Steering Diffusion Models for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image generation, yet controlling their outputs to reliably erase undesired concepts remains challenging. Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects. Pseudocode is provided in the supplementary.</description>

      <title>Token Perturbation Guidance for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network. TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions, making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1 show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Global Feature Aggregation for Real-Time Indirect Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not present in the training dataset.</description>

      <title>NeurOp-Diff:Continuous Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Neural Operator Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most publicly accessible remote sensing data suffer from low resolution, limiting their practical applications. To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at https://github.com/zerono000/NeurOp-Diff.</description>

      <title>OLATverse: A Large-scale Real-world Object Dataset with Precise Lighting Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data. The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.</description>
