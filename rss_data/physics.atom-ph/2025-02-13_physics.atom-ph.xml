      <title>Extending frequency metrology to increasingly complex molecules: SI-traceable sub-Doppler mid-IR spectroscopy of trioxane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bringing increasingly complex polyatomic molecules within reach of precision measurement experiments offers fascinating and far-reaching prospects ranging from Earth sciences and astrophysics, to metrology and quantum sciences. Here, we demonstrate sub-Doppler spectroscopic measurements in the mid-IR fingerprint region of, to our knowledge, the largest molecule to date. To this end, we use a high-resolution ~10.3 $\mu$m spectrometer based on a sub-Hz quantum cascade laser remotely calibrated against state-of-the-art primary frequency standards via a metrology-grade fibre link. We perform saturated absorption spectroscopy in the v5 CO stretching mode of 1,3,5-trioxane, (H2CO)3, at a resolution of ~100 kHz, allowing us to measure the absolute frequency of hundreds of rovibrational transitions at unprecedented uncertainties for such a complex species, as low as ~5 kHz. Our work demonstrates the extension of frequency metrology methodologies to ever larger molecular system, confirming the potential of the technologies we develop for bringing increasingly complex species within reach of ultra-precise measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>High-resolution rapid-scanning Fourier-transform spectroscopy of ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond interferometry combined with acousto-optical phase modulation is an effective approach to implement various types of coherent nonlinear and multidimensional spectroscopy schemes. The high sensitivity of this method has recently enabled the study of highly dilute gaseous and ultracold quantum systems for which the attainable spectral resolution is of particular interest. Here, we directly compare the performance and spectral resolution between two experimental implementations, that are step-wise and continuous rapid scanning of the underlying Fourier transform interferometers. We show the performance advantage of the rapid-scanning approach and demonstrate a spectral resolution of 250 MHz in the spectroscopy of laser-cooled Li atoms. This is a 10-fold resolution improvement compared to previous experiments.</description>

      <title>Reducing thermal noises by a quantum refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the thermal noises in microwave (MW) resonators can bring about significant progress in many research fields. Recently, a bench-top cooling method using "quantum refrigerators" has been adopted to reduce the thermal noises, reaching around liquid nitrogen temperature. In this study, we investigate the possible cooling limit of the MW resonator by using three-level or four-level systems as the quantum refrigerator. In this refrigerator system, proper light pump makes the multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which continuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic elimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. It turns out, though the multilevel systems can be efficiently cooled down, the laser driving also significantly perturbs their energy levels. For three-level refrigerators, such perturbation causes the atom-resonator interaction to become off-resonant, impeding the heat transfer from the MW resonator to the refrigerator, which greatly weakens the cooling effect. We also find that, by using four-level systems as the refrigerator, this issue can be well overcome. Based on practical parameters, our estimation shows the cooling limit could reach the liquid helium temperature.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 11 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static dipole polarizabilities of group 11 elements (Cu, Ag, and Au) are computed using the relativistic coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Three types of relativistic effects on dipole polarizabilities are investigated: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The final recommended values, including uncertainties, are $46.91 \pm 1.31$ a.u. for Cu, $50.97 \pm 1.93$ a.u. for Ag, and $36.68 \pm 0.78$ a.u. for Au. Our results show close agreement with the values recommended in the 2018 Table of static dipole polarizabilities for neutral elements [\textit{Mol. Phys.} \textbf{2019}, \textit{117}, 1200], with reduced uncertainties for Ag and Au. The analysis indicates that scalar-relativistic effects are the dominant relativistic contribution for these elements, while SOC effects are negligible. The influence of electron correlation across all relativistic regimes is also evaluated, demonstrating its significant role in the accurate calculation of dipole polarizabilities.</description>
