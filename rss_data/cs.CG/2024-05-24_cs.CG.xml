      <title>On connections between k-coloring and Euclidean k-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Euclidean $k$-means problems we are given as input a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the goal is to find a set of $k$ points $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, so as to minimize the sum of the squared Euclidean distances from each point in $P$ to its closest center in $C$. In this paper, we formally explore connections between the $k$-coloring problem on graphs and the Euclidean $k$-means problem. Our results are as follows:
  $\bullet$ For all $k\ge 3$, we provide a simple reduction from the $k$-coloring problem on regular graphs to the Euclidean $k$-means problem. Moreover, our technique extends to enable a reduction from a structured max-cut problem (which may be considered as a partial 2-coloring problem) to the Euclidean $2$-means problem. Thus, we have a simple and alternate proof of the NP-hardness of Euclidean 2-means problem.
  $\bullet$ In the other direction, we mimic the $O(1.7297^n)$ time algorithm of Williams [TCS'05] for the max-cut of problem on $n$ vertices to obtain an algorithm for the Euclidean 2-means problem with the same runtime, improving on the naive exhaustive search running in $2^n\cdot \text{poly}(n,d)$ time.
  $\bullet$ We prove similar results and connections as above for the Euclidean $k$-min-sum problem.</description>

      <title>Minimum Consistent Subset in Interval Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V,E), each vertex of V is colored by a color from the set of colors C={c1, c2,..., c_{\alpha}}$. We take a subset S of V, such that for every vertex v in V\S, at least one vertex of the same color is present in its set of nearest neighbors in S. We refer to such a S as a consistent subset. The Minimum Consistent Subset (MCS) problem is the computation of a consistent subset of the minimum size. It is established that MCS is NP-complete for general graphs, including planar graphs. We expand our study to interval graphs and circle graphs in an attempt to gain a complete understanding of the computational complexity of the \mcs problem across various graph classes.
  This work introduces an (4\alpha+ 2)- approximation algorithm for MCS in interval graphs where \alpha is the number of colors in the interval graphs. Later, we show that in circle graphs, MCS is APX-hard.</description>

      <title>Flatten Anything: Unsupervised Neural Surface Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization plays an essential role in numerous computer graphics and geometry processing applications. Traditional parameterization approaches are designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers, thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods, our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and UV boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential of our proposed neural surface parameterization paradigm. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.01977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a self contained proof of a result of Dudley [Dud64]} which shows that a bounded convex-body in $\Re^d$ can be $\varepsilon$-approximated, by the intersection of $O_d\bigl(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2} \bigr)$ halfspaces, where $O_d$ hides constants that depends on $d$.</description>

      <title>Heterochromatic Geometric Transversals of Convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14091v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite sequence of sets $\left\{B_{n}\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is said to be a heterochromatic sequence from an infinite sequence of families $\left\{ \mathcal{F}_{n} \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers $\left\{ i_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $B_{n} \in \mathcal{F}_{i_{n}}$. In this paper, we have proved that if for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{F}_n$ is a family of {\em nicely shaped} convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that each heterochromatic sequence $\left\{B_{n}\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ from $\left\{ \mathcal{F}_{n} \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains at least $k+2$ sets that can be pierced by a single $k$-flat ($k$-dimensional affine space) then all but finitely many families in $\left\{\mathcal{F}_{n}\right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ can be pierced by finitely many $k$-flats. This result can be considered as a {\em countably colorful} generalization of the $(\aleph_0, k+2)$-theorem proved by Keller and Perles (Symposium on Computational Geometry 2022). We have also established the tightness of our result by proving a number of no-go theorems.</description>

      <title>Tagged barcodes for the topological analysis of gradient-like vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intending to introduce a method for the topological analysis of fields, we present a pipeline that takes as an input a weighted and based chain complex, produces a factored chain complex, and encodes it as a barcode of tagged intervals (briefly, a tagged barcode). We show how to apply this pipeline to the weighted and based chain complex of a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on a compact Riemannian manifold in both the smooth and discrete settings. Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between factored chain complexes endowed with the interleaving distance and their tagged barcodes endowed with the bottleneck distance. Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous. Finally, we prove that the tagged barcode of any such vector field can be approximated by the tagged barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.</description>
