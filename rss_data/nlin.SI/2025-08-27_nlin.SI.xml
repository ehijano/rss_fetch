      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Flipping relation as a reduced star-star relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the lens hyperbolic gamma solution to the star-star relation and the flipping relation from three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^3_b/\mathbb{Z}_r$. We explore that a certain limit of the star-star relation yields the latter symmetry transformation, which exchanges the edge interactions of two outer spins with a centrally sited spin. Furthermore, we obtain more solutions to the flipping relation in terms of the hyperbolic gamma, basic hypergeometric, and the Euler gamma functions.</description>

      <title>Regular and Floquet bases for gauge and gravity theories: a non perturbative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main topic of the paper is represented by the change of basis, in Heun-type equations, from the one of decaying (at two singular points) solutions to that of Floquet solutions. Crucial in the connection relations is the phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular singularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the quantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at all orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be derived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences describe ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of Seiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity solutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very encouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge period, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the procedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the gravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible with analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like Regge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an useful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on non-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the consequences in gravity perturbations.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>
