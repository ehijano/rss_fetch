      <title>Automated Market Making: the case of Pegged Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to model the exchange rate dynamics between two intrinsically linked cryptoassets, such as stablecoins pegged to the same fiat currency or a liquid staking token and its associated native token. Our approach employs multi-level nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, for which we derive key properties and develop calibration and filtering techniques. Then, we design an automated market maker (AMM) model specifically tailored for the swapping of closely related cryptoassets. Distinct from existing models, our AMM leverages the unique exchange rate dynamics provided by the multi-level nested OU processes, enabling more precise risk management and enhanced liquidity provision. We validate the model through numerical simulations using real-world data for the USDC/USDT and wstETH/WETH pairs, demonstrating that it consistently yields efficient quotes. This approach offers significant potential to improve liquidity in markets for pegged assets.</description>

      <title>How Wash Traders Exploit Market Conditions in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wash trading, the practice of simultaneously placing buy and sell orders for the same asset to inflate trading volume, has been prevalent in cryptocurrency markets. This paper investigates whether wash traders in Bitcoin act deliberately to exploit market conditions and identifies the characteristics of such manipulative behavior. Using a unique dataset of 18 million transactions from Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, I find that wash trading intensifies when legitimate trading volume is low and diminishes when it is high, indicating strategic timing to maximize impact in less liquid markets. The activity also exhibits spillover effects across platforms and decreases when trading volumes in other asset classes like stocks or gold rise, suggesting sensitivity to broader market dynamics. Additionally, wash traders exploit periods of heightened media attention and online rumors to amplify their influence, causing rapid but short-lived spikes in legitimate trading volume. Using an exogenous demand shock associated with illicit online marketplaces, I find that wash trading responds to contemporaneous events affecting Bitcoin demand. These results advance the understanding of manipulative practices in digital currency markets and have significant implications for regulators aiming to detect and prevent wash trading.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Vector Auto Regression and Neural Network Model for Order Flow Imbalance Prediction in High Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high frequency trading, accurate prediction of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) is crucial for understanding market dynamics and maintaining liquidity. This paper introduces a hybrid predictive model that combines Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) to forecast OFI and assess trading intensity. The VAR component captures linear dependencies, while residuals are fed into the FNN to model non-linear patterns, enabling a comprehensive approach to OFI prediction. Additionally, the model calculates the intensity on the Buy or Sell side, providing insights into which side holds greater trading pressure. These insights facilitate the development of trading strategies by identifying periods of high buy or sell intensity. Using both synthetic and real trading data from Binance, we demonstrate that the hybrid model offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and enhances strategic decision-making based on OFI dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the hybrid models performance with standalone FNN and VAR models, showing that the hybrid approach achieves superior forecasting accuracy across both synthetic and real datasets, making it the most effective model for OFI prediction in high frequency trading.</description>

      <title>Robot See, Robot Do: Imitation Reward for Noisy Financial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequential nature of decision-making in financial asset trading aligns naturally with the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, making RL a common approach in this domain. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio in financial markets results in noisy estimates of environment components, including the reward function, which hinders effective policy learning by RL agents. Given the critical importance of reward function design in RL problems, this paper introduces a novel and more robust reward function by leveraging imitation learning, where a trend labeling algorithm acts as an expert. We integrate imitation (expert's) feedback with reinforcement (agent's) feedback in a model-free RL algorithm, effectively embedding the imitation learning problem within the RL paradigm to handle the stochasticity of reward signals. Empirical results demonstrate that this novel approach improves financial performance metrics compared to traditional benchmarks and RL agents trained solely using reinforcement feedback.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for automated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research, particularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has attracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall short due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for discretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new data in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical value for investors.
  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically designed for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate the comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around three specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics an analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise numerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk assessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research remains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information. Unlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright Reports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major brokerage firms and fundamental research vendors. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github. com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>
