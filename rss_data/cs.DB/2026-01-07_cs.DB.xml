      <title>Case Count Metric for Comparative Analysis of Entity Resolution Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a new process and software system, the Case Count Metric System (CCMS), for systematically comparing and analyzing the outcomes of two different ER clustering processes acting on the same dataset when the true linking (labeling) is not known. The CCMS produces a set of counts that describe how the clusters produced by the first process are transformed by the second process based on four possible transformation scenarios. The transformations are that a cluster formed in the first process either remains unchanged, merges into a larger cluster, is partitioned into smaller clusters, or otherwise overlaps with multiple clusters formed in the second process. The CCMS produces a count for each of these cases, accounting for every cluster formed in the first process. In addition, when run in analysis mode, the CCMS program can assist the user in evaluating these changes by displaying the details for all changes or only for certain types of changes. The paper includes a detailed description of the CCMS process and program and examples of how the CCMS has been applied in university and industry research.</description>

      <title>Accurate Table Question Answering with Accessible LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a table T in a database and a question Q in natural language, the table question answering (TQA) task aims to return an accurate answer to Q based on the content of T. Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.
  We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.
  We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SpANNS: Optimizing Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for Sparse Vectors Using Near Memory Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental operation in vector databases, enabling efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces. While dense ANNS has been optimized using specialized hardware accelerators, sparse ANNS remains limited by CPU-based implementations, hindering scalability. This limitation is increasingly critical as hybrid retrieval systems, combining sparse and dense embeddings, become standard in Information Retrieval (IR) pipelines. We propose SpANNS, a near-memory processing architecture for sparse ANNS. SpANNS combines a hybrid inverted index with efficient query management and runtime optimizations. The architecture is built on a CXL Type-2 near-memory platform, where a specialized controller manages query parsing and cluster filtering, while compute-enabled DIMMs perform index traversal and distance computations close to the data. It achieves 15.2x to 21.6x faster execution over the state-of-the-art CPU baselines, offering scalable and efficient solutions for sparse vector search.</description>

      <title>Recursive querying of neural networks via weighted structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive querying of machine learning models - viewed as a form of intentional data - enables their verification and interpretation using declarative languages, thereby making learned representations of data more accessible. Motivated by the querying of feedforward neural networks, we investigate logics for weighted structures. In the absence of a bound on neural network depth, such logics must incorporate recursion; thereto we revisit the functional fixpoint mechanism proposed by Gr\"adel and Gurevich. We adopt it in a Datalog-like syntax; we extend normal forms for fixpoint logics to weighted structures; and show an equivalent "loose" fixpoint mechanism that allows values of inductively defined weight functions to be overwritten. We propose a "scalar" restriction of functional fixpoint logic, of polynomial-time data complexity, and show it can express all PTIME model-agnostic queries over reduced networks with polynomially bounded weights. In contrast, we show that very simple model-agnostic queries are already NP-complete. Finally, we consider transformations of weighted structures by iterated transductions.</description>

      <title>HONEYBEE: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enterprise deployments of vector databases require access control policies to protect sensitive data. These systems often implement access control through hybrid vector queries that combine nearest-neighbor search with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: dedicated per-user indexes minimize query latency but incur high memory redundancy, while shared indexes with post-search filtering reduce memory overhead at the cost of increased latency. This paper introduces HONEYBEE, a dynamic partitioning framework that leverages the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to create a smooth trade-off between these extremes. RBAC policies organize users into roles and assign permissions at the role level, creating a natural ``thin waist" in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HONEYBEE produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling memory overhead. To guide these decisions, HONEYBEE develops analytical models of vector search performance and recall, and formulates partitioning as a constrained optimization problem that balances memory usage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HONEYBEE achieves up to 13.5X lower query latency than row-level security with only a 1.24X increase in memory usage, while achieving comparable query performance to dedicated, per-role indexes with 90.4% reduction in additional memory consumption, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.</description>

      <title>Thucy: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Claim Verification across Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's age, it is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher truth from lies. Every day, politicians, media outlets, and public figures make conflicting claims -- often about topics that can, in principle, be verified against structured data. For instance, statements about crime rates, economic growth or healthcare can all be verified against official public records and structured datasets. Building a system that can automatically do that would have sounded like science fiction just a few years ago. Yet, with the extraordinary progress in LLMs and agentic AI, this is now within reach. Still, there remains a striking gap between what is technically possible and what is being demonstrated by recent work. Most existing verification systems operate only on small, single-table databases -- typically a few hundred rows -- that conveniently fit within an LLM's context window.
  In this paper we report our progress on Thucy, the first cross-database, cross-table multi-agent claim verification system that also provides concrete evidence for each verification verdict. Thucy remains completely agnostic to the underlying data sources before deployment and must therefore autonomously discover, inspect, and reason over all available relational databases to verify claims. Importantly, Thucy also reports the exact SQL queries that support its verdict (whether the claim is accurate or not) offering full transparency to expert users familiar with SQL. When evaluated on the TabFact dataset -- the standard benchmark for fact verification over structured data -- Thucy surpasses the previous state of the art by 5.6 percentage points in accuracy (94.3% vs. 88.7%).</description>

      <title>Accelerating Storage-Based Training for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.
