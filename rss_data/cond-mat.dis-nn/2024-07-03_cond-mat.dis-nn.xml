      <title>Conditioning the complexity of random landscapes on marginal optima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-independent bounds on complex optimization through the statistics of marginal optima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization seeks extremal points in a function. When there are superextensively many optima, optimization algorithms are liable to get stuck. Under these conditions, generic algorithms tend to find marginal optima, which have many nearly flat directions. In a companion paper, we introduce a technique to count marginal optima in random landscapes. Here, we use the statistics of marginal optima calculated using this technique to produce generic bounds on optimization, based on the simple principle that algorithms will overwhelmingly tend to get stuck only where marginal optima are found. We demonstrate the idea on a simple non-Gaussian problem of maximizing the sum of squared random functions on a compact space. Numeric experiments using both gradient descent and generalized approximate message passing algorithms fall inside the expected bounds.</description>

      <title>Statistical signatures of abstraction in deep neural networks</title>

Abstract: We study how abstract representations emerge in a Deep Belief Network (DBN) trained on benchmark datasets. Our analysis targets the principles of learning in the early stages of information processing, starting from the "primordial soup" of the under-sampling regime. As the data is processed by deeper and deeper layers, features are detected and removed, transferring more and more "context-invariant" information to deeper layers. We show that the representation approaches an universal model -- the Hierarchical Feature Model (HFM) -- determined by the principle of maximal relevance. Relevance quantifies the uncertainty on the model of the data, thus suggesting that "meaning" -- i.e. syntactic information -- is that part of the data which is not yet captured by a model. Our analysis shows that shallow layers are well described by pairwise Ising models, which provide a representation of the data in terms of generic, low order features. We also show that plasticity increases with depth, in a similar way as it does in the brain. These findings suggest that DBNs are capable of extracting a hierarchy of features from the data which is consistent with the principle of maximal relevance.</description>

      <title>Cluster truncated Wigner approximation for bond-disordered Heisenberg spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the cluster Truncated Wigner Approximation (cTWA) applied to quench dynamics in bond-disordered Heisenberg spin chains with power-law interactions. We find that cTWA yields highly accurate results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy hinges on a suitable choice of clusters. By using a clustering strategy inspired by the strong disorder renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space renormalization group (RSRG), clusters of two spins are sufficient to obtain essentially exact results in the regime of strong disorder. Surprisingly, even for rather weak disorder, e.g.\ in the presence of very long-range interactions, this choice of clustering outperforms a naive choice of clusters of consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete sampling scheme for the initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally introduced scheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme puts cTWA on the same conceptional footing as regular dTWA for single spins and yields some reduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.</description>

      <title>Localization beyond Dirac and Weyl fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, providing a natural generalization to the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-s. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions, scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and the magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for even (odd) s. Remarkably, we find the localization correction to scale exponentially with s, i.e., faster moving electrons are strongly susceptible to disorder effects. This opens up intriguing possibility for Anderson localization and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <title>Universal mechanism of shear thinning in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft glassy materials experience a significant reduction in viscosity $\eta$ when subjected to shear flow, known as shear thinning. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law scaling of $\eta$ with the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$, $\eta \propto \dot{\gamma}^{-\nu}$, where the exponent $\nu$ is typically around $0.7$ to $0.8$ across different materials. Two decades ago, the mode coupling theory (MCT) suggested that shear thinning occurs due to the advection. However, it predicts too large $\nu = 1$ (&gt; $0.7$ to $0.8$) and overestimates the onset shear rate by orders of magnitude. Recently, it was claimed that a minute distortion of the particle configuration is responsible for shear thinning. Here we extend the MCT to include the distortion, and find that both advection and distortion contribute to shear thinning, but the latter is dominant. Our formulation works quantitatively for several different glass formers. We explain why shear thinning is universal for many glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ir growth pressure on the domain wall dynamics in Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta stacks</title>

Abstract: The dynamical response of magnetic domain walls to external magnetic fields in ultra-thin multilayer magnetic films is determined not only by the composition and thickness of the layers but also by the growth conditions. Growth conditions can induce significant structural changes inside the layers and at the interfaces between them, affecting in particular the dynamics of domain walls, their mobility, elastic tension, and the pinning forces acting on them. In this work, we focus specifically on the effect of Ir layer growth pressure in Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta ultra-thin multilayers films. Measurements of the DC magnetic properties, domain wall velocity and domain morphology in the creep regime for both constant and alternating field pulses, were performed for a batch of samples where the Ir layer was grown at different pressures. We find that the saturation magnetization, the effective anisotropy constant and the domain wall surface tension grow with increasing pressure and saturate at a threshold pressure, while the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field and the strength of the disorder remain practically unaltered over the range of pressures considered.</description>

      <title>How to compute efficiently the analytical solution to Heisenberg spin glass models on sparse random graphs and their de Almeida-Thouless line</title>

Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Self-learning Monte Carlo with equivariant Transformer</title>

Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning have revolutionized computational physics, particularly the simulation of complex systems. Equivariance is essential for simulating physical systems because it imposes a strong inductive bias on the probability distribution described by a machine learning model. However, imposing symmetry on the model can sometimes lead to poor acceptance rates in self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC). Here, we introduce a symmetry equivariant attention mechanism for SLMC, which can be systematically improved. We evaluate our architecture on a spin-fermion model (\textit{i.e.}, double exchange model) on a two-dimensional lattice. Our results show that the proposed method overcomes the poor acceptance rates of linear models and exhibits a similar scaling law to large language models, with model quality monotonically increasing with the number of layers. Our work paves the way for the development of more accurate and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms with machine learning for simulating complex physical systems.</description>

Abstract: The glassy dynamics of dense active matter have recently become a topic of interest due to their importance in biological processes such as wound healing and tissue development. However, while the liquid-state properties of dense active matter have been studied in relation to the glass transition of active matter, the solid-state properties of active glasses have yet to be understood. In this work, we study the structural fluctuations in the active glasses composed of self-propelled particles. We develop a formalism to describe the solid-state properties of active glasses in the harmonic approximation limit and use it to analyze the displacement fields in the active glasses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of high-frequency normal modes become quasi-static with respect to the active forces, and consequently, excitations of these modes are significantly suppressed. This leads to a violation of the equipartition law, suppression of particle displacements, and the apparent collective motion of active glasses. Overall, our results provide a fundamental understanding of the solid-state properties of active glasses.</description>
