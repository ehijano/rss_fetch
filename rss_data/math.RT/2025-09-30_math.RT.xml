      <title>Special modules over Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study special representations of finite-dimensional Jordan algebra $J$ whose $Rad^2 J=0$. For each Jordan algebra $J$ of this class we consider its Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction $TKK(J)$ and then associate to the latter a quiver with relations $Q$ such that the category of representations of $Q$ is isomorphic to the category of special representations of $J$.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Technique for the Wedderburn Decomposition of Rational Group Algebras of Nested GVZ $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>A construction of simple-minded systems over domestic Brauer graph algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a 2-domestic Brauer graph algebra. We present a construction for a family of objects on $A$-$\stmod$ to be a simple-minded system and our construction provides all simple-minded systems on $A$-$\stmod$. As a byproduct, we provide a new proof of AR-conjecture for 2-domestic Brauer graph algebras and we prove that a weakly simple-minded system with a finite cardinality is a simple-minded system on $A$-$\stmod$. We also prove that an orthogonal system $\mathcal{S}$ which contains at least one object for an Euclidean component extends to a simple-minded system on $A$-$\stmod$ and its extension closure $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is functorially finite.</description>

      <title>Strongly Hopfian and Co-Hopfian Acts over Monoids: Structure and Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and explore new classes of S-acts over a monoid S, namely, strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian acts, as well as their weaker counterparts, Hopfian and co-Hopfian acts. We investigate the relationships between these newly defined structures and well-studied classes of S-acts, including Noetherian, Artinian, injective, projective, quasi-injective, and quasi-projective acts. A key result shows that, under certain conditions, a quasi-projective (respectively quasi-injective) S-act that is strongly co-Hopfian (respectively strongly Hopfian) is also strongly Hopfian (respectively strongly co-Hopfian). Moreover, we provide a variety of examples and structural results concerning the behavior of subacts and quotient acts of strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian S-acts, further elucidating the internal structure and interrelationships within this extended framework.</description>

      <title>Decomposed Levi subgroups in BD-covers of classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For finite topological central extensions of $p$-adic classical groups, Heiermann and Wu introduced the notion of decomposed Levi subgroups in their study of intertwining algebras. In this note, we show that for symplectic and special orthogonal groups over local fields, except the split $\mathrm{SO}(4)$, all Levi subgroups are decomposed if the central extension arises from the Brylinski-Deligne construction. Discussions for certain unitary groups, $\mathrm{SO}(4)$ and $\mathrm{GSpin}(2n+1)$ are also given.</description>

      <title>Whittaker modules over the loop Virasoro algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study two classes of Whittaker modules over the loop Witt algebra ${\mathfrak g}:=\mathcal{W}\otimes\mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{W}=\text{Der}({\mathbb{C}}[t])$, $\mathcal{A}={\mathbb{C}}[t,t^{-1}]$. The necessary and sufficient conditions for these Whittaker modules being simple are determined. Furthermore, we study a family of Whittaker modules over the loop Virasoro algebra $\mathfrak{L}:=Vir\otimes\mathcal{A}$, where $Vir$ is the Virasoro algebra. The irreducibility criterion for these Whittaker modules are obtained. As an application, we give the irreducibility criterion for universal Whittaker modules of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_{2}}$.</description>

      <title>Mutating Species with Potentials and Cluster Tilting Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Smith proved that cluster-tilting objects in triangulated 2-Calabi--Yau categories are closely connected with mutation of quivers with potentials over an algebraically closed field. We prove a more general statement where instead of working with quivers with potentials we consider species with potential over a perfect field.
  We describe the $3$-preprojective algebra of the tensor product of two tensor algebras of acyclic species using a species with potential. In the case when the Jacobian algebra of a species with potential is self-injective, we provide a description of the Nakayama automorphism of a particular case of mutation of the species with potential where you mutate along orbits of the Nakayama permutation, which preserves self-injectivity.
  For certain types of Jacobian algebras of species with potentials, we prove that they lie in the scope of the derived Auslander-Iyama correspondence due to Jasso-Muro. Mutating along orbits of the Nakayama permutation stays within this setting, yielding a rich source of examples. All $2$-representation finite $l$-homogeneous algebras that are constructed using certain species with potential and mutations of such species with potentials are considered.</description>

      <title>Exact structures and maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories for modules over type $A$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties.
  On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\operatorname{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data.
  We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\operatorname{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\operatorname{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</description>

      <title>Weight modules and gluing of sheaves on the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of certain classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our cohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag manifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the affine quantum Schur algebras corresponding to the affine Hecke algebras of type C with three parameters. Multiplication formulas for semisimple generators are derived for these algebras. We prove that they admit a stabilization property in the sense of Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson, by which we construct quasi-split $\imath$quantum groups of affine type AIII with three parameters. Upon specialization of parameters, we recover some known multiplication formulas for affine quantum Schur algebras of types C and D with equal parameters. We take this opportunity to demonstrate in the appendix that different forms of multiplication formulas for affine quantum Schur algebras of types C with equal parameters across the literature are indeed equivalent.</description>

Abstract: For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Representation Theoretic Bases for the $\Delta$-Springer Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a descent monomial basis of $\Delta$-Springer modules $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, first defined by Griffin. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$ studied by Carlsson-Chou and Hanada, as well as the descent basis for the generalized coinvariant algebras $R_{n,k}$ studied by Haglund-Rhoades-Shimozono. This basis is deeply connected with a combinatorial object called battery-powered tableaux, introduced by Gillespie-Griffin. We highlight the representation theoretic properties of this monomial basis by using it to give a direct combinatorial proof of the graded Frobenius character of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ in terms of battery-powered tableaux, a fact which has only the geometric proof of Gillespie-Griffin.
  We also conjecture a higher Specht basis of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, generalizing the higher Specht basis of the coinvariant ring defined in Ariki-Terasoma-Yamada. This construction coincides with the Gillespie-Rhoades higher Specht basis for $R_{n,k}$. We give a proof for when $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is a partition of two rows.</description>

      <title>A functorial approach to $0$-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use functorial methods to define and study $0$-abelian categories, which we propose to be the case $n = 0$ of Jasso's $n$-abelian categories. In particular, we define a bifunctor for $0$-abelian categories with enough injectives or projectives, which is analogous to the extension bifunctor for an abelian category. We prove a few results concerning this bifunctor, including $0$-abelian versions of the long exact sequence involving the extension bifunctors, of a conjecture due to Auslander on the direct summands of the extension functors, and of the Hilton-Rees theorem. These results are then applied to the study of the stable categories of a $0$-abelian category, and a similar discussion is carried out for the stable categories of an abelian category. Moreover, by specializing our results to modules over rings, we show that $0$-abelian categories with additive generators are in correspondence with semi-hereditary rings. We present applications to these rings.</description>

      <title>Bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations and their intersection coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce rational bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations on a marked surface $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ as a proposed topological model for the rational tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{Sp_4,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}(\mathbb{Q}^{\mathsf{T}})$ of the Fock--Goncharov moduli space [FG06]. Our space consists of certain equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs introduced by Kuperberg [Kup96], together with rational measures. We define tropical coordinate systems using the $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-case of the intersection number of Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW25], and establish a bijection using the framework of the graded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-skein algebra. This provides a topological perspective for Fock--Goncharov duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the neutral block of the affine monodromic Hecke category for a reductive group is monoidally equivalent to the neutral block of the affine Hecke category for the endoscopic group. The semisimple complexes of both categories can be identified with the generalized Soergel bimodules via the Soergel functor. We extend this identification of semisimple complexes to the neutral blocks of the affine Hecke categories by the technical machinery developed by Bezrukavnikov and Yun.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the principal component of the exchange graph of hearts of a graded skew-gentle algebra can be identified with the corresponding exchange graph of S-graphs, using the geometric models and the intersection formula in \cite{QZZ}. Using the similar argument in \cite{BS, BMQS, CHQ}, we extend this identification to an isomorphism between the spaces of stability conditions and of quadratic differentials.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest relations (first proposed by Lusztig) between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove a factorizable version of the Feigin-Frenkel theorem on the center of the completed enveloping algebra of the affine Kac-Moody algebra attached to a simple Lie algebra at the critical level. On any smooth curve C we consider a sheaf of complete topological Lie algebras whose fiber at any point is the usual affine algebra at the critical level and consider its sheaf of completed enveloping algebras. We show that the center of this sheaf is a factorization algebra and establish that it is canonically isomorphic, in a factorizable manner, with the factorization algebra of functions on Opers on the pointed disk for the Langlands dual Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to study cluster-tilted algebras and their intermediate coverings, Zhu introduced the notion of repetitive cluster categories, defined as the orbit categories $\mathcal D^b(\mathcal H)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ for $1\leq p\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal H$ is a hereditary abelian category with tilting objects. In this paper, we compute partial but essential results on the Grothendieck groups of the repetitive cluster categories $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod}KA_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ and $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod} KD_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$. Our results extend the known computations for classical cluster categories, reveal new structural patterns arising from the repetitive parameter $p$, and provide further evidence of the close interplay between Grothendieck groups, Auslander-Reiten theory, and Coxeter transformations.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the canonical dimension of compactly induced representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical dimension is an invariant attached to admissible representations of p-adic reductive groups, which has only received significant attention in the case of mod-p representations. In the case of complex representations, the canonical dimension is closely related to the wavefront set. We find a new lower bound for the canonical dimension of a general compactly induced representation over an arbitrary coefficient field. This lower bound is uniform in the sense that it only depends on the group and not on the representation itself. In many cases, this provides a lower bound for the canonical dimension of supercuspidal representations and in the complex case we get a lower bound for the corresponding wavefront set. In order to obtain this result, we first generalize a result on the asymptotic growth of the cardinality of balls in the Bruhat-Tits building to the case of exceptional types.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ be a length category. We introduce the notation of Gabriel-Roiter measure with respect to $\Theta$ and extend Gabriel's main property to this setting. Using this measure, when $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ satisfies some technical conditions, we prove that $\mathcal{A}$ has an infinite number of pairwise nonisomorphic indecomposable objects if and only if it has indecomposable objects of arbitrarily large length. That is, the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture holds.</description>

Abstract: The goal of our work is to study the decomposition of the joint action of $\mathscr{G} = \text{SpO}(2n|1)$ and $\mathfrak{g}' = \mathfrak{osp}(2|2)$ on the supersymmetric algebra $\text{S} = \text{S}(\mathbb{C}^{2n|1} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{1|1})$. As proved by Merino and Salmasian, we have a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible representations of $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathfrak{g}'$ appearing as subrepresentations of $\text{S}$. In this paper, we obtained an explicit description of the highest weights and joint highest weight vectors for the representations of $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathfrak{g}'$ appearing in the duality.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras: Finiteness and tameness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\operatorname{g}$-finite (resp., $\operatorname{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er. This also proves Demonet's conjecture for finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. Furthermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, we establish the converse of Reading's theorem: if the $\operatorname{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Cohomology of Dominant Line Bundles for Real Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i&gt; 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Dimension identities, almost self-conjugate partitions, and BGG complexes for Hermitian symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An almost self-conjugate (ASC) partition has a Young diagram in which each arm along the diagonal is exactly one box longer than its corresponding leg. Classically, the ASC partitions and their conjugates appear in two of Littlewood's symmetric function identities. These identities can be viewed as Euler characteristics of BGG complexes of the trivial representation, for classical Hermitian symmetric pairs. In this paper, we consider partitions in which the arm-leg difference is an arbitrary constant $m$. By viewing these partitions as highest weights, we establish an infinite family of dimension identities between $\mathfrak{gl}_n$- and $\mathfrak{gl}_{n+m}$-modules. We then interpret this result in the context of blocks in parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$: in particular, we exhibit six infinite families of congruent blocks whose corresponding posets of highest weights consist of the partitions in question. These posets, in turn, lead to generalizations of the Littlewood identities and their corresponding BGG complexes. Our results in this paper shed light on the surprising combinatorics underlying the work of Enright and Willenbring (2004).</description>

Abstract: We extend the theory of fields/distributions developed the paper "A Feigin-Frenkel theorem with n singularities" to a general base scheme. In order to do so we introduce suitable notions of topological sheaves on schemes and study their basic properties. We then construct appropriate analogues of the spaces of fields, consider multiplication of fields between them and rebuild the basic theory of vertex algebras in the setting of global distributions in place of formal power series, which takes the form of chiral algebras introduced Beilinson and Drinfeld in "Chiral Algebras".</description>

      <title>Super Macdonald polynomials and BPS state counting on the blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Classifying Wavelet Coorbit Spaces in Dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coorbit spaces provide a rigorous framework for the assessment of the approximation theoretic properties of generalized wavelet systems. It is therefore useful to understand when two different wavelet systems give rise to the same scales of coorbit spaces. This paper provides an exhaustive answer to this question for the case of continuous wavelet transforms associated with matrix groups in dimension two.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove strong and explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras, which parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log |\mathfrak{g}|)^D)$ for $D \approx 3.11$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log |\mathfrak{g}|)$ when the Lie type is fixed and the generators are chosen uniformly at random.</description>
