      <title>High-throughput, high-brightness, ultrashort 90 keV electrons at 40 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency-compressed keV electron sources for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) face competing demands: short pulses require low charge, yet weak scatterers demand high flux; high repetition rates enable signal averaging, yet most systems operate $\lesssim$1 kHz with low detection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a 90 keV DC-RF source operating at 40 kHz with direct electron detection that address these challenges simultaneously. THz streaking retrieves compressed pulse durations of 97 $\pm$ 3 fs (FWHM) at 370 aC and 114 $\pm$ 47 fs (FWHM) at 2.8 fC. Long-term $t_0$ timing drifts, characterized independently both by convolution analysis of compression data and direct THz streaking measurements, lie between 65 - 95 fs (FWHM), among the lowest reported for RF-based systems. At low charge (17 aC), we report an intrinsic pulse duration of 56 fs (FWHM) from comparison of simulations to measured compression data, among the shortest for keV UED at $&gt;$16 aC. Moreover, 2.8 fC bunches, combined with 40 kHz repetition rate and direct detection, produce a detectable normalized throughput that is one (three-to-four) orders of magnitude higher than existing keV (MeV) sources. This enables practical UED studies of weakly scattering samples and processes previously impractical due to low cross-sections and long acquisition times.</description>

      <title>Development of CMOS LGAD sensors for the ALICE~3 Time of Flight detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation ALICE 3 experiment at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) requires detector technologies that combine fine spatial resolution, fast timing, and an extremely low material budget. This paper presents the design, characterization, and beam-test performance of MadPix, a monolithic CMOS sensor featuring an internal avalanche gain layer. The sensor is implemented in a 110 nm CMOS imaging process and demonstrates the portability of the Low Gain Avalanche Diode concept to a standard CMOS technology. The results showed an intrinsic gain between 10 and 13 and a time resolution of 75 ps.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Cryogenic Detector Test Station by Rejecting Electromagnetic Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the solution optimized for characterizing SNSPDs by rejecting electromagnetic interference from various sources. The proposed readout method enhances measurement stability and enables reliable device characterization at low bias currents, where the signal-to-noise ratio is typically limited. By effectively suppressing EMI-induced noise, the method improves the ability to distinguish genuine detection events from spurious signals and reduces the effort required for data analysis. The approach has been applied to preliminary measurements of SNSPDs exposed to $\alpha$ particles emitted from a $^{241}$Am source, demonstrating stable operation and clean signal acquisition. While a detailed study of $\alpha$ detection is underway, the method establishes a foundation for further characterization of SNSPDs with various incident particles. The demonstrated EMI rejection technique is expected to facilitate future research in particle detection and support ongoing SNSPD development for applications in nuclear and accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical platform for high-frequency gravitational wave and vector dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.</description>

      <title>SpaceWire-based Data Acquisition Network for the Solar Flare Sounding Rocket Experiment FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.</description>

Abstract: The Muon Collider, recently highlighted as Recommendation 1 in the U.S. National Academies report on Elementary Particle Physics, offers a unique opportunity for fixed-target experiments with high energy and luminosity. This paper outlines some of the challenges and possibilities for fixed-target experiments to study the multi-dimensional structure of hadrons at the Muon Collider. We present a sketch of an experiment making use of the high-energy muon beam from the Muon Collider that could serve as the next-generation hadronic physics experiment after the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Spaceflight KID Readout Electronics for PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.</description>
