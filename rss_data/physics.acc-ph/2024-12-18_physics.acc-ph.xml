      <title>Updates and Lessons Learned from NuMI Beamline at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beamline at Fermilab generates an intense muon neutrino beam for the NOvA (NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance) long-baseline neutrino experiment. Over the years, the NuMI beamline has been pivotal in advancing neutrino physics, providing invaluable data and insights. This proceeding paper discusses updates and the lessons learned from recent experiences during the beam operations, maintenance, and monitoring of the NuMI beamline. Key topics include the optimization of beam performance and challenges in maintaining beamline stability. The paper aims to share best practices and provide a road-map for future beamline projects, including the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF).</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Focusing on Power and Stability of VE Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory and modeling of new discovered effects of the oscillating e-beam boundary formed in a magnetic focusing channel on the stability, gain, and power of VE amplifiers are presented. The RF structure and e-beam circuit parameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the Determinant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited by the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the magnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine structure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating beam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Development of self-modulation as a function of plasma length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to determine whether the saturation length of the self-modulation (SM) instability of a long proton bunch in plasma could be determined by measuring the radius of the bunch halo SM produces. Results show that defocused protons acquire their maximum transverse momentum and exit the wakefields at a distance approximately equal to the saturation length of the wakefields. This suggests that measuring the radius of the halo as a function of plasma length in the AWAKE experiment would yield a very good estimate for the saturation length of SM.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Rutherford Cable AC Loss and Magnetization with the Coupled Axial and Transverse Currents Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupled axial and transverse currents (CATI) method was recently introduced to model the AC loss and magnetization in twisted composite superconducting strands with low computational cost and high accuracy. This method involves two-dimensional finite element (FE) models coupled with circuit equations representing the periodicity of the strand. In this paper, we propose to adapt the CATI method to Rutherford cables, which are periodic structures made of transposed superconducting strands. We focus on reproducing the interstrand coupling currents flowing across contact resistances between the strands and we analyze the associated AC loss. We show that results of a reference three-dimensional FE model are accurately reproduced with a strongly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical dynamics of neutron in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any multipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study of neutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole magnets. Our predictions agree with the results of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with considerations of neutron storage ring with straight section and discrete magnets focusing the beam.</description>
