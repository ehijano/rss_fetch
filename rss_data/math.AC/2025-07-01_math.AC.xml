      <title>Invariants of toric double determinantal rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of double determinantal ideals denoted $I_{mn}^r$, which are generated by minors of size 2, and show that they are equal to the Hibi rings of certain finite distributive lattices. We compute the number of minimal generators of $I_{mn}^r$, as well as the multiplicity, regularity, a-invariant, Hilbert function, and $h$-polynomial of the ring $R/I_{mn}^r$, and we give a new proof of the dimension of $R/I_{mn}^r$. We also characterize when the ring $R/I_{mn}^r$ is Gorenstein, thereby answering a question of Li in the toric case. Finally, we give combinatorial descriptions of the facets of the Stanley-Reisner complex of the initial ideal of $I_{mn}^r$ with respect to a diagonal term order.</description>

      <title>Separating polynomial invariants over non-closed fields of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that for any finite dimensional representation of a prime order group over the field of rational numbers, polynomial invariants of degree at most $3$ separate the orbits. A result providing an upper degree bound for separating invariants for representations of finite abelian groups over algebraically closed base fields of non-modular characteristic is generalized for the case of base fields that are not algebraically closed (like the fields of real or rational numbers).</description>

      <title>Derived functors and Hilbert polynomials over hypersurface rings-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a hypersurface local ring of dimension $d \geq 1$, $N$ a perfect $A$-module and let $I$ be an ideal in $A$ with $\ell(N/IN)$ finite. We show that there is a integer $r_I \geq -1$ (depending only on $I$ and $N$) such that if $M$ is any non-free maximal \CM \ (= MCM) $A$-module the functions $n \rightarrow \ell(\text{Tor}^A_1(M, N/I^{n+1}N))$, $n \rightarrow \ell(\text{Ext}^1_A(M, N/I^{n+1}N))$ and $n \rightarrow \ell(\text{Ext}^{d+1}(N/I^{n+1}N, M))$ (which are all of polynomial type) has degree $r_I$. Surprisingly a key ingredient is the classification of thick subcategories of the stable category of MCM $A$-modules (obtained by Takahashi, see \cite[6.6]{T}).</description>

      <title>The Gr\"obner basis for powers of a general linear form in a monomial complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study almost complete intersection ideals in a polynomial ring, generated by powers of all the variables together with a power of their sum. Our main result is an explicit description of the reduced Gr\"obner bases for these ideals under any term order. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, focusing on the structure of the initial ideal. We associate a lattice path to each monomial in the vector space basis of an Artinian monomial complete intersection and introduce a reflection operation on these paths, which enables a key counting argument. As a consequence, we provide a new proof that Artinian monomial complete intersections possess the strong Lefschetz property over fields of characteristic zero. Our results also offer new insights into the longstanding problem of classifying the weak Lefschetz property for such intersections in characteristic $p$. Furthermore, we show that the number of Gr\"obner basis elements in each degree is connected to several well-known sequences, including the (generalized) Catalan, Motzkin, and Riordan numbers, and connect these numbers to the study of entanglement detection in spin systems within quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Relationships of Subrings and their Applications to Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying the properties of a ring $R$, it is often useful to compare $R$ to other rings whose properties are already known. In this paper, we define three ways in which a subring $R$ might be compared to a larger ring $T$: being associated, being ideal-preserving, or being locally associated. We then explore how these properties of a subring might be leveraged to give information about $R$, including applications to the field of factorization. Of particular interest is the result that an order in a number field is associated if and only if it is both ideal-preserving and locally associated. We conclude with a discussion of how these properties are realized in the case of orders in a number field and how such orders might be found.</description>

      <title>The Rouquier dimension of the category of perfect complexes over a regular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Rouquier dimension of the category of perfect complexes over a regular ring is precisely the Krull dimension of the ring. Previously, it was known that the Krull dimension is an upper bound, the lower bound however was not known in general. In particular, for regular local rings this result is new. More generally, we show that a lower bound of the Rouquier dimension is given by the maximal length of a regular sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the discriminant of a polynomial, which we call the tolerant. The tolerant differs by a square from the duplicant, which was discovered in recent work on $\mathbb{P}^1$-loop spaces in motivic homotopy theory. We show that the tolerant is rational by deriving a formula in terms of discriminants. We also show that the tolerant satisfies many of the same properties as the discriminant. A notable difference between the two is that the discriminant is inversion invariant for all polynomials, whereas the tolerant is only inversion invariant on a proper multiplicative subset of polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an additive subcategory of left $\Lambda$-modules, we establish relations of the orthogonal classes of $\mathscr{C}$ and (co)res $\widetilde{\mathscr{C}}$ under separable equivalences. As applications, we obtain that the (one-sided) Gorenstein category and Wakamatsu tilting module are preserved under separable equivalences. Furthermore, we discuss when $G_{C}$-projective (injective) modules and Auslander (Bass) class with respect to $C$ are invariant under separable equivalences.</description>

      <title>Liftings of ideals in positive characteristic to those in characteristic zero: Higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove that the set of log discrepancies for a fixed exponent is discrete. Additionally, we show that the set of log canonical thresholds (lcts) of multi-ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic is contained within the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth variety over the complex number field. As a result, we find that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational if all the exponents are rational. We also obtain ACC for the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth varieties in positive characteristic. These findings generalize the author's results presented in arXiv in 2024 to the higher-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Wilf Inequality is preserved under Gluing of Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wilf Conjecture on numerical semigroups is an inequality connecting the Frobenius number, embedding dimension and the genus of the semigroup. The conjecture is still open in general. We prove that the Wilf inequality is preserved under gluing of numerical semigroups. If the numerical semigroups minimally generated by $A = \{ a_1, \ldots, a_p\}$ and $B = \{ b_1, \ldots, b_q\}$ satisfy the Wilf inequality, then so does their gluing which is minimally generated by $C =k_1A\sqcup k_2B$. We discuss the extended Wilf's Conjecture in higher dimensions and prove an analogous result.</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field. We also discuss extension of differential operators to localizations of rings and modules, and to colocalizations of modules.</description>

Abstract: We study the canonical trace of the fiber product of Noetherian rings. Furthermore, we extend results on the class of Cohen-Macaulay rings called Teter type to Noetherian rings. As an application of our study on canonical traces and Noetherian rings of Teter type, we compute the canonical trace of the Stanley-Reisner ring arising from a non-connected simplicial complex. In particular, we provide a characterization of Stanley-Reisner rings for which the canonical trace contains the graded maximal ideal, even when the underlying simplicial complex is not connected.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring of Krull dimension $d$ such that $(d!)R = R$, and let $A$ be a graded $R$-subalgebra of the polynomial algebra $R[t]$. We prove that every unimodular row of length $d + 1$ over $A$ can be completed to an invertible matrix. This is a generalization of a classical result by Rao, who proved that in the same setting, every unimodular row of length $d + 1$ over $R[t]$ admits a completion to an invertible matrix.</description>

Abstract: I consider the problem of existence of intrinsic determinantal equations for plane projective curves and hypersurfaces in projective space and prove that in many cases of interest there exist intrinsic determinantal equations. In particular I prove (1) in characteristic two any ordinary, plane projective curve of genus at least one is given by an intrinsic determinantal equation (2) in characteristic three any plane projective curve is an intrinsic Pfaffian (3) in any positive characteristic any plane projective curve is set theoretically the determinant of an intrinsic matrix (4) in any positive characteristic, any Frobenius split hypersurface in ${\bf P}^n$ is given by set theoretically as the determinant of an intrinsic matrix with homogeneous entries of degree between $1$ and $n-1$. In particular this implies that any smooth, Fano hypersurface is set theoretically given by an intrinsic determinantal equation and the same is also true for any Frobenius split Calabi-Yau hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Linear algebra over T-pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is part of an ongoing project to find a general algebraic framework for semiring theory. The structure theory of semirings is quite challenging, largely because of the lack of negation, and such basic properties such as unique factorization of polynomials, multiplicativity of determinants, and the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, all fail. (In fact in the max-plus algebra, the sum of two nonzero elements is never zero!) Consequently 0 is replaced by a distinguished T-submodule $ A_0$ of $ A,$ and $( A, A_0)$ is called a ``pair.'' This paper treats linear algebra over a (not necessarily distributive) semiring pair, with a range of applications to tropical algebra as well as related areas such as hyperrings and fuzzy rings.
  We turn to matrices and the question of whether the row rank, column rank, and submatrix rank of a matrix are equal. The submatrix rank is less than or equal to the row rank and the column rank in many cases, including ``metatangible pairs'' with unique negation, but there is a counterexample to equality, discovered some time ago by the second author, which we provide in a more general setting (``pairs of the second kind'') that includes the hyperfield of signs. We do find situations when equality holds, encompassing results by Akian, Gaubert, Guterman, Izhakian, Knebusch, and Rowen, including versions of Cramer's rule. We pay special attention to the question of Baker and Zhang whether $n+1$ vectors of length $n$ need be dependent.
  At the conclusion of the main part, we consider surpassing relations, which permit us to tighten our results. The categorical setting is given in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>
