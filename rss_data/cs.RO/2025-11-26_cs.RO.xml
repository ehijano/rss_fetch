      <title>Discover, Learn, and Reinforce: Scaling Vision-Language-Action Pretraining with Diverse RL-Generated Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling vision-language-action (VLA) model pre-training requires large volumes of diverse, high-quality manipulation trajectories. Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Mechanical Interaction Layer Enables Resilient Human-to-Robot Object Handovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object handover is a common form of interaction that is widely present in collaborative tasks. However, achieving it efficiently remains a challenge. We address the problem of ensuring resilient robotic actions that can adapt to complex changes in object pose during human-to-robot object handovers. We propose the use of Virtual Model Control to create an interaction layer that controls the robot and adapts to the dynamic changes in the handover process. Additionally, we propose the use of augmented reality to facilitate bidirectional communication between humans and robots during handovers. We assess the performance of our controller in a set of experiments that demonstrate its resilience to various sources of uncertainties, including complex changes to the object's pose during the handover. Finally, we performed a user study with 16 participants to understand human preferences for different robot control profiles and augmented reality visuals in object handovers. Our results showed a general preference for the proposed approach and revealed insights that can guide further development in adapting the interaction with the user.</description>

      <title>Robot-Powered Data Flywheels: Deploying Robots in the Wild for Continual Data Collection and Foundation Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have unlocked powerful zero-shot capabilities in vision and language, yet their reliance on internet pretraining data leaves them brittle in unstructured, real-world settings. The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

      <title>Online Learning-Enhanced High Order Adaptive Safety Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are an effective model-based tool to formally certify the safety of a system. With the growing complexity of modern control problems, CBFs have received increasing attention in both optimization-based and learning-based control communities as a safety filter, owing to their provable guarantees. However, success in transferring these guarantees to real-world systems is critically tied to model accuracy. For example, payloads or wind disturbances can significantly influence the dynamics of an aerial vehicle and invalidate the safety guarantee. In this work, we propose an efficient yet flexible online learning-enhanced high-order adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs. Our approach improves the safety of a CBF-certified system on the fly, even under complex time-varying model perturbations. In particular, we deploy our hybrid adaptive CBF controller on a 38g nano quadrotor, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle, against 18km/h wind.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Path Planning for Multiple Homogenous UAVs for Outdoor Formation-Flying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision-free path planning is the most crucial component in multi-UAV formation-flying (MFF). We use unlabeled homogenous quadcopters (UAVs) to demonstrate the use of a flow network to create complete (inter-UAV) collision-free paths. This procedure has three main parts: 1) Creating a flow network graph from physical GPS coordinates, 2) Finding a path of minimum cost (least distance) using any graph-based path-finding algorithm, and 3) Implementing the Ford-Fulkerson Method to find the paths with the maximum flow (no collision). Simulations of up to 64 UAVs were conducted for various formations, followed by a practical experiment with 3 quadcopters for testing physical plausibility and feasibility. The results of these tests show the efficacy of this method's ability to produce safe, collision-free paths.</description>

      <title>Development of a Testbed for Autonomous Vehicles: Integrating MPC Control with Monocular Camera Lane Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are becoming popular day by day not only for autonomous road traversal but also for industrial automation, farming and military. Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent gatekeeper: Safe Flight Planning and Formation Control for Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Multi-Agent gatekeeper, a framework that provides provable safety guarantees for leader-follower formation control in cluttered 3D environments. Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated 3D urban environment, where it achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate across 100 randomized trials, significantly outperforming baseline CBF and NMPC methods. Finally, we demonstrate the physical feasibility of the resulting trajectories on a team of quadcopters.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Inverse Dynamics MPC for Legged Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loco-manipulation demands coordinated whole-body motion to manipulate objects effectively while maintaining locomotion stability, presenting significant challenges for both planning and control. In this work, we propose a whole-body model predictive control (MPC) framework that directly optimizes joint torques through full-order inverse dynamics, enabling unified motion and force planning and execution within a single predictive layer. This approach allows emergent, physically consistent whole-body behaviors that account for the system's dynamics and physical constraints. We implement our MPC formulation using open software frameworks (Pinocchio and CasADi), along with the state-of-the-art interior-point solver Fatrop. In real-world experiments on a Unitree B2 quadruped equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator arm, our MPC formulation achieves real-time performance at 80 Hz. We demonstrate loco-manipulation tasks that demand fine control over the end-effector's position and force to perform real-world interactions like pulling heavy loads, pushing boxes, and wiping whiteboards.</description>

      <title>Unifying Perception and Action: A Hybrid-Modality Pipeline with Implicit Visual Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Action Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Cooperative Control Coupling Autonomous and Haptic Shared Control via Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haptic shared control (HSC) is effective in teleoperation when full autonomy is limited by uncertainty or sensing constraints. However, autonomous control performance achieved by maximizing HSC strength is limited because the dynamics of the joystick and human arm affect the robot's behavior. We propose a cooperative framework coupling a joystick-independent autonomous controller with HSC. A control barrier function ignores joystick inputs within a safe region determined by the human operator in real-time, while HSC is engaged otherwise. A pilot experiment on simulated tasks with tele-operated underwater robot in virtual environment demonstrated improved accuracy and reduced required time over conventional HSC.</description>

      <title>CoC-VLA: Delving into Adversarial Domain Transfer for Explainable Autonomous Driving via Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence. Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</description>

      <title>Collaborate sim and real: Robot Bin Packing Learning in Real-world and Physical Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D bin packing problem, with its diverse industrial applications, has garnered significant research attention in recent years. Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>ShapeForce: Low-Cost Soft Robotic Wrist for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact feedback is essential for contact-rich robotic manipulation, as it allows the robot to detect subtle interaction changes and adjust its actions accordingly. Six- axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.</description>

      <title>Active3D: Active High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction via Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an active exploration framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction that incrementally builds a multi-level uncertainty space and selects next-best-views through an uncertainty-driven motion planner. We introduce a hybrid implicit-explicit representation that fuses neural fields with Gaussian primitives to jointly capture global structural priors and locally observed details. Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement. The planning module formulates next-best-view selection as an Expected Hybrid Information Gain problem and incorporates a risk-sensitive path planner to ensure efficient and safe exploration. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and rendering quality, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world active reconstruction and robotic perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward generic control for soft robotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotics has advanced rapidly, yet its control methods remain fragmented: different morphologies and actuation schemes still require task-specific controllers, hindering theoretical integration and large-scale deployment. A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.</description>

      <title>HAFO: Humanoid Force-Adaptive Control for Intense External Force Interaction Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning controllers have made impressive progress in humanoid locomotion and light load manipulation. However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

      <title>Dynamic-ICP: Doppler-Aware Iterative Closest Point Registration for Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable odometry in highly dynamic environments remains challenging when it relies on ICP-based registration: ICP assumes near-static scenes and degrades in repetitive or low-texture geometry. We introduce Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware registration framework. The method (i) estimates ego motion from per-point Doppler velocity via robust regression and builds a velocity filter, (ii) clusters dynamic objects and reconstructs object-wise translational velocities from ego-compensated radial measurements, (iii) predicts dynamic points with a constant-velocity model, and (iv) aligns scans using a compact objective that combines point-to-plane geometry residual with a translation-invariant, rotation-only Doppler residual. The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is also simple to integrate into existing pipelines, runs in real time, and provides a lightweight solution for robust registration in dynamic environments. To encourage further research, the code is available at: https://github.com/JMUWRobotics/Dynamic-ICP.</description>

      <title>How Robot Kinematics Influence Human Performance in Virtual Robot-to-Human Handover Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotics have increased the possibilities for integrating robotic systems into human-involved workplaces, highlighting the need to examine and optimize human-robot coordination in collaborative settings. This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side.</description>

      <title>ArtiBench and ArtiBrain: Benchmarking Generalizable Vision-Language Articulated Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Quality-guided UAV Surface Exploration for 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasons for mapping an unknown environment with autonomous robots are wide-ranging, but in practice, they are often overlooked when developing planning strategies. Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency.</description>

      <title>Improved adaptive wind driven optimization algorithm for real-time path planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, path planning has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing global search capability and convergence accuracy through heuristic and learning-inspired optimization frameworks. However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\%, 11.63\% and 14.93\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Autonomous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents pNav, a novel power-management system that significantly enhances the power/energy-efficiency of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by jointly optimizing their physical/mechanical and cyber subsystems. By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a &gt;96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety.</description>

      <title>Metric, inertially aligned monocular state estimation via kinetodynamic priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation for flexible robotic systems poses significant challenges, particular for platforms with dynamically deforming structures that invalidate rigid-body assumptions. This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry.</description>

      <title>Gated Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants for Neural Signal-Controlled Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical assistive systems that directly decode user intent from neural signals require rigorous guarantees of reliability and trust. We present GUARDIAN (Gated Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants), a framework for real-time neuro-symbolic verification for neural signal-controlled robotics. GUARDIAN enforces both logical safety and physiological trust by coupling confidence-calibrated brain signal decoding with symbolic goal grounding and dual-layer runtime monitoring. On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41). We demonstrate 1.7x correct interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning safe and stable robot motions from demonstrations remains a challenge, especially in complex, nonlinear tasks involving dynamic, obstacle-rich environments. In this paper, we propose Safe and Stable Neural Network Dynamical Systems S$^2$-NNDS, a learning-from-demonstration framework that simultaneously learns expressive neural dynamical systems alongside neural Lyapunov stability and barrier safety certificates. Unlike traditional approaches with restrictive polynomial parameterizations, S$^2$-NNDS leverages neural networks to capture complex robot motions providing probabilistic guarantees through split conformal prediction in learned certificates. Experimental results on various 2D and 3D datasets -- including LASA handwriting and demonstrations recorded kinesthetically from the Franka Emika Panda robot -- validate S$^2$-NNDS effectiveness in learning robust, safe, and stable motions from potentially unsafe demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Action Policies by Prophesying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies excel in aligning language, perception, and robot control. However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.</description>

      <title>Strong Duality and Dual Ascent Approach to Continuous-Time Chance-Constrained Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses a continuous-time continuous-space chance-constrained stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem where the probability of failure to satisfy given state constraints is explicitly bounded. We leverage the notion of exit time from continuous-time stochastic calculus to formulate a chance-constrained SOC problem. Without any conservative approximation, the chance constraint is transformed into an expectation of an indicator function which can be incorporated into the cost function by considering a dual formulation. We then express the dual function in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. Under a certain assumption on the system dynamics and cost function, it is shown that a strong duality holds between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual. The Path integral approach is utilized to numerically solve the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop samples of system trajectories. We present simulation studies on chance-constrained motion planning for spatial navigation of mobile robots and the solution of the path integral approach is compared with that of the finite difference method.</description>

      <title>AVS: A Computational and Hierarchical Storage System for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are evolving into mobile computing platforms, equipped with powerful processors and diverse sensors that generate massive heterogeneous data, for example 14 TB per day. Supporting emerging third-party applications calls for a general-purpose, queryable onboard storage system. Yet today's data loggers and storage stacks in vehicles fail to deliver efficient data storage and retrieval. This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing. The design is grounded with system-level benchmarks on AV data that cover SSD and HDD filesystems and embedded indexing, and is validated on embedded hardware with real L4 autonomous driving traces. The prototype delivers predictable real-time ingest, fast selective retrieval, and substantial footprint reduction under modest resource budgets. The work also outlines observations and next steps toward more scalable and longer deployments to motivate storage as a first-class component in AV stacks.</description>

      <title>A K-means Inspired Solution Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Traveling Salesman Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.</description>

      <title>Learning Massively Multitask World Models for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Feasible First-Order Optimization via Safe Sequential QCQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Safe Sequential Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (SS-QCQP) algorithm, a first-order method for smooth inequality-constrained nonconvex optimization that guarantees feasibility at every iteration. The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees. Numerical experiments on a multi-agent nonlinear optimal control problem demonstrate that SS-QCQP and SS-QCQP-AS maintain feasibility, exhibit the predicted convergence behavior, and deliver solution quality comparable to second-order solvers such as SQP and IPOPT.</description>

      <title>IndEgo: A Dataset of Industrial Scenarios and Collaborative Work for Egocentric Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce IndEgo, a multimodal egocentric and exocentric dataset addressing common industrial tasks, including assembly/disassembly, logistics and organisation, inspection and repair, woodworking, and others. The dataset contains 3,460 egocentric recordings (approximately 197 hours), along with 1,092 exocentric recordings (approximately 97 hours). A key focus of the dataset is collaborative work, where two workers jointly perform cognitively and physically intensive tasks. The egocentric recordings include rich multimodal data and added context via eye gaze, narration, sound, motion, and others. We provide detailed annotations (actions, summaries, mistake annotations, narrations), metadata, processed outputs (eye gaze, hand pose, semi-dense point cloud), and benchmarks on procedural and non-procedural task understanding, Mistake Detection, and reasoning-based Question Answering. Baseline evaluations for Mistake Detection, Question Answering and collaborative task understanding show that the dataset presents a challenge for the state-of-the-art multimodal models. Our dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/FraunhoferIPK/IndEgo</description>

      <title>Maritime Small Object Detection from UAVs using Deep Learning with Altitude-Aware Dynamic Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are crucial in Search and Rescue (SAR) missions due to their ability to monitor vast maritime areas. However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios. We propose an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that scales and adaptively subdivides the image into tiles for enhanced small object detection. By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling. This approach enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based SAR operations under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Prune-Then-Plan: Step-Level Calibration for Stable Frontier Exploration in Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.</description>

      <title>GigaWorld-0: World Models as Data Engine to Empower Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Preserving Vision-Language Representations via Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling for Better Vision-Language-Action Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.</description>

      <title>Improved Linear-Time Construction of Minimal Dominating Set via Mobile Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile agents have emerged as a powerful framework for solving fundamental graph problems in distributed settings in recent times. These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.</description>

      <title>Map-World: Masked Action planning and Path-Integral World Model for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous driving must handle multiple plausible futures while remaining computationally efficient. Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.</description>

      <title>CostNav: A Navigation Benchmark for Cost-Aware Evaluation of Embodied Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Material-informed Gaussian Splatting for 3D World Reconstruction in a Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.</description>

      <title>VibraVerse: A Large-Scale Geometry-Acoustics Alignment Dataset for Physically-Consistent Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -&gt; physical attributes -&gt; modal parameters -&gt; acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>BRIC: Bridging Kinematic Plans and Physical Control at Test Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Wanderland: Geometrically Grounded Simulation for Open-World Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducible closed-loop evaluation remains a major bottleneck in Embodied AI such as visual navigation. A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI. Project website is at https://ai4ce.github.io/wanderland/.</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Demonstration-guided Learning Framework for Granular Material Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the complex physical properties of granular materials, research on robot learning for manipulating such materials predominantly either disregards the consideration of their physical characteristics or uses surrogate models to approximate their physical properties. Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics-based simulator for granular materials using the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by demonstrations generated through gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials within our simulator, eliminating the costly data collection and model training of prior methods. Experimental results show that our method, with its flexible design, trains robust policies that are capable of executing the task of transporting granular materials in both simulated and real-world environments, beyond the capabilities of standard reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and prior task-specific granular manipulation methods.</description>

      <title>Vision Language Models Can Parse Floor Plan Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can simultaneously reason about images and texts to tackle many tasks, from visual question answering to image captioning. This paper focuses on map parsing, a novel task that is unexplored within the VLM context and particularly useful to mobile robots. Map parsing requires understanding not only the labels but also the geometric configurations of a map, i.e., what areas are like and how they are connected. To evaluate the performance of VLMs on map parsing, we prompt VLMs with floor plan maps to generate task plans for complex indoor navigation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable capability of VLMs in map parsing, with a success rate of 0.96 in tasks requiring a sequence of nine navigation actions, e.g., approaching and going through doors. Other than intuitive observations, e.g., VLMs do better in smaller maps and simpler navigation tasks, there was a very interesting observation that its performance drops in large open areas. We provide practical suggestions to address such challenges as validated by our experimental results. Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-floorplan/</description>

      <title>SafePR: Unified Approach for Safe Parallel Robots by Contact Detection and Reaction with Redundancy Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid self-collisions and type-II singularities. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.</description>

      <title>Hestia: Voxel-Face-Aware Hierarchical Next-Best-View Acquisition for Efficient 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled efficient and photorealistic rendering. However, images for reconstruction are still either largely manual or constrained by simple preplanned trajectories. To address this issue, recent works propose generalizable next-best-view planners that do not require online learning. Nevertheless, robustness and performance remain limited across various shapes. Hence, this study introduces Voxel-Face-Aware Hierarchical Next-Best-View Acquisition for Efficient 3D Reconstruction (Hestia), which addresses the shortcomings of the reinforcement learning-based generalizable approaches for five-degree-of-freedom viewpoint prediction. Hestia systematically improves the planners through four components: a more diverse dataset to promote robustness, a hierarchical structure to manage the high-dimensional continuous action search space, a close-greedy strategy to mitigate spurious correlations, and a face-aware design to avoid overlooking geometry. Experimental results show that Hestia achieves non-marginal improvements, with at least a 4% gain in coverage ratio, while reducing Chamfer Distance by 50% and maintaining real-time inference. In addition, Hestia outperforms prior methods by at least 12% in coverage ratio with a 5-image budget and remains robust to object placement variations. Finally, we demonstrate that Hestia, as a next-best-view planner, is feasible for the real-world application. Our project page is https://johnnylu305.github.io/hestia web.</description>

      <title>FSR-VLN: Fast and Slow Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1 humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper formulates an irreversible hydrodynamic deployment problem for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarms and presents Nauplius Optimisation for Autonomous Hydrodynamics (NOAH), a novel nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift, irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony- based communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis. Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</description>

Abstract: As drone-based applications proliferate, paramount contactless sensing of airborne drones from the ground becomes indispensable. This work demonstrates concentrating on propeller rotational speed will substantially improve drone sensing performance and proposes an event-camera-based solution, \sysname. \sysname features two components: \textit{Count Every Rotation} achieves accurate, real-time propeller speed estimation by mitigating ultra-high sensitivity of event cameras to environmental noise. \textit{Every Rotation Counts} leverages these speeds to infer both internal and external drone dynamics. Extensive evaluations in real-world drone delivery scenarios show that \sysname achieves a sensing latency of 3$ms$ and a rotational speed estimation error of merely 0.23\%. Additionally, \sysname infers drone flight commands with 96.5\% precision and improves drone tracking accuracy by over 22\% when combined with other sensing modalities. \textit{ Demo: {\color{blue}https://eventpro25.github.io/EventPro/.} }</description>

      <title>SVBRD-LLM: Self-Verifying Behavioral Rule Discovery for Autonomous Vehicle Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As more autonomous vehicles operate on public roads, understanding real-world behavior of autonomous vehicles is critical to analyzing traffic safety, making policies, and public acceptance. This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.</description>

      <title>Continually Evolving Skill Knowledge in Vision Language Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>AutoFocus-IL: VLM-based Saliency Maps for Data-Efficient Visual Imitation Learning without Extra Human Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data. Code, datasets, and trained policy videos are available at https://AutoFocus-IL.github.io/.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Closed-Form Solution to Full Visual-Inertial State Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a closed-form initialization method that recovers the full visual-inertial state without nonlinear optimization. Unlike previous approaches that rely on iterative solvers, our formulation yields analytical, easy-to-implement, and numerically stable solutions for reliable start-up. Our method builds on small-rotation and constant-velocity approximations, which keep the formulation compact while preserving the essential coupling between motion and inertial measurements. We further propose an observability-driven, two-stage initialization scheme that balances accuracy with initialization latency. Extensive experiments on the EuRoC dataset validate our assumptions: our method achieves 10-20% lower initialization error than optimization-based approaches, while using 4x shorter initialization windows and reducing computational cost by 5x.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Generalization in Deep RL with a Robust Adaptation Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep reinforcement learning in real-world settings requires the ability to generalize across a variety of conditions, including both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate through extensive simulation and hardware locomotion experiments on a quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>RLZero: Direct Policy Inference from Language Without In-Domain Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reward hypothesis states that all goals and purposes can be understood as the maximization of a received scalar reward signal. However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.</description>

      <title>LiHi-GS: LiDAR-Supervised Gaussian Splatting for Highway Driving Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction plays an important role in autonomous driving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to simulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional acquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time, photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.

      <title>ARBoids: Adaptive Residual Reinforcement Learning With Boids Model for Cooperative Multi-USV Target Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.</description>

      <title>OceanGym: A Benchmark Environment for Underwater Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</description>

      <title>From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs. Code and model weights will be released at https://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Control of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for multi-agent control synthesis, which applies to a wide range of problems with convergence guarantees, regardless of the complexity of the underlying graph topology and the explicit time dependence of the objective function. The proposed framework systematically addresses a particularly challenging problem in multi-agent systems, i.e., decentralization of entangled dynamics among different agents, and it naturally supports multi-objective robotics and real-time implementations. To demonstrate its generality and effectiveness, the framework is implemented across three experiments, namely time-varying leader-follower formation control, decentralized coverage control for time-varying density functions without any approximations, which is a long-standing open problem, and safe formation navigation in dense environments.</description>
