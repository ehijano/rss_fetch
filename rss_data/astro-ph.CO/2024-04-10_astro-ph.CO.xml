      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Black Hole Power Spectra from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that it allows to systematically identify all scenarios consistent with current and future pulsar-timing-array data.</description>

      <title>Late-end reionization with ATON-HE: towards constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new suite of late-end reionization simulations performed with ATON-HE, a revised version of the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON that includes helium. The simulations are able to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ flux distribution of the E-XQR-30 sample of QSO absorption spectra at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$, and show that a large variety of reionization models are consistent with these data. We explore a range of variations in source models and in the early-stage evolution of reionization. Our fiducial reionization history has a midpoint of reionization at $z = 6.5$, but we also explore an `Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 7.5$ and an `Extremely Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 9.5$. Haloes massive enough to host observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters are highly biased. The fraction of such haloes embedded in ionized bubbles that are large enough to allow high Ly$\alpha$ transmission becomes close to unity much before the volume filling factor of ionized regions. For our fiducial reionization history this happens at $z = 8$, probably too late to be consistent with the detection by JWST of abundant Ly$\alpha$ emission out to $z = 11$. A reionization history in our `Early' model or perhaps even our `Extremely Early' model may be required, suggesting a Thomson scattering optical depth in tension with that reported by Planck, but consistent with recent suggestions of a significantly higher value.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dark Matter Around Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a massive scalar field dark matter scenarios in the large mass limit around a central Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature. This implies that the scalar cloud located at the center of galaxies may have survived untill present times.</description>

      <title>Gravitational production of massive scalars in the context of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up a formalism for calculating the energy density generated in a quantized massive scalar field in the course of the drastic change in spacetime geometry at the end of the inflationary era. The calculation relies on the notion of adiabatic vacuum. The Bogolubov coefficients are computed by employing the sudden approximation. After obtaining a general formula, we calculate explicitly the energy density generated in a particle species with $m/H \ll1$, where $m$ is the particle mass and $H$ is the Hubble constant during the inflationary epoch. We find the contribution of the long-wavelength modes to be $\propto H^5/m$. If such particles are very weakly interacting, they can come to dominate the total energy density in the Universe. Other cosmological implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory Imprints on the CMB from Populations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: To showcase and characterise the rich phenomenology of temperature fluctuation patterns that are imprinted on the CMB by the gravitational wave memory (GWM) of massive black hole (BH) mergers. Methods: We analyse both individual binaries as well as populations of binaries, distributed in local cosmological boxes at a given redshift. Results: The magnitude of the temperature fluctuations scales primarily as a function of binary total mass and pattern angular scale, and accumulates as a random-walk process when populations of mergers are considered. Fluctuations of order $\sim 10^{-10}$ K are easily reached across scales of $\sim 1'$ to $\sim 1^{\circ}$ for realistic volumetric merger rates of 10$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, as appropriate for massive galaxies at $z=1$. We determine numerically that GWM temperature fluctuations result in a universal power spectrum with a scaling of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.7}$. Conclusion: While not detectable given the limitations of current all-sky CMB surveys, our work explicitly shows how every black hole merger in the Universe left us its unique faint signature.</description>

      <title>Model independent cosmographic constraints from DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore model independent constraints on the universe kinematics up to the snap and jerk hierarchical terms. To do so, we consider the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) release provided by the DESI collaboration, tackling the $r_d$ parameter to span within the range $[144,152]$ Mpc, with fixed step, $\delta r_d=2$ Mpc, aligning with Planck and DESI results. Thus, employing Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, we place stringent constraints on the cosmographic series, incorporating three combinations of data catalogs: the first BAO with observational Hubble data, the second BAO with type Ia supernovae, and the last including all three data sets. Our results conclusively constrain the cosmographic series, say the deceleration $q_0$, the jerk $j_0$, and the snap $s_0$ parameters, at the $2$--$\sigma$ level, showcasing a significant departure on $j_0$ even at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level, albeit being compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm on $q_0$ and $s_0$, at $2$--$\sigma$ level. Analogously, the $h_0$ tension appears alleviated in the second hierarchy, say including snap. Finally, a direct comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM models and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is reported, definitively favoring the wCDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Neutrino at different epochs of the Friedmann Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, at least two relics of the Big Bang have survived - the cosmological microwave background (CMB) and the cosmological neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Being the second most abundant particle in the Universe, the neutrino has a significant impact on its evolution from the Big Bang to the present day. Neutrinos affect the following cosmological processes: the expansion rate of the Universe, its chemical and isotopic composition, the CMB anisotropy and the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Another relic neutrino background is theoretically predicted, it consists of non-equilibrium antineutrinos of Primordial Nucleosynthesis arising as a result of the decays of neutrons and tritium nuclei. Such antineutrinos are an indicator of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In addition to experimentally detectable active neutrinos, the existence of sterile neutrinos is theoretically predicted to generate neutrino masses and explain their oscillations. Sterile neutrinos can also solve such cosmological problems as the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe and the nature of dark matter. The recent results of several independent experiments point to the possibility of the existence of a light sterile neutrino. However, the existence of such a neutrino is inconsistent with the predictions of the Standard Cosmological Model. The inclusion of a non-zero lepton asymmetry of the Universe and/or increasing the energy density of active neutrinos can eliminate these contradictions and reconcile the possible existence of sterile neutrinos with Primordial Nucleosynthesis, the CMB anisotropy, and also reduce the H$_0$-tension. In this brief review, we discuss the influence of the physical properties of active and sterile neutrinos on the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day.</description>

      <title>Studying the Supernova Absolute Magnitude Constancy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding we review and expand on our recent work investigating the constancy of the absolute magnitude $M_B$ of Type Ia supernovae. In it, we used baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to calibrate the supernova data and to check whether the resulting $M_B$ is constant. We used non-parametric methods like Gaussian processes and artificial neural networks to reconstruct $M_B(z)$. Here we elaborate on the results by putting them in the context of other studies investigating possible non-constant $M_B$ and the impact of the distance-duality relation. We also present some numerical details on the calculations in the original paper and new non-parametric reconstructions, including a conservative model-independent fit, confirming its main results. Notably, we see that $M_B$ remains constant within $1\sigma$, with a possible jump around $z = 0.01 - 0.15$. Furthermore, the observed distribution of $M_B(z)$ cannot be described by a single Gaussian, displaying multiple peaks and tails. The choice of the only remaining parameter -- the sound horizon $r_d$ leads to a tension in the $M_B-r_d$ plane. Fitting different non-constant $M_B(z)$ models does not significantly improve the fit and there is no preference for any of the models by the statistical measures we employ.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Cosmological Gravitational Particle Production in Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the framework of cosmological gra\-vi\-ta\-tional particle production, employing the Bogoliubov approach. We examine two well-known baryogenesis scenarios, namely baryogenesis in Grand Unified Theories (GUT) and leptogenesis, while considering reheating temperatures sufficiently low for thermal processes to be negligible. Considering $\alpha-$attractor T-models for the inflaton potential, we demonstrate that GUT baryogenesis from scalar decays can be successful across a large range of conformal couplings with gravity, without necessitating substantial levels of CP violation. In the case of leptogenesis, we find that the reheating temperature should be $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^{6}~{\rm GeV}$ for right-handed neutrino masses $M_1 \lesssim 6 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$ to generate the observed asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of dark matter with the extreme galaxy AGC 114905</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGC 114905 is a dwarf gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy seemingly in tension with the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas morphology, remains somewhat uncertain. We present unmatched ultra-deep optical imaging of AGC 114905 reaching surface brightness limits $\mu_{\rm r,lim} \approx 32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ ($3\sigma$; 10 arcsec $\times$ 10 arcsec) obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. With the new imaging, we characterise the galaxy's morphology, surface brightness, colours, and stellar mass profiles in great detail. The stellar disc has a similar extent as the gas, presents spiral arms-like features, and shows a well-defined edge. Stars and gas share similar morphology, and crucially, we find an inclination of $31\pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the previous determinations. We revisit the rotation curve decomposition of the galaxy, and we explore different mass models in the context of CDM, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), fuzzy dark matter (FDM) or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that the latter does not fit the circular speed of the galaxy, while CDM only does so with dark halo parameters rarely seen in cosmological simulations. Within the uncertainties, SIDM and FDM remain feasible candidates to explain the observed kinematics of AGC 114905.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the physical origin of the prominent Lyman-$\alpha$ emission and absorption in GS9422 at $z = 5.943$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-photometric analysis of the galaxy GS9422 from the JADES GTO survey located at $z=5.943$, anomalously showing a simultaneous strong Ly$\alpha$ emission feature and damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA), based on JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam observations. The best-fit modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a young, low-mass (${\rm log}(M_\star/M_{\odot}) = 7.8 \pm 0.01$) galaxy, with a mass-weighted mean age of the stellar population of $(10.9^{+0.07}_{-0.12})\,$Myr. The identified strong nebular emission lines suggest a highly ionized ($O_{32} = 59$), low-metallicity ($12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 7.78\pm 0.10$) star-forming galaxy with a star-formation rate SFR = ($8.2 \pm 2.8$) $\rm M_{\odot}\;yr^{-1}$ over a compact surface area $A_e = 1.85$ kpc$^{2}$, typical for galaxies at this epoch. We carefully model the rest-frame UV NIRSpec Prism spectrum around the Ly$\alpha$ edge, finding that the Ly$\alpha$ emission-line redshift is consistent with the longer-wavelength recombination lines and an escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc,Ly\alpha} = 30\%$ but that the broad DLA feature is not able to converge on the same redshift. Instead, our modelling suggests $z_{\rm abs}= 5.40 \pm 0.10$, the exact redshift of a newly identified proto-cluster in nearby projection to the target galaxy. We argue that most of the HI gas producing the strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing indeed has to be unassociated with the galaxy itself, and thus may indicate that we are probing the cold, dense circumcluster medium of this massive galaxy overdensity. These results provide an alternative solution to the recent claims of continuum nebular emission or an obscured active galactic nucleus dominating the rest-frame UV parts of the spectrum and provide further indications that strong DLAs might preferentially be associated with galaxy overdensities.

      <title>Relativistic Khronon Theory in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics and Large-Scale Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on a space-time foliation by three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces labeled by the Khronon scalar field $\tau$. We show that this theory (i) leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems; (ii) recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime; (iii) is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies at linear cosmological scales, where the theory reduces to a subset of the generalized dark matter (GDM) model. We compute the second order action on a Minkowski background and show that it contains the usual tensor modes of GR and a scalar degree of freedom with dispersion relation $\omega=0$. We find that the deconstrained Hamiltonian is bounded from below for wavenumbers larger than $\sim 10^{-31}\,\text{eV}$ and unbounded for smaller wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>No evidence for anisotropy in galaxy spin directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary clockwise/anticlockwise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ.</description>

      <title>Friedmann equations of the fractal apparent horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a fractal perspective, the entropy bound of gravitational systems undergoes changes. Furthermore, in the cosmological setting, the conservation law of a perfect fluid is also altered in such systems, affecting spatial elements like volume, area, and radius. By applying the first law of thermodynamics and deriving the Friedmann equations, we can gain insight into the evolution of such a fractal cosmos. However, observations continue to necessitate the existence of a dark energy source. To address this, in this article, we have created a novel fractal $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and determined the fractal cosmological observables. We show that the spatial fractal dimension is two, and the age of the Universe is 13.91 Gyr, by fitting the model's parameters to cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Null Energy Condition Violation from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a cornerstone of general relativity, and its violation could leave observable imprints in the cosmic gravitational wave spectrum. Theoretical models suggest that NEC violations during inflation can amplify the primordial tensor power spectrum, leading to distinct features in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we search for these NEC-violating signatures in the SGWB using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. Our analysis reveals no statistically significant evidence of such signals, allowing us to place stringent upper limits on the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. Specifically, we find that $P_{T,2} \lesssim 0.15$ at a $95\%$ confidence level. Notably, this upper limit is consistent with constraints derived from pulsar timing array observations, reinforcing the hypothesis that NEC violations during inflation could explain the signal detected by pulsar timing arrays. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the early Universe and highlight the potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments in probing the physics of inflation and NEC violations.</description>

      <title>Wave optics lensing of gravitational waves: theory and phenomenology of triple systems in the LISA band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study lensing of gravitational waves by a black hole in the deep wave optics regime, i.e. when the wavelength is much larger than the black hole Schwarzschild radius. We apply it to triple systems, with a binary of stellar mass objects in the inspiraling phase orbiting around a central massive black hole. We describe the full polarisation structure of the wave and derive predictions for the polarisation modes of the scattered wave measured by the observer. We show that lensing in the wave optics regime is not helicity preserving, as opposed to lensing in the geometric optics regime. The amplitude of the total wave is modulated due to interference between the directly transmitted and lensed components. The relative amplitude of the modulation is fixed by the lensing geometry and can reach unity in the most favourable settings. This indicates that wave optics lensing is potentially detectable by LISA for sufficiently high SNR systems. Our findings show that in the wave optics regime it is necessary to go beyond the usual lensing description where the amplification factor is assumed to be the same for both helicity modes. While motivated by GW190521 and the AGN formation scenario, our results apply more broadly to stellar-mass binaries orbiting a third body described as a Schwarzschild black hole, with a period comparable to the GW observation time.</description>

      <title>A gravitational constant transition within cepheids as supernovae calibrators can solve the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) using SNe Ia with Cepheids as calibrators yield a value of H0 which is in tension with the value inferred from the CMB and other higher redshift probes. In ref. [1], the authors proposed a rapid transition in the value of the effective Newtonian gravitational constant G in order to alleviate the Hubble tension. The transition point was chosen so as to only affect distance estimates to Hubble flow SNe. However, in this study, the authors made the assumption that SNe Ia peak luminosity $L$ increases with Chandrashekhar mass $M_c$. This hypothesis contradicts a previous semi-analytic study of SN light curves in the presence of G-transition [2] which found that $L\propto M_c^{-0.97}$. Motivated by the results of refs. [1] and [2], we propose a hypothesis of a sudden recent change in the effective G at an epoch which corresponds to a look-back distance between $\sim$ 7 - 80 Mpc. A transition in G at these distances would affect both our estimate of the distances to Cepheids in calibrator galaxies, as well as to the Hubble flow supernovae. Upon fitting the observational data to this hypothesis, we find three interesting results: (i) we find mild evidence for a G-transition at 22.4 Mpc (73 million years ago) which is preferred (using certain estimators) by the calibrator type Ia SNe data over no G-transition, (ii) the H0 parameter inferred under this hypothesis is in good agreement with the value obtained from the CMB for a 4% larger value of G at earlier times, thus potentially resolving the Hubble tension, (iii) we obtain a fit to the scaling relationship between SN peak luminosity $L$ and Chandrasekhar mass $M_c$, as $L\propto M_c^{-1.68 \pm 0.68}$, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the theoretical study of ref. [2]. We also discuss how other probes could be used to verify this transition in the value of G.</description>

      <title>On dataset tensions and signatures of new cosmological physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can new cosmic physics be uncovered through tensions amongst datasets? Tensions in parameter determinations amongst different types of cosmological observation, especially the `Hubble tension' between probes of the expansion rate, have been invoked as possible indicators of new physics, requiring extension of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm to resolve. Within a fully Bayesian framework, we show that the standard tension metric gives only part of the updating of model probabilities, supplying a data co-dependence term that must be combined with the Bayes factors of individual datasets. This shows that, on its own, a reduction of dataset tension under an extension to $\Lambda$CDM is insufficient to demonstrate that the extended model is favoured. Any analysis that claims evidence for new physics {\it solely} on the basis of alleviating dataset tensions should be considered incomplete and suspect. We describe the implications of our results for the interpretation of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift Constraints on the Effective Theory of Interacting Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys provide the necessary sensitivity to measure gravitational redshift, a general relativistic effect that generates a dipole in galaxy clustering data when correlating two distinct populations of galaxies. Here, we study the constraining power of gravitational redshift within the framework of the effective theory of interacting dark energy. This formalism describes linear cosmological perturbations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity with a limited number of free functions, and allows each particle species to be coupled differently to the gravitational sector. In this work, we focus on Horndeski theories with a non-minimal coupling of dark matter to the scalar degree of freedom, yielding a breaking of the weak equivalence principle for this cosmic component, a scenario that is yet untested. We show that the dipole generated by gravitational redshift significantly breaks degeneracies and tightens the constraints on the parameters of the effective theory compared to the standard redshift-space distortion analysis solely based on the even multipoles in the galaxy correlation function, with an improvement of up to $\sim 50\%$ for populations with a galaxy bias difference equal to 1. We make the Python package EF-TIGRE (Effective Field Theory of Interacting dark energy with Gravitational REdshift) developed for this work publicly available.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical scatter on the Epoch of Reionization [H I]$_{\rm 21cm}$ bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the first star-forming galaxies are the main drivers of cosmic reionization. It is usually assumed that there is a one-to-one relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) inside a galaxy and the host halo mass in semi-analytical/numerical modeling of large-scale ionization maps during the epoch of reionization. However, more accurate simulations and observations suggest that the SFR and ionizing luminosity in galaxies may vary considerably even if the host halo mass is the same. This astrophysical scatter can introduce an additional non-Gaussianity in the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ signal, which might not be captured adequately in the power spectrum. In this work, we have studied the impact of the scatter on the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectrum using semi-numerical simulations. We find that the scatter primarily affects small ionized regions, whereas the large ionized bubbles remain largely unaffected. Although, the fractional change in the [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectra due to the scatter is found to be more than a factor of $10$ at large scales ($\lesssim 1\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), it is found to be statistically insignificant. However, at small scales ($k\sim2.55$ Mpc$^{-1}$), we have found the impact due to the scatter to be high in magnitude ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \sim 1$) and statistically significant ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \gtrsim 5$) at neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$. We have also found that in the most optimistic scenario, SKA1-Low might be able to detect these signatures of astrophysical scatter, at $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 5\sigma$ detection significance for $\overline{x}_{\rm HI} \sim$ 0.8 and 0.9 respectively, for the equilateral [H I]$_{21\rm cm}$ bispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the astrophysical gravitational-wave background resulting from compact binary coalescences, focusing on Population III binary black holes. We exploit results of state-of-the-art simulations on the evolution of Population I-II and III binaries, considering a variety of initial condition and star formation rate models for the latter. The contribution from Population III binary black holes is found to be very small, with no effect on the gravitational-wave spectrum. A network of third-generation detectors will detect easier individual Population III binaries, due to their significantly higher masses, hence decreasing even further their residual contribution.</description>

Abstract: We develop methods to extract key dark energy information from cosmic distance measurements including the BAO scales and supernovae luminosity distances. Demonstrated using simulated datasets of the complete DESI, LSST and Roman surveys designed for BAO and SNe distance measurements, we show that using our method, the dynamical behaviour of the energy, pressure, equation of state (with its time derivative) of dark energy and the cosmic deceleration function can all be accurately recovered from high-quality data, which allows for robust diagnostic tests for dark energy models.</description>

Abstract: We extract key information of dark energy from current observations of BAO, OHD and $H_0$, and find hints of dynamical behaviour of dark energy. In particular, a dynamical dark energy model whose equation of state crosses $-1$ is favoured by observations.

      <title>New vacuum stability limit from cosmological history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of the electroweak vacuum imposes important constraints on new physics models. Such new physics models may introduce one or more new thermal phases with a lower free energy than that of the electroweak vacuum. In this case, the early universe may stay or have already evolved into one of these deeper vacuum states. We investigate this possibility in detail in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, and delineate the corresponding constraints in its parameter space. We also discuss the situation in supersymmetry as another example. To account for the possibility that the universe is trapped in a non-electroweak vacuum, we propose a procedure of calculating the vacuum stability limit efficiently.</description>

      <title>Impact of primordial black holes on the formation of the first stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers and the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\sim 10 - 100\ \rm M_\odot$) and supermassive regimes ($\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\ \rm M_\odot$). Although only a small fraction ($\lesssim 1\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is required to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in early structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine semi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible impact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into account two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial star formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the first star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of massive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that can explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent observations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with improved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to better understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation and their imprints in high-redshift observations.</description>
