      <title>Generative Language Models on Nucleotide Sequences of Human Genes</title>

Abstract: Language models, especially transformer-based ones, have achieved colossal success in NLP. To be precise, studies like BERT for NLU and works like GPT-3 for NLG are very important. If we consider DNA sequences as a text written with an alphabet of four letters representing the nucleotides, they are similar in structure to natural languages. This similarity has led to the development of discriminative language models such as DNABert in the field of DNA-related bioinformatics. To our knowledge, however, the generative side of the coin is still largely unexplored. Therefore, we have focused on the development of an autoregressive generative language model such as GPT-3 for DNA sequences. Since working with whole DNA sequences is challenging without extensive computational resources, we decided to conduct our study on a smaller scale and focus on nucleotide sequences of human genes rather than the whole DNA. This decision has not changed the structure of the problem, as both DNA and genes can be considered as 1D sequences consisting of four different nucleotides without losing much information and without oversimplification. Firstly, we systematically studied an almost entirely unexplored problem and observed that RNNs perform best, while simple techniques such as N-grams are also promising. Another beneficial point was learning how to work with generative models on languages we do not understand, unlike natural languages. The importance of using real-world tasks beyond classical metrics such as perplexity was noted. In addition, we examined whether the data-hungry nature of these models can be altered by selecting a language with minimal vocabulary size, four due to four different types of nucleotides. The reason for reviewing this was that choosing such a language might make the problem easier. However, in this study, we found that this did not change the amount of data required very much.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Mamba for Single-Cell Data: Efficient Context Learning with Biological Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.</description>
