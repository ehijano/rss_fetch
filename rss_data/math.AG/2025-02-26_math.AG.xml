      <title>A new proof of monomialisation from 3-folds to surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof of the foundational result, due to S. Cutkosky, on the existence of a monomialisation of a morphism from a 3-fold to a surface. Our proof brings to the fore the notion of log-Fitting ideals, and requires us to develop new methods related to Rank Theorems and log-Fitting ideals.</description>

      <title>Matrixwise (approach to unexpected hypersurfaces) Reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we provide a new method of proving the existence of a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$, with a general point of multiplicity $m$ and vanishing at a given set of points $Z$, by looking at weak combinatorics of a set $Z$. This method has a direct application in the theory of unexpected hypersurfaces, where many of the examples are based only on computer experiments.</description>

      <title>Some evidence for the existence of Ulrich bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of existence of Ulrich bundles on nonsingular projective varieties is posed here in weaker terms: either to find a K-theoretic solution, or to find one in the derived category of the variety. We observe that if any motivic vector bundle is algebraic, there is always a solution in the Grothendieck group. Also, by considering the derived problem, it is noted a formal way of producing Ulrich sheaves on a surface.</description>

      <title>Breaking the symmetry in excess intersection and an application to counting solutions of systems of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $n$ regular functions $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ on an $n$-dimensional variety $X$, and a subset $Z$ of $X$, we consider deformations of the set of zeroes of the $f_i$ of the form $f_1 - t^{r_1}g_1 = \cdots = f_n - t^{r_n}g_n = 0$ where the $g_i$ are generic, and study the number $N_Z$ of points which "move to" generic points of $Z$ as $t$ moves to $0$. We compute $N_Z$ in the case that each $r_i/r_{i+1} \gg 1$. This associates to every subvariety of $X$ an {\em asymmetric} variant of the dynamic intersection number defined by Lazarsfeld [Compos. Math. 43, 1981] a la Severi [Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. 26 (4), 1947]. We explicitly describe the "distinguished components" of this "ordered intersection" (i.e. all $Z$ such that $N_Z &gt; 0$), and give an explicit formula for $N_Z$ in terms of sums of products of various "degrees" of $Z$ (the "global" factors) and lengths of certain ideals in the local ring of $Z$ (the "local" factors). We also consider certain scenarios in which $N_Z$ can be computed in terms of associated Newton diagrams, and describe how these point towards inductive solutions to the "affine Bezout problem" of counting isolated solutions of systems of polynomials. As an illustration of our methods we compute the number of common tangent lines to $4$ general spheres in the affine $3$-space (which is known to be 12 due to Macdonald, Pach, and Theobald [Discrete Comput. Geom. 26 (1), 2001] via certain ordered intersection multiplicities on the corresponding Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Modular vector bundles on hyperk\"ahler manifolds of Debarre-Voisin type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a very general Debarre-Voisin fourfold. In this article, we prove that all the Schur functors of the restriction of the quotient bundle of Gr(6,10) to X are modular and polystable vector bundles. We also show that such bundles are atomic if and only if correspond to the symmetric power of the restriction of the quotient bundle. Moreover, we compute the Ext-groups of different modular vector bundles on X, and we find examples with 20 and 40 dimensional first Ext-group.</description>

      <title>Intersection numbers as mixed volumes of Newton-Okounkov bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we express any intersection number $(L_1\cdot\ldots\cdot L_d)$ of ample line bundles on an irreducible projective variety by the mixed volume $V(\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(L_1),\dots,\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(L_d))$ of their Newton--Okounkov bodies. The admissible flag $Y_\bullet$ of subvarieties is constructed by sections of the line bundles using Bertini's theorem, leaving a small possibility of changing the line bundles after the flag is fixed. The proof relies on the slice formula for Newton--Okounkov bodies and on mixed volume calculations in convex geometry.</description>

      <title>On the number of minimal and next-to-minimal weight codewords of toric codes over hypersimplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toric codes are a type of evaluation code introduced by J.P. Hansen in 2000. They are produced by evaluating (a vector space composed by) polynomials at the points of $(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^s$, the monomials of these polynomials being related to a certain polytope. Toric codes related to hypersimplices are the result of the evaluation of a vector space of homogeneous monomially square-free polynomials of degree $d$. The dimension and minimum distance of toric codes related to hypersimplices have been determined by Jaramillo et al. in 2021. The next-to-minimal weight in the case $d = 1$ has been determined by Jaramillo-Velez et al. in 2023, and has been determined in the cases where $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$, by Carvalho and Patanker in 2024. In this work we characterize and determine the number of minimal (respectively, next-to-minimal) weight codewords when $3 \leq d &lt; s$ (respectively, $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$).</description>

      <title>Meromorphic vector bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the stack of \textit{meromorphic} $G$-bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve. This object defines a correspondence between the Kottwitz stack $\mathfrak{B}(G)$ and $\operatorname{Bun}_G$. We expect it to play a crucial role in comparing the schematic and analytic versions of the geometric local Langlands categories. Our first main result is the identification of the generic Newton strata of ${\operatorname{Bun}}_G^{\operatorname{mer}}$ with the Fargues--Scholze charts $\mathcal{M}$. Our second main result is a generalization of Fargues' theorem in families. We call this the \textit{meromorphic comparison theorem}. It plays a key role in proving that the analytification functor is fully faithful. Along the way, we give new proofs to what we call the \textit{topological and schematic comparison theorems}. These say that the topologies of $\operatorname{Bun}_G$ and $\mathfrak{B}(G)$ are reversed and that the two stacks take the same values when evaluated on schemes.</description>

      <title>Categorical resolutions of filtered schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of the theorem by Kuznetsov and Lunts, stating that any separated scheme of finite type over a field of characteristic zero admits a categorical resolution of singularities. Their construction makes use of the fact that every variety (over a field of characteristic zero) can be resolved by a finite sequence of blow-ups along smooth centres. We merely require the existence of (projective) resolutions. To accomplish this we put the $\mathcal{A}$-spaces of Kuznetsov and Lunts in a different light, viewing them instead as schemes endowed with finite filtrations. The categorical resolution is then constructed by gluing together differential graded categories obtained from a hypercube of finite length filtered schemes.</description>

      <title>Injectives obstruct Fourier-Mukai functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use injectives as a big tilting object to obstruct liftability of exact functors to the $\dg$-level.
  We use the inclusion of injectives into the canonical heart as a replacement for tilting objects in computations of the characteristic morphism. Then we apply this construction to proofs of non-liftability of candidate non-Fourier-Mukai functors, i.e.\ functors that do not admit an $\Ainfty$/$\dg$-lift. This approach allows explicit computation of the obstruction against an $\Ainfty$-lift. We in particular observe that this computation gives for smooth degree $d&gt;2$ hypersurfaces an abundance of non-Fourier-Mukai functors.</description>

When $k$ is a real closed field, we prove that such a morphism induces a covering map on the rational points.</description>

      <title>Thom polynomials for singularities of maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a gentle introduction to a general theory of universal polynomials associated to classification of map-germs, called Thom polynomials. The theory was originated by Ren\'e Thom in the 1950s and has since been evolved in various aspects by many authors. In a nutshell, this is about intersection theory on certain moduli spaces, say `classifying spaces of mono/multi-singularities of maps', which provides consistent and deep insights into both classical and modern enumerative geometry with many potential applications.</description>

      <title>Blobbed topological recursion from extended loop equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $N\times N$ Hermitian matrix model with measure $d\mu_{E,\lambda}(M)=\frac{1}{Z} \exp(-\frac{\lambda N}{4} \mathrm{tr}(M^4)) d\mu_{E,0}(M)$, where $d\mu_{E,0}$ is the Gaussian measure with covariance $\langle M_{kl}M_{mn}\rangle=\frac{\delta_{kn}\delta_{lm}}{N(E_k+E_l)}$ for given $E_1,...,E_N&gt;0$. It was previously understood that this setting gives rise to two ramified coverings $x,y$ of the Riemann sphere strongly tied by $y(z)=-x(-z)$ and a family $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$ of meromorphic differentials conjectured to obey blobbed topological recursion due to Borot and Shadrin. We develop a new approach to this problem via a system of six meromorphic functions which satisfy extended loop equations. Two of these functions are symmetric in the preimages of $x$ and can be determined from their consistency relations. An expansion at $\infty$ gives global linear and quadratic loop equations for the $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$. These global equations provide the $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$ not only in the vicinity of the ramification points of $x$ but also in the vicinity of all other poles located at opposite diagonals $z_i+z_j=0$ and at $z_i=0$. We deduce a recursion kernel representation valid at least for $g\leq 1$.</description>

Abstract: This is a survey article featuring some of Wolmer Vasconcelos' contributions to commutative algebra, and explaining how Vasconcelos' work and insights have contributed to the development of commutative algebra and its interaction with other areas to the present. We discuss the Vasconcelos' function and the Vasconcelos' number (v-number for short) of graded ideals and their relation to coding theory, and the interplay of Simis and normal monomial ideals with combinatorial optimization problems, blowup algebras, and resurgence theory. The regularity of subrings of normal k-uniform monomial ideals is shown to be a monotone function, and we give a normality criterion for edge ideals of graphs using Ehrhart rings.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian compact Lie group. In this paper we compute the spectrum of invariant prime ideals of the $A$-equivariant Lazard ring, or equivalently the spectrum of points of the moduli stack of $A$-equivariant formal groups. We further show that this spectrum is homeomorphic to the Balmer spectrum of compact $A$-spectra, with the comparison map induced by equivariant complex bordism homology.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal Elliptic Threefolds at Infinite Distance I: Log Calabi-Yau Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite-distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. In F-theory compactifications to six dimensions, such limits include infinite-distance trajectories in the non-perturbative open string moduli space. The limits are described as degenerations of elliptic threefolds whose central elements exhibit non-minimal elliptic fibers, in the Kodaira sense, over curves on the base. We show how these non-crepant singularities can be removed by a systematic sequence of blow-ups of the base, leading to a union of log Calabi-Yau spaces glued together along their boundaries. We identify criteria for the blow-ups to give rise to open chains or more complicated trees of components and analyse the blow-up geometry. While our results are general and applicable to all non-minimal degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds in codimension one, we exemplify them in particular for elliptic threefolds over Hirzebruch surface base spaces. We also explain how to extract the gauge algebra for F-theory probing such reducible asymptotic geometries. This analysis is the basis for a detailed F-theory interpretation of the associated infinite-distance limits that will be provided in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal Elliptic Threefolds at Infinite Distance II: Asymptotic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret infinite-distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of F-theory compactifications to six dimensions in the light of general ideas in quantum gravity. The limits we focus on arise from non-minimal singularities in the elliptic fiber over curves in a Hirzebruch surface base, which do not admit a crepant resolution. Such degenerations take place along infinite directions in the non-perturbative brane moduli space in F-theory. A blow-up procedure, detailed generally in Part I of this project, gives rise to an internal space consisting of a union of log Calabi-Yau threefolds glued together along their boundaries. We geometrically classify the resulting configurations for genus-zero single infinite-distance limits. Special emphasis is put on the structure of singular fibers in codimension zero and one. As our main result, we interpret the central fiber of these degenerations as endpoints of a decompactification limit with six-dimensional defects. The conclusions rely on an adiabatic limit to gain information on the asymptotically massless states from the structure of vanishing cycles. We also compare our analysis to the heterotic dual description where available. Our findings are in agreement with general expectations from quantum gravity and provide further evidence for the Emergent String Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Density Property for Generalized Calogero--Moser Spaces with Inner Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the density property for generalized Calogero--Moser spaces with inner degrees of freedom. This allows us to describe the holomorphic automorphism group of these complex affine manifolds. These generalized Calogero--Moser spaces can also be understood as quiver varieties corresponding to moduli spaces of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ instantons on a non-commutative $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Integral canonical models of exceptional Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Shimura varieties admit integral canonical models for sufficiently large primes. In the case of abelian-type Shimura varieties, this recovers work of Kisin-Kottwitz for sufficiently large primes. We also prove the existence of integral canonical models for images of period maps corresponding to geometric families. We deduce several consequences from this, including an unramified rigid analogue of Borel's extension theorem, a version of Tate semisimplicity, CM lifting theorems, and a weakened version of Tate's isogeny theorem for ordinary points.</description>

      <title>Frobenius intertwiners for q-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundles over projective spaces $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $(q,z)\to (q^p,z^p)$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in terms of the $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ we arrive at the Frobenius structures for the $p$-adic hypergeometric and Bessel differential equations studied by Dwork. In particular, we find closed formulas for $p$-adic constants appearing in works of Dwork and Sperber in terms of $p$-adic zeta functions.</description>
