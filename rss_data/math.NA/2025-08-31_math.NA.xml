      <title>Preconditioned pseudo-time continuation for parameterized inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parametrized variational inverse problems that are constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs). We seek to efficiently compute the solution of the inverse problem when auxiliary model parameters, which appear in the governing PDE, are varied. Computing the solution of the inverse problem for different auxiliary parameter values is crucial for uncertainty quantification. This, however, is computationally challenging since it requires solving many optimization problems for different realizations of the auxiliary parameters. We leverage pseudo-time continuation and solve an initial value problem to evolve the optimal solution along an auxiliary parameter path. This article introduces the use of an adaptive quasi-Newton Hessian preconditioner to accelerate the computation. Our proposed preconditioner exploits properties of the pseudo-time continuation process to achieve reliable and efficient computation. We elaborate our proposed framework and elucidate its properties for two nonlinear inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable finite difference (ESFD) methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity (ECAV) and knapsack limiting (KL) techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality.
  In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</description>

      <title>Machine-precision energy conservative quadrature hyperreduction of Lagrangian hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum singular value transformation with application in quantum bi-conjugate gradient method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) are essential tools for implementing the block encoding of matrix functions. The achievable polynomials of QSP have restrictions on parity, while GQSP eliminates these restrictions. In this paper, we further investigate GQSP and present a quantum bi-conjugate gradient (BiCG) algorithm as an application. First, we extend GQSP, which constructs functions of unitary matrices, to general matrices. We refer to this extension as generalized quantum singular value transformation (GQSVT). Subsequently, we implement the quantum BiCG method, utilizing GQSVT and swap test, which has a relatively shallow circuit depth and requires a small number of ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>A Biologically Motivated Finite Difference Approach for Simulating Singularly Perturbed Vertical Motion in Human Gait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a simulation-based numerical method for solving a class of singularly perturbed second-order differential equations that come from a simplified biologically motivated model of human gait. Important physical factors such as gravity, damping, and leg stiffness are included in the model, which also depicts the vertical motion of the center of mass of the body during walking or running. Most of the time, standard numerical methods are ineffective in resolving boundary layer behavior that occurs due to the small perturbation parameter in the governing equation. We use a domain decomposition technique to divide the problem domain into inner and outer regions to tackle this difficulty. The boundary layer resolves the steep gradients. We applied a time-rescaling transformation to the inner region. Each subdomain is discretized, and the resulting tridiagonal systems are efficiently solved using the Thomas algorithm within the mixed finite difference framework. A detailed convergence analysis demonstrates second-order accuracy in space. The numerical results validate the proposed scheme's accuracy, stability, and efficiency through experiments based on modified human gait models. The framework serves as a fundamental tool for biomechanical simulation. The modeling is a foundation for future research, incorporating nonlinearities, time delays, and real-world scenarios data on how people walk.</description>

      <title>Computing Radially-Symmetric Solutions of the Ultra-Relativistic Euler Equations with Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra--relativistic Euler equations describe gases in the relativistic case when the thermal energy dominates. These equations for an ideal gas are given in terms of the pressure, the spatial part of the dimensionless four-velocity, and the particle density. Kunik et al.\ (2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113330) proposed genuine multi--dimensional benchmark problems for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. In particular, they compared full two-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin simulations for radially symmetric problems with solutions computed using a specific one-dimensional scheme. Of particular interest in the solutions are the formation of shock waves and a pressure blow-up. In the present work we derive an entropy-stable flux for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. Therefore, we derive the main field (or entropy variables) and the corresponding potentials. We then present the entropy-stable flux and conclude with simulation results for different test cases both in 2D and in 3D.</description>

      <title>Inverse Random Source Problem for the Helmholtz Equation from Statistical Phaseless Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of reconstructing a random source from statistical phaseless data for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The major challenge of this problem is non-uniqueness, which we overcome through a reference source technique. Firstly, we introduce some artificially added point sources into the inverse random source system and derive phase retrieval (PR) formulas for the expectation and variance of the radiated fields. This paper rigorously analyze the uniqueness and stability of the recovered statistics of the radiated fields. Afterwards, since the direct problem has a unique mild solution, by examining the expectation and variance of this solution and combined with the phase retrieval formulas, we derive the Fredholm integral equations to solve the inverse random source problem (IRSP). We prove the stability of the corresponding integral equations. To quantify the uncertainty of the random source, we utilize the Bayesian method to reconstruct the random source and establish the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The Derivative of Kemeny's Constant as a Centrality Measure in Undirected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant quantifies a graph's connectivity by measuring the average time for a random walker to reach any other vertex. We introduce two concepts of the directional derivative of Kemeny's constant with respect to an edge and use them to define centrality measures for edges and non-edges in the graph. Additionally, we present a sensitivity measure of Kemeny's constant. An explicit expression for these quantities involving the inverse of the modified graph Laplacian is provided, which is valid even for cut-edges. These measures are connected to the one introduced in [Altafini et al., SIMAX 2023], and algorithms for their computation are included. The benefits of these measures are discussed, along with applications to road networks and link prediction analysis. For one-path graphs, an explicit expression for these measures is given in terms of the edge weights.</description>

      <title>Random domain decomposition for parabolic PDEs on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of complex systems, such as gas transport in large pipeline networks, often involves solving PDEs posed on intricate graph structures. Such problems require considerable computational and memory resources. The Random Batch Method (RBM) has shown promise in addressing these challenges via stochastic decomposition techniques. In this paper, we apply the RBM at the PDE level for parabolic equations on graphs, without assuming any preliminary discretization in space or time. We consider a non-overlapping domain decomposition in which the PDE coefficients and source terms are randomized. We prove that the resulting RBM-based scheme converges, in the mean-square sense and uniformly in time, to the true PDE solution with first-order accuracy in the RBM step size. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence rate and demonstrate substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time compared to solving on the full graph. Moreover, these advantages persist across different time discretization schemes.</description>

      <title>Conforming and discontinuous discretizations of non-isothermal Darcy-Forchheimer flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze in a unified setting two schemes for the numerical discretization of a Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow model coupled with an advection-diffusion equation modeling the temperature distribution in the fluid. The first approach is based on fully discontinuous Galerkin discretization spaces. In contrast, in the second approach, the velocity is approximated in the Raviart-Thomas space, and the pressure and temperature are still piecewise discontinuous. A fixed-point linearization strategy, naturally inducing an iterative splitting solution, is proposed for treating the nonlinearities of the problem. We present a unified stability analysis and prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm under mild requirements on the problem data. A wide set of two- and three-dimensional simulations is presented to assess the error decay and demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed approaches in physically sound test cases.</description>

      <title>Trajectory learning for ensemble forecasts via the continuous ranked probability score: a Lorenz '96 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss function. Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts. This approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to its accuracy over short lead times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel convex-non-convex formulation of the image segmentation and the image completion problems. The proposed approach is based on the minimization of a functional involving two distinct regularization terms: one promotes low-rank structure in the solution, while the other one enforces smoothness. To solve the resulting optimization problem, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A detailed convergence analysis of the algorithm is provided, and the performance of the methods is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</description>

      <title>Faster Linear Algebra Algorithms with Structured Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To achieve the greatest possible speed, practitioners regularly implement randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression with structured dimension reduction maps. Despite significant research effort, basic questions remain about the design and analysis of randomized linear algebra algorithms that employ structured random matrices.
  This paper develops a new perspective on structured dimension reduction, based on the oblivious subspace injection (OSI) property. The OSI property is a relatively weak assumption on a random matrix that holds when the matrix preserves the length of vectors on average and, with high probability, does not annihilate any vector in a low-dimensional subspace. With the OSI abstraction, the analysis of a randomized linear algebra algorithm factors into two parts: (i) proving that the algorithm works when implemented with an OSI; and (ii) proving that a given random matrix model has the OSI property.
  This paper develops both parts of the program. First, it analyzes standard randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression under the OSI assumption. Second, it identifies many examples of OSIs, including random sparse matrices, randomized trigonometric transforms, and random matrices with tensor product structure. These theoretical results imply faster, near-optimal runtimes for several fundamental linear algebra tasks. The paper also provides guidance on implementation, along with empirical evidence that structured random matrices offer exemplary performance for a range of synthetic problems and contemporary scientific applications.</description>

      <title>LREI: A fast numerical solver for quantum Landau-Lifshitz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.</description>

      <title>A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods for Wide Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks trained by stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Block Encoding of Sparse Matrices via Coherent Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>SlabLU: A Two-Level Sparse Direct Solver for Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper describes a sparse direct solver for the linear systems that arise from the discretization of an elliptic PDE on a two dimensional domain. The scheme decomposes the domain into thin subdomains, or ``slabs'' and uses a two-level approach that is designed with parallelization in mind. The scheme takes advantage of $\mathcal H^2$-matrix structure emerging during factorization and utilizes randomized algorithms to efficiently recover this structure. As opposed to multi-level nested dissection schemes that incorporate the use of $\mathcal H$ or $\mathcal H^2$ matrices for a hierarchy of front sizes, SlabLU is a two-level scheme which only uses $\mathcal H^2$-matrix algebra for fronts of roughly the same size. The simplicity allows the scheme to be easily tuned for performance on modern architectures and GPUs.
  The solver described is compatible with a range of different local discretizations, and numerical experiments demonstrate its performance for regular discretizations of rectangular and curved geometries. The technique becomes particularly efficient when combined with very high-order accurate multi-domain spectral collocation schemes. With this discretization, a Helmholtz problem on a domain of size $1000 \lambda \times 1000 \lambda$ (for which $N=100 \rm{M}$) is solved in 15 minutes to 6 correct digits on a high-powered desktop with GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Convergence and long-time behavior of finite volumes for a generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck system with cross-diffusion and size exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite volume scheme for modeling the diffusion of charged particles, specifically ions, in constrained geometries using a degenerate Poisson-Nernst-Planck system with size exclusion yielding cross-diffusion. Our method utilizes a two-point flux approximation and is part of the exponentially fitted scheme framework. The scheme is shown to be thermodynamically consistent, as it ensures the decay of some discrete version of the free energy. Classical numerical analysis results -- existence of discrete solution, convergence of the scheme as the grid size and the time step go to $0$ -- follow. We also investigate the long-time behavior of the scheme, both from a theoretical and numerical point of view. Numerical simulations confirm our findings, but also point out some possibly very slow convergence towards equilibrium of the system under consideration.</description>

      <title>Optimal error bounds on an exponential wave integrator Fourier spectral method for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a nearly optimal error bound on the exponential wave integrator Fourier spectral (EWI-FS) method for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (LogSE) under the assumption of $H^2$-solution, which is theoretically guaranteed. Subject to a CFL-type time step size restriction $\tau |\ln \tau| \lesssim h^2/|\ln h|$ for obtaining the stability of the numerical scheme affected by the singularity of the logarithmic nonlinearity, an $L^2$-norm error bound of order $O(\tau |\ln \tau|^2 + h^2 |\ln h|)$ is established, where $\tau$ is the time step size and $h$ is the mesh size. Compared to the error estimates of the LogSE in the literature, our error bound either greatly improves the convergence rate under the same regularity assumptions or significantly weakens the regularity requirement to obtain the same convergence rate. Moreover, our result can be directly applied to the LogSE with low regularity $L^\infty$-potential, which is not allowed in the existing error estimates. Two main ingredients are adopted in the proof: (i) an $H^2$-conditional $L^2$-stability estimate, which is established using the energy method to avoid singularity of the logarithmic nonlinearity, and (ii) mathematical induction with inverse inequalities to control the $H^2$-norm of the numerical solution. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates and demonstrate the necessity of the time step size restriction imposed. We also apply the EWI-FS method to investigate soliton collisions in one dimension and vortex dipole dynamics in two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents research conducted at the University of Trento addressing an industrial challenge from Fater S.p.A. regarding the thermal bonding of non-woven fabrics for diaper production. The problem consists in a possible analysis of the behavior of the bonding process of a non-woven fabric. In particular, the bonding process is not given by the use of some kind of glue, but just by the pressure of two fiber webs through two high-velocity steel-made rollers. The research comprised the formulation and theoretical as well as numerical analysis of analytical, mechanical and thermal models for the stress-strain behavior of the non-woven fabric's fibers and for the bonding process with heating effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and easy-to-implement gradient-enhanced least squares Monte Carlo method for computing price and Greeks (i.e., derivatives of the price function) of high-dimensional American options. It employs the sparse Hermite polynomial expansion as a surrogate model for the continuation value function, and essentially exploits the fast evaluation of gradients. The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted $H^1$ space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural network-based methods up to dimension 100.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a control-oriented optimal experimental design (cOED) approach for linear PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems. In particular, we consider optimal control problems with uncertain parameters that need to be estimated by solving an inverse problem, which in turn requires measurement data. We consider the case where data is collected at a set of sensors. While classical Bayesian OED techniques provide experimental designs (sensor placements) that minimize the posterior uncertainty in the inversion parameter, these designs are not tailored to the demands of the optimal control problem. In the present control-oriented setting, we prioritize the designs that minimize the uncertainty in the state variable being controlled or the control objective. We propose a mathematical framework for uncertainty quantification and cOED for parameterized PDE-constrained optimal control problems with linear dependence to the control variable and the inversion parameter. We also present scalable computational methods for computing control-oriented sensor placements and for quantifying the uncertainty in the control objective. Additionally, we present illustrative numerical results in the context of a model problem motivated by heat transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time Bayesian inference at extreme scale: A digital twin for tsunami early warning applied to the Cascadia subduction zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inversion-based digital twin that employs acoustic pressure data from seafloor sensors, along with 3D coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer earthquake-induced spatiotemporal seafloor motion in real time and forecast tsunami propagation toward coastlines for early warning with quantified uncertainties. Our target is the Cascadia subduction zone, with one billion parameters. Computing the posterior mean alone would require 50 years on a 512 GPU machine. Instead, exploiting the shift invariance of the parameter-to-observable map and devising novel parallel algorithms, we induce a fast offline-online decomposition. The offline component requires just one adjoint wave propagation per sensor; using MFEM, we scale this part of the computation to the full El Capitan system (43,520 GPUs) with 92% weak parallel efficiency. Moreover, given real-time data, the online component exactly solves the Bayesian inverse and forecasting problems in 0.2 seconds on a modest GPU system, a ten-billion-fold speedup.</description>

Abstract: In this work, based on the $3+1$ decomposition in [24, 33], we present a fully exterior calculus breakdown of spacetime and Einstein's equations. Links to the orthonormal frame approach [38] are drawn to help understand the variables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested using the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [13], and some discrete quantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}^d$ denote the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the problem of optimally recovering a target function $f^*:\mathbb{T}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ from samples of its Fourier coefficients. We make classical smoothness assumptions on $f^*$, specifically that $f^*$ lies in a Besov space $B^s_\infty(L_q)$ with $s &gt; 0$ and $1\leq q\leq \infty$, and measure recovery error in the $L_p$-norm with $1\leq p\leq \infty$. Abstractly, the optimal recovery error is characterized by a `restricted' version of the Gelfand widths, which we call the Fourier sampling numbers. Up to logarithmic factors, we determine the correct asymptotics of the Fourier sampling numbers in the regime $s/d &gt; 1 - 1/p$. We also give a description of nearly optimal Fourier measurements and recovery algorithms in each of these cases. In the other direction, we prove a novel lower bound showing that there is an asymptotic gap between the Fourier sampling numbers and the Gelfand widths when $q = 1$ and $p_0 &lt; p\leq 2$ with $p_0 \approx 1.535$. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results, which imply a sharper recovery of edges, and provide numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon.</description>
