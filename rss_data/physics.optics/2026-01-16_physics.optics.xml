      <title>Free-space Optical Diffraction and the Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the transport-of-intensity approach for free-space optical propagation in the paraxial regime, we show that diffraction is fundamentally related to the Fisher information associated with models of the transverse intensity distribution. By interpreting intensity as a probability density, we show that a) free-space diffraction will always act to flatten the intensity distribution as the beam propagates, and consequently b) diffraction will monotonically minimize the Fisher Information with respect to any parameterization of the intensity distribution model that depends on propagation distance.</description>

      <title>Programmable on-chip synthesis and reconstruction of partially coherent two-mode optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially coherent light is typically studied in the context of freely propagating continuous fields. Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Engineering for Scintillation-Based Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in nanophotonics for scintillation-based imaging has demonstrated promising improvements in scintillator performance. In parallel, advances in nanophotonics have enabled wavefront control through metasurfaces, a capability that has transformed fields such as microscopy by allowing tailored control of optical propagation. This naturally raises the following question, which we address in this perspective: can wavefront-control strategies be leveraged to improve scintillation-based imaging? To answer this question, we explore nanophotonic- and metasurface-enabled wavefront control in scintillators to mitigate image blurring arising from their intrinsically diffuse light emission. While depth-of-field extension in scintillation faces fundamental limitations absent in microscopy, this approach reveals promising avenues, including stacked scintillators, selective spatial-frequency enhancement, and X-ray energy-dependent imaging. These results clarify the key distinctions in adapting wavefront engineering to scintillation and its potential to enable tailored detection strategies.</description>

      <title>Variable coherence model for free-electron laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the variable coherence model (VCM) for simulating free-electron laser (FEL) pulses generated through self-amplified spontaneous emission. Building on the established partial coherence model of [T. Pfeifer et. al, Opt. Lett. 35, 3441 (2010)], we demonstrate that the implementation of a variable coherence width allows for continuous control over the pulses' characteristic noise, while keeping the average pulse parameters such as the bandwidth fixed. We demonstrate this through systematic statistical analyses of the intensity and number of sub-pulses in VCM pulses, in both time and frequency. In particular, we analyze how the sub-pulse statistics are affected by the coherence width parameter. We perform our analyses across three distinct regimes of FEL parameters and demonstrate how the VCM can generate pulses that range from maximally random to fully coherent. Finally, we illustrate the effect of the VCM variable coherence width on an absorption simulation.</description>

      <title>Near-Unity-Efficiency Gas Gratings for Ultraviolet, Visible, and Infrared High-Power Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfering deep ultraviolet (DUV) lasers can induce substantial density modulations in an ozone-doped gas flow via photochemical reactions, creating volume diffraction gratings. These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications.</description>

      <title>An Exact Energy Conservation Law for Magneto-Optical Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy conservation imposes fundamental bounds on the polarizabilities of nanoparticles (NPs). While such bounds are well established for isotropic and bianisotropic NPs, they remain unexplored for magneto-optical NPs. Here, we derive the exact energy-conservation law governing the electric and magnetic dipolar response of axially symmetric magneto-optical NPs under general illumination conditions and arbitrary external magnetic fields. Two central results follow from energy conservation: (i) purely magneto-optical scattering, where the non-magnetic polarizability vanishes, is fundamentally forbidden, and (ii) strong magneto-optical scattering regimes, in which the magneto-optical polarizability dominates, are intriguingly allowed.</description>

      <title>Pulse thermal imaging of FUHAO bronze artifact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification of historical restoration traces and material degradation is essential for the scientific preservation of ancient bronzes. In this study, the prestigious FUHAO bronze artifact (late Shang period, 13th-11th century BCE) was non-destructively examined using pulsed thermal imaging (PT). By combining single- and double-layer heat conduction models with Thermal Tomography (TT), this approach allowed for precise spatial localization of repair crevices, patches, and filler materials, while also distinguishing restorative interventions from the original bronze substrate. The artifact was revealed to have been assembled from multiple fragments, exhibiting uneven surface corrosion and clear evidence of prior conservation. The results not only provide direct insights for conservation strategy and historical interpretation but also demonstrate the capability of pulsed thermal imaging as an effective diagnostic tool for the integrated surface and subsurface assessment of cultural heritage objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum bianisotropy in light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-based high-speed and high-definition full-field dynamic optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural-network (NN)-based method for high-speed, high-definition dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) using full-field swept-source optical coherence microscopy (FF-SS-OCM) is demonstrated. FF-SS-OCM provides high-definition OCT images, but, particularly in DOCT imaging, it results in a significant enlargement of the data size and subsequently long data streaming and processing time, which prevents high-throughput imaging. We address this issue by introducing an NN-based DOCT method that generates high-definition logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) -based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes, whereas the conventional method required 32 volumes. The NN model successfully generates an LIV image that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the LIV image computed from 32 volumes. This approach significantly reduces data size, transfer time, and processing time for DOCT imaging by a factor of eight. Specifically, these were reduced from 42 GB to 5.3 GB, 7 min to 55 s, and 4 hours to 30 min, respectively.</description>

      <title>Observation of Light-Driven Levitation Near Epsilon-Near-Zero Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles near surfaces is fundamental for applications in sensing and microfluidics, yet controlling particle-surface interactions remains challenging. Here we experimentally investigate light-induced forces on dielectric particles near epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial surfaces using photonic force microscopy. By illuminating trapped particles with tunable visible light, we observe a wavelength-dependent repulsive force unique to ENZ surfaces, contrasting with the attractive forces near dielectric or metallic substrates. This repulsion peaks near the ENZ frequency and may be attributed to combined optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces. Our findings demonstrate that ENZ metamaterials can induce stable levitation of particles via light-driven forces, offering a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation in microfluidic environments. This work advances understanding of light-matter interactions at ENZ interfaces and suggests potential for ENZ-based optical control of micro- and nanoscale objects, with potential applications in micro- and nanofluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectrally tailored multimode metasurface lasers in the visible range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrally engineered multifrequency nanolasers are highly desirable for on-chip photonics, multiplexed biosensing, and display technologies; yet, achieving them within a single compact platform remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate multimode lasing from symmetry-broken TiO2 metasurfaces integrated with an SU8 slab waveguide containing Rhodamine 6G. By co-engineering guided-mode resonances, surface lattice resonances near Rayleigh anomalies, and quasi-bound states in the continuum, we realize complementary high-Q feedback pathways that overlap with the gain spectrum. The direction of the lasing emission is tailored through outcoupling via second-order Bragg diffraction and Rayleigh anomaly conditions, supporting both normal and oblique emission. Experiments reveal discrete lasing outputs across ~100 nm bandwidth (548-648 nm), spanning nearly the full Rhodamine 6G emission band, with thresholds as low as ~7 nJ per pulse (35.7 uJ/cm^2) and up to four concurrent lasing peaks from a single device. These results establish a metasurface-dye platform for multifrequency and angle-selective lasing, opening new opportunities for compact, multifunctional nanophotonic sources.</description>

      <title>Optimal universal bounds for waves with varied coherence based on supremum and infimum coherence spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a majorization-based theory for bounding observables of waves with varied coherence. For any measurement, exact bounds are attained by the maximal and minimal elements in the set of input coherence spectra. The set's supremum and infimum, which may lie outside the set, provide optimal universal bounds: any alternative spectrum yielding universal bounds produces weaker constraints. We present an algorithm to compute the supremum and infimum, and prove that they lie either at singular boundary points or strictly outside the set of coherence spectra.</description>

      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>Multi-level quantum emitter in an optical waveguide: paradoxes and resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon statistics plays a governing role in multi-photon interference. While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics. This trade-off implies that quantum and classical advantages are mutually exclusive resources for interference, indicating a form of statistical complementarity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criteria for Complete Mode Conversion in Detuned Systems via Piecewise-Coherent Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic frequency comb Doppler thermometry</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.</description>

      <title>Mitigating nonlinear transduction noise in high-cooperativity cavity optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C&gt;n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the inter-membrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-P\'{e}rot and inter-membrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the collective motion of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal thermalization and adiabatic cooling of guided light waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically characterize three-dimensional spatio-temporal thermalization of a continuous-wave classical light beam propagating along a multi-mode optical waveguide. By combining a non-equilibrium kinetic approach based on the wave turbulence theory and numerical simulations of the field equations, we anticipate that thermalizing scattering events are dramatically accelerated by the combination of strong transverse confinement with the continuous nature of the temporal degrees of freedom. In connection with the blackbody catastrophe, the thermalization of the classical field in the continuous temporal direction provides an intrinsic mechanism for adiabatic cooling and, then, spatial beam condensation. Our results open new avenues in the direction of a simultaneous spatial and temporal beam cleaning.</description>

      <title>Canonical Clocks and Hidden Geometric Freedom in Self-Imaging</title>

Abstract: Self-imaging represents a core hallmark of paraxial (quadratic)-wave evolution; yet, across its many realizations and generalizations over the past two centuries, the uniformity of recurrence planes along the propagation axis has been considered fundamental. However, by reframing the general phenomenon of self-imaging within its natural symplectic framework, we show that all self-imaging effects are necessarily tied to uniformly periodic recurrences in the canonical evolution coordinate -- metaplectic time -- and that the correspondence of that coordinate to the physical propagation axis represents an unexplored degree of freedom, which can be engineered arbitrarily by the initial transverse phase structure. Using a single programmable spatial light modulator, we demonstrate the construction of Talbot carpets characterized by recurrence spacings that accelerate and decelerate along the propagation axis, as well as those that follow polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal axial trajectories, all of which preserve exact reconstruction in the canonical metaplectic time. These results establish metaplectic time as the fundamental invariant of self-imaging and reveal a regime of controllable axial dynamics previously thought to be fixed.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Communications Using Effective-Medium-Slot Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-dielectric effective-medium-clad waveguides have been widely exploited in terahertz communications owing to their extremely low loss, low dispersion, and broad bandwidth. In this work, we propose a substrateless effective-medium-slot waveguide. Additionally, we introduce a taper-free interface that allows terahertz waves to directly couple from a metallic hollow waveguide without requiring dielectric insertion. By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems.</description>

      <title>Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic exploration of amorphous ABC heterostructures revealed that nanoscale morphological modifications markedly improved their artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>
