      <title>A Fox-Neuwirth Basis for the Sinha Spectral Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sinha defined a spectral sequence approximating the (co)homology of the space of long knots in R^m modulo immersions, stemming from a cosimplicial structure on the compactified configuration spaces \`a la Kontsevich. We provide an equivalent cosimplicial structure on (the barycentric subdivision of) a regular CW complex with cells indexed by Fox-Neuwirth trees. As a corollary, we give a combinatorial presentation of the Sinha Spectral Sequence in terms of Fox-Neuwirth trees for all dimensions m&gt;=2 and all coefficients.</description>

      <title>An application of the hit problem to the algebraic transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_k$ be the polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ over the field $\mathbb F_2$ with two elements, in $k$ variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_k$, each variable of degree 1. Denote by $GL_k$ the general linear group over $\mathbb F_2$ which regularly acts on $P_k$. The algebra $P_k$ is a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A$. In 1989, Singer [22] defined the $k$-th homological algebraic transfer, which is a homomorphism $$\varphi_k=(\varphi_k)_m :{\rm Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+m} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2) \to (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_m^{GL_k}$$ from the homological group of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+m} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$ to the subspace $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_m^{GL_k}$ of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $m$. In general, the transfer $\varphi_k$ is not a monomorphism and Singer made a conjecture that $\varphi_k$ is an epimorphism for any $k \geqslant 0$. The conjecture is studied by many authors. It is true for $k \leqslant 3$ but unknown for $k \geqslant 4$.
  In this paper, by using the results of the Peterson hit problem for the polynomial algebra in four variables, we prove that Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer is true in the families of generic degrees $d_{s,t} = 2^{s+t}+2^s-3$ and $n_{s,t}=2^{s+t}+2^s-2$ with $s,\, t$ positive integers. Our results also show that many of the results in Ph\'uc [16,17,18] are seriously false. The proofs of the results in Ph\'uc's works are only provided for a few special cases but they are false and incomplete.</description>

      <title>A modern perspective on rational homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Quillen's paper on rational homotopy theory, the category of 1-reduced simplicial sets is endowed with a family of model structures, the most prominent of which is the one whose weak equivalences are the rational homotopy equivalences. In this paper, we give a modern approach to this family of model structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\pi_n$-wild set $\mathbf{w}_{n}(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is the subspace of $X$ consisting of the points at which there exists a shrinking sequence of essential based maps $S^n\to X$. In this paper, we show that the homotopy type of $\mathbf{w}_{n}(X)$ is a homotopy invariant of $X$ and, in analogy to the known one-dimensional case, we show that for certain $n$-dimensional $\pi_n$-shape injective metric spaces, the homeomorphism type of $\mathbf{w}_{n}(X)$ is a homotopy invariant of $X$. We also prove that the $\pi_n$-wild set of a Peano continuum can be homeomorphic to any compact metric space.</description>

      <title>2-Segal sets and pseudomonoids in the bicategory of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey article, we give an introduction to the notion of a 2-Segal set and prove that 2-Segal sets are equivalent to pseudomonoids in the bicategory of spans. The proof utilizes graphical techniques for 2-Segal sets and spans that should be useful in more general settings.
  There are procedures for obtaining an associative algebra from a 2-Segal set (satisfying finiteness conditions). We describe these procedures and give several examples of algebras arising from 2-Segal sets.
  Wherever possible, we avoid higher category theory so as to make the paper accessible to a wide audience.</description>

      <title>A Homotopical Invariant of Weinstein Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One generally expects that the techniques of arboreal singularities and gluing of local differential graded categories will result in a useful global invariant for all Weinstein manifolds. In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional generalization of Youngs' theorem and circular colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1996, Youngs proved that any quadrangulation of the real projective plane is not 3-chromatic. This result has been extended in various directions over the years, including to other non-orientable closed surfaces, higher-dimensional analogues of quadrangulations and circular colorings. In this paper, we provide a generalization which yields some of these extensions of Youngs' theorem.</description>

      <title>Equivariant and Invariant Parametrized Topological Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $G$-equivariant fibration $p \colon E\to B$, we introduce and study the invariant analogue of Cohen, Farber and Weinberger's parametrized topological complexity, called the invariant parametrized topological complexity. This notion generalizes the invariant topological complexity introduced by Lubawski and Marzantowicz. We establish the equivariant fibrewise homotopy invariance of this notion and derive several bounds, including a cohomological lower bound and a dimensional upper bound. Additionally, we compare invariant parametrized topological complexity with other well-known invariants. When $G$ is a compact Lie group acting freely on $E$, we show that the invariant parametrized topological complexity of the $G$-fibration $p \colon E\to B$ coincides with the parametrized topological complexity of the induced fibration $\overline{p} \colon \overline{E} \to \overline{B}$ between the orbit spaces. Finally, we compute the invariant parametrized topological complexity of equivariant Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations, which measures the complexity of motion planning in presence of obstacles having unknown positions such that the order in which they are placed is irrelevant.
  Apart from this, we establish several bounds, including a cohomological lower bound, an equivariant homotopy dimension-connectivity upper bound and various product inequalities for the equivariant sectional category. Applying them, we obtain some interesting results for equivariant and invariant parametrized topological complexity of a $G$-fibration.</description>

      <title>A categorification of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT with application to TQFTs and once-extended TQFTs derived from strict omega-groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first revisit the construction of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, which depends on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$. This constitutes a vast generalisation of the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT, with a trivial cocycle, and of Yetter's homotopy 2-type TQFT. We build our construction directly from homotopy theoretical techniques, and hence, as in Quinn's original notes from 1995, the construction works in all dimensions.
  Our aim in this is to provide background for giving in detail the construction of a once-extended TQFT categorifying Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, in the form of a symmetric monoidal bifunctor from the bicategory of manifolds, cobordisms and extended cobordisms, first to the symmetric monoidal bicategory of profunctors (enriched over vector spaces), and then to the Morita bicategory of algebras, bimodules and bimodule maps. These once-extended versions of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT likewise are defined for all dimensions, and, as with the original version, depend on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$.
  To show the utility of this approach, we explicitly compute both Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, and its extended version, for the case when $\boldsymbol{B}$ is the classifying space of a homotopy finite omega-groupoid, in this paper taking the form of a crossed complex, following Brown and Higgins.
  The constructions in this paper include, in particular, the description of once-extended TQFTs derived from the classifying space of a finite strict 2-group, of relevance for modelling discrete higher gauge theory, although the techniques involved are considerably more general.</description>

      <title>Interval Multiplicities of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any persistence module $M$ over a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, and any interval $I$ in $\mathbf{P}$, we give a formula of the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$ of the interval module $V_I$ in the indecomposable decomposition of $M$ in terms of the ranks of matrices consisting of structure linear maps of the module $M$, which gives a generalization of the corresponding formula for 1-dimensional persistence modules. This makes it possible to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. Moreover, the formula tells us which morphisms of $\mathbf{P}$ are essential to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some order-preserving map $\zeta \colon Z \to \mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \colon \operatorname{mod} \mathbf{P} \to \operatorname{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. In this case, we say that $\zeta$ essentially covers $I$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$, also known as a zigzag poset, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$.</description>

      <title>Some topological genera and Jacobi forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and elucidate the $\widehat{A}$-genus, Hirzebruch's $L$-genus and Witten's $W$-genus, cobordism invariants of special classes of manifolds. After slight modification, involving Hecke's trick, we find that the $\widehat{A}$-genus and $L$-genus arise directly from Jacobi's theta function. For every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series \[ \widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau), \] which are easily converted to the original topological expressions. Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds. In addition, we show that the nonholomorphic $G_2^{\star}$-completion of the characteristic series of the Witten genus is the Jacobi theta function avatar of the $\widehat{A}$-genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a nonarchimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>
