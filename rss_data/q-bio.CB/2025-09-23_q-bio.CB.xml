      <title>Cycling and tensed cells interpenetrated by non-cycling and compressed cells form a critical epithelial reticulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive mechanical proofreading toward faithful clonal selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.</description>
