      <title>Automated calculation of spin, isospin branching rules for su(4) irreps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open-source Python package, su4-branching, is introduced for the derivation of comprehensive spin S and isospin T branch- ing rules for any SU(4) irreducible representation.The Wigner supermultiplet scheme in nuclear and hadronic physics is based on SU(4) symmetry. However, the community does not have easy access to practical calculations of branching rules for any irreps.Our implementation combines group-theoretical methods with a notebook interface that is easy to use. This lets researchers look at large and complicated SU(4) irreps and check their work.The software produces tables, CSV files, and visual summaries, and it has been tested against both classic and modern reference results. This work enables group-structure investigations in nuclear modeling, particle physics, and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Challenges for first-principles nuclear structure: $^{11}$Li and $^{29}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations of atomic nuclei have had many successes in recent years. Nonetheless, important challenges that resist even brute-force calculation remain. As archetypal examples of these challenges, we consider $^{11}$Li and $^{29}$F, well known halo nuclides situated on islands of inversion. The deformed intruder levels, which are primarily two-particle, two-hole neutron excitations with respect to naive spherical shell model configurations, are slow, with respect to increases of the model space, to take their rightful place as the lowest levels; in fact the spherical and deformed configurations likely mix strongly. We suggest these systems prototype the challenges for other important intruder states, and can serve as useful testbeds for potential approaches.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in global optimizations of covariant energy density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent progress on global optimizations of covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs) and global calculations of binding energies within the covariant density functional theory (CDFT) has been analyzed and reviewed. Recently developed anchor-based optimization approach of Ref. [1] allows global optimizations of CEDFs at a reasonable numerical cost. Moreover, it permits such optimizations in a very large fermionic basis with a proper extrapolation to an infinite one. This allows to accurately estimate global calculation errors due to use of truncated fermionic basis and neglect of some contributions to binding energies (such as total electron binding energy)</description>

      <title>Search for dibaryon resonances in the reactions $dd\to dd\pi\pi$ and $pd \to pd\pi\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isoscalar dibaryon resonance $D_{03}(2380)$, discovered at WASA@COSY in the total cross section of the reaction $pn\to d\pi^0\pi^0$ and in the elastic pn scattering in the energy range corresponding to the invariant mass of the pn system of 2380 MeV, can reveal itself in the $pd\to pd\pi\pi$ and $dd\to dd\pi\pi$ reactions at higher energies due to deuteron excitation in the $t$ channel. In this paper, the cross sections of these reactions are estimated based on the model of the reaction $pn\to d\pi^0\pi^0$, proposed earlier by Platonova and Kukulin.</description>

      <title>Implication of multimessenger observations on the relativistic mean-field equation of state of dense nuclear matter and skin thickness of nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition and properties of infinite nuclear matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure remain incompletely understood. In this work, we constrain the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter - constructed within the framework of the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model - by combining results from chiral effective field theory and multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Using the saturation properties of nuclear matter, we generate a wide ensemble of EoS, which are subsequently constrained within a Bayesian framework. The resulting posterior distributions provide tight bounds on both the saturation parameters and the coupling constants of the RMF model. Our results indicate that the GW170817 event and the latest NICER observation favor a relatively soft EoS, leading to lower crust-core transition densities and thinner neutron star crusts. The radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star is tightly constrained to $12.508_{-0.241}^{+0.257}$ km, while the maximum mass reaches $2.174_{-0.123}^{+0.174}\,M_\odot$. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the $\omega$-$\rho$ coupling, which governs the density dependence of the symmetry energy, becomes increasingly significant under successive astrophysical constraints. Finally, the predicted neutron skin thickness of $^{48}$Ca agrees well with the CREX measurement, whereas that of $^{208}$Pb remains in tension with PREX-II. In contrast to earlier studies, we do not observe a clear correlation between the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb and the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$.</description>

      <title>High-order cumulants and correlation functions near the critical point from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition using molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our prior studies to third- and fourth-order cumulants in both coordinate- and momentum-space acceptances and integrated correlation functions (factorial cumulants). We find that, even near the critical point, non-Gaussian cumulants equilibrate on time scales comparable to those of the second-order cumulants, but show stronger finite-size effects. The presence of interactions and of the critical point leads to strong deviations of the cumulants from the ideal-gas baseline in coordinate space; these deviations are expected to persist in momentum space in the presence of collective expansion. In particular, the kurtosis becomes strongly negative, $\kappa \sigma^2 \ll -1$, on the crossover side of the critical point. However, this signal is significantly diluted once an efficiency cut used to distinguish protons from baryons is applied, leading to $|\kappa \sigma^2| \lesssim 1$ even in the presence of the critical point. We discuss our results in the context of ongoing measurements of proton number cumulants in heavy-ion collisions in RHIC-BES-II.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $2\nu$ECEC in $^{132}$Ba and revisited for $^{78}$Kr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of two-neutrino double electron capture ($2\nu$ECEC) in $^{132}$Ba and $^{78}$Kr based on large-scale shell-model calculations. The nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the $2\nu$ECEC process in $^{132}$Ba and $^{78}$Kr have been calculated using the SN100PN and GWBXG effective interactions, respectively. The reliability of these interactions is first assessed by reproducing the spectroscopic properties of the parent, intermediate, and granddaughter nuclei of the decay. Two different formulations are employed to estimate the half-lives. We also examine the cumulative contribution of $1^+$ and $0^+$ states in the intermediate nuclei to the NMEs associated with the Gamow-Teller (GT) and Fermi transitions, respectively. Our results provide an improved prediction of the NME and half-life for $2\nu$ECEC in $^{78}$Kr compared to previous studies and offer a precise theoretical benchmark for future experimental investigations in $^{132}$Ba.</description>

      <title>Proton emission systematics along proton drip line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the chart containing both spontaneous and beta-delayed proton emission processes in terms of the Coulomb parameter, reduced radius and angular momentum ($\chi$, $\rho$, $l$). We then compare the methods to estimate decay width $\Gamma$ of a resonant state in a proton mean field, namely the continuity equation for outgoing Gamow states, phase shift analysis of real scattering states and numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation in the complex plane. We show that they provide similar results in the region where it is possible to evaluate the imaginary part of the energy for a resonant (Gamow) state. We then investigate the role of the centrifugal barrier induced by Coulomb interaction and also by proton single particle orbitals. We show that the so-called universal decay law, connecting the logarithm of the monopole reduced width to the fragmentation potential, remains also valid for beta-delayed proton emission processes. This fact allows us to describe experimental data for all proton emission processes in terms of a linear dependence connecting the logarithm of the monopole Coulomb-reduced decay width to the logarithm of the monopole Coulomb penetrability and fragmentation potential within a factor of three for absolute values.</description>

      <title>Systematics of the chemical freeze-out line in the high baryon density regime explored at SIS100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic uncertainties of chemical freeze-out fits at SIS100 energies (Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3-5$ GeV) are studied using UrQMD simulations. Although hadron production in UrQMD does not occur on a sharp chemical freeze-out hyper-surface, the extracted fit quality is shown to be very good. The extracted chemical parameters depend on the selected hadron species as well as the underlying equation of state (EoS) of the matter. Including light nuclei and anti-protons in the fit increases the expected freeze-out temperature, while a stiffer EoS increases the obtained chemical potential. Similarly, the baryon densities extracted by the thermal fits depend on the choice of hadrons as well as the underlying equation of state. These results are important for the upcoming CBM@FAIR physics program and highlight that a degree of caution is advised when one relates the chemical freeze-out curve to features on the QCD phase diagram like the critical endpoint or a possible phase transition</description>

      <title>Systematic study of scalar, vector, and mixed density dependencies in relativistic mean-field descriptions of hyperonic matter in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equation of state (EOS) of hyperonic neutron star (NS) matter within a density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) framework. The effects of scalar, vector, and mixed density dependencies in meson-baryon couplings are systematically examined along with alternative forms of the $\rho$-meson coupling. Several meson-nucleon parameter sets are explored here for the first time for neutron stars and compared with the standard DD2 EOS. Most new parameterizations produce stiffer EOSs, leading to neutron stars with larger radii and higher tidal deformabilities. However, the inclusion of $\Lambda$ hyperons softens these EOSs, and the resulting maximum masses still satisfy the two solar mass limits and agree with NICER measurements. These results highlight the importance of exploring alternative density dependencies in constraining dense matter through multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of upbend resonance and validity of Brink-Axel hypothesis in the low-energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of low-energy enhancement in the radiative strength function (RSF), which is known as the upbend resonance (UBR) and has a crucial role in the description of neutron-captured cross section and stellar nucleosynthesis, is still under debate. The present letter extends the exact thermal pairing plus phonon damping model to explore the microscopic nature of the UBR and its thermodynamic origin over a wide mass range of odd-odd, odd-A, and even-even systems, from $^{44}$Sc to $^{153}$Sm, whose experimental RSFs, including the UBRs, are available. The results of our calculations indicate that the UBR originates from non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole excitations with a strength three times stronger than that of the giant dipole resonance. Moreover, our results reveal that the UBR, which emerges only at finite temperatures within the present framework, invalidates the Brink-Axel hypothesis in the very low $E_\gamma$ region. Last but not least, a global relation between the integrated strength of the RSF in the UBR region to that of the total RSF and the mass number is reported, for the first time, within the present study.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Emulation of Proton-Deuteron Scattering via the Reduced Basis Method and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce highly accurate and efficient emulators for proton-deuteron scattering below the deuteron breakup threshold. We explore two different reduced-basis method strategies: one based on the Kohn variational principle and another on Galerkin projections of the underlying system of linear equations. We use the adaptive greedy algorithm previously developed for two-body scattering for optimal selection of high-fidelity training points in the input parameter space. We demonstrate that these emulators reproduce ab initio hyperspherical harmonics calculations of $R$-matrix elements with remarkable precision, achieving relative errors as low as $10^{-7}$ with a small number of training points, even in regions of strong nonlinear parameter dependence. They also dramatically accelerate the exploration of the scattering predictions in the parameter space, a capability highly desired for calibrating (chiral) three-nucleon forces against scattering measurements. Our formalism can be further generalized to handle nucleon-deuteron scattering above the breakup threshold. These emulator developments will provide valuable tools to accelerate uncertainty quantification and rigorous parameter inference in the study of nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-term effects on isospin asymmetric hot and dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02697v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the CP-violating $\theta$ term on isospin symmetry breaking in quark matter and compact star properties using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. By incorporating the $\theta$ parameter through the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction, we derive the thermodynamic potential and gap equations under finite temperature, baryon chemical potential, and isospin chemical potential. At zero temperature and baryon density, $\theta$ suppresses conventional chiral ($\sigma$) and pion ($\pi$) condensates while promoting pseudo-scalar ($\eta$) and scalar-isovector ($\delta$) condensates, thereby reducing the critical isospin chemical potential $\mu_I^{\text{crit}}$ for spontaneous symmetry breaking. For $\theta=\pi$, a first-order phase transition emerges at $\mu_I^{\text{crit}} = 0.021$ GeV, accompanied by CP symmetry restoration. Extending the investigation to finite temperature and baryon chemical potential reveals that these $\theta$-term-induced effects persist. Axion effects (modeled via $\theta\equiv a/f_a$) stiffen the equation of state (EOS) of non-strange quark stars, increasing their maximum mass and radii, in agreement with multimessenger constraints from pulsar observations and gravitational wave events. These results establish $\theta$ as a critical parameter modulating both the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure and compact star observables.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators from Partons to Hadrons: Unveiling the Dynamics of the Strong Interactions with Archival ALEPH Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a remarkably rich theory exhibiting numerous emergent degrees of freedom, from flux tubes to hadrons. Their description in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons of the QCD Lagrangian remains a central challenge of modern physics. Colliders offer a unique opportunity to probe these phenomena experimentally: high energy partons produced from the QCD vacuum excite these emergent degrees, imprinting their dynamics in correlations in asymptotic energy flux. Decoding these correlations requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, beyond that achieved in previous measurements. Recent progress has enabled precision calculations of energy flux on charged particles alone, allowing data-theory comparisons for measurements using high resolution tracking detectors. In this Letter, we resurrect thirty-year-old data from the ALEPH tracker, and perform a high angular resolution measurement of the two-point correlation of energy flux, probing QCD over three orders of magnitude in scale in a single measurement. Our measurement unveils for the first time the full spectrum of the correlator, including light-ray quasi-particle states, flux-tube excitations, and their transitions into confined hadrons. We compare our measurement with record precision theoretical predictions, achieving percent level agreement, and revealing interesting new phenomena in the confinement transitions. More broadly, we highlight the immense potential of this newly unlocked archival data set, the so called "recycling frontier", and emphasize synergies with ongoing and future collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Empirical Reconstruction of the JSNS$^2$ KDAR $\nu_\mu$-$^{12}$C Missing-Energy Spectrum with a Two-Ex-Gaussian and Generalized-Tail Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses of the JSNS$^2$ monoenergetic $\nu_\mu$ scattering on $^{12}$C at 235.5~MeV have compared the measured missing-energy spectrum with several nuclear models, including \textsc{NuWro}, \textsc{GiBUU}, and RMF+Achilles. While these models reproduce the overall peak position, their respective $\chi^2$ values of $35.5$, $176.8$, and $58.1$ indicate that none can simultaneously describe the spectral width and the high-energy tail, reflecting limitations in the treatment of binding energy, two-particle--two-hole (2p--2h) excitations, and final-state interactions (FSI). To address these discrepancies, we introduce an empirical yet physically motivated representation of the spectrum based on two exponentially modified Gaussian (ex-Gaussian) components for p- and s-shell knockout and a generalized power--exponential continuum term describing multinucleon and FSI-induced strength. The fit reproduces the JSNS$^2$ data within the fitted energy range with $\chi^2=8.0$ for 6 degrees of freedom. yielding parameters that quantify asymmetric broadening of the s-shell while preserving a narrow quasielastic p-shell response. This compact model demonstrates that a minimal empirical framework can capture key features of the nuclear response and provides a useful reference for phenomenological comparisons and future studies of quasielastic and 2p--2h dynamics in the few-hundred-MeV regime.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shifts of $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our predictions for the Lorentz scalar mass shifts of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The in-medium mass shifts are estimated by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies of the mesons based on a flavor-SU(5) effective Lagrangian approach. In-medium properties necessary for the estimates are calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The enhanced self-energies of the mesons in symmetric nuclear matter relative to those in free space, yield the negative mass shifts of these mesons.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional sizes and shapes of pion emission in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision measurements in high-energy heavy-ion physics, there is an increasing expectation towards phenomenological and theoretical studies to provide a better description of data. In recent years, multiple experiments have confirmed through two-pion Bose-Einstein correlation measurements that the shape of the two-pion pair source can be well described by Levy-stable distributions. However, direct comparisons of new phenomenological results with the data are still needed to understand the underlying phenomena and learn more about the nature of pion emission. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional analysis of the two-pion source in Monte-Carlo simulations of Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon collision energy, and discuss a detailed comparison with the most recent centrality-dependent measurements from the PHENIX Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (4DEGB). We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations-of-state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration, which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, $\alpha$, within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of the constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties. We find that positive values of $\alpha$ support massive stars consistent with the 2\,$M_{\odot}$ constraint and NICER measurements, while negative values, although compatible with low-mass radius observations, fail to reach the observed maximum mass, particularly for EoSs involving phase transitions. Therefore, astrophysical observations may be used to effectively constrain the allowed range of $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative predictions of alpha-charmonium correlation functions in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-body $ ^{4}\textrm{He}\left(\alpha\right)$-charmonium $ \left(c\bar{c}\right) $ potentials in the single-folding potential (SFP) approach are built by using a first principles HAL QCD low-energy $ NJ/\psi$ and $ N\eta_{c} $ interactions. The $N\textrm{-}c\bar{c}$ potentials are observed to exhibit an attractive nature across all distances, accompanied by a characteristic long-range tail. It is found that the $ \alpha\textrm{-}J/\psi $ system appears to be loosely bound with the central binding energy in the range of 0.1-0.6 MeV, while for spin-$ 1/2 $ $\alpha\textrm{-}\eta_{c}$, no bound or resonance state (with respect to the $ \alpha \textrm{-} c\bar{c} $ threshold) was found. The $ \alpha\textrm{-}c\bar{c} $ correlation function in high-energy collisions is examined to explore the $ N\textrm{-}c\bar{c} $ interaction. The analysis revealed that variations in spin-dependent $\alpha\textrm{-}c\bar{c}$ interactions- spin-$3/2$ $\alpha\textrm{-}J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $\alpha\textrm{-}J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $\alpha\textrm{-}\eta_c$, and the spin-averaged $\alpha\textrm{-}J/\psi$-produce noticeable differences in the $\alpha\textrm{-}c\bar{c}$ correlation function, especially when the source size is around $ 3 $ fm. It is found that different results are produced by the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formula at small source sizes. This indicates that a relatively long-range interaction exists for the $ \alpha\textrm{-}c\bar{c} $ system. Furthermore, a comparison has been conducted between two density functions of $ ^{4}\textrm{He}$ the central depression (CD) and the simple single Gaussian (SG) density-both of which share an identical rms radius of 1.56 fm. Although the $\alpha\textrm{-}J/\psi$ binding energies for the two models are nearly indistinguishable, their corresponding correlation functions demonstrate markedly different behaviors.</description>

      <title>Light and heavy $\Lambda$ hyperclusters in nuclear matter with relativistic-mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of relativistic-mean-field (RMF) models, we investigate the properties of light and heavy $\Lambda$ hyperclusters emersed in nuclear matter at various densities $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ and proton fractions $Y_p$. In particular, the (hyper)clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear matter take constant densities and is treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation. The binding energies of (hyper)clusters decrease with the density of nuclear matter $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$, which eventually become unbound and melt in the presence of nuclear medium, i.e., Mott transition. For light clusters with proton numbers $N_p &lt; 4$, with the addition of $\Lambda$ hyperons, the binding energies per baryon for $\Lambda$ hyperclusters become smaller and decrease faster with $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ due to the weaker $N$-$\Lambda$ attraction. For heavy clusters with $N_p \geq 4$, on the contrary, the addition of $\Lambda$ hyperons increases the stability of (hyper)clusters so that the Mott transition density becomes larger as nucleons occupying higher energy states while $\Lambda$ hyperons remain in the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital. The isovector effects on (hyper)clusters in nuclear medium are also identified, where the binding energies for (hyper)clusters with $N_p&gt; N_n$ ($N_p&lt; N_n$) increase (decrease) with $Y_p$. For those predicted by nonlinear relativistic density functionals, light (hyper)clusters are destabilized drastically as $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ increases, while the binding energies of heavier (hyper)clusters vary smoothly with $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$. The binding energy shifts of various (hyper)clusters due to the impact of nuclear medium are fitted to an analytical formula, which could be employed to examine the evolutions of (hyper)clusters in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous improvements of nuclear mass and charge radius predictions using multi-task Gaussian process approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-task Gaussian process (GP) machine learning model is introduced to simultaneously predict two important nuclear observables across the nuclear chart, namely nuclear masses and charge radii. Utilizing 12 physical input features, our multi-task GP consistently outperforms single-task learning, achieving overall root-mean-square deviations of 0.136 MeV for masses and 0.007 fm for charge radii. The good performance of the present model is confirmed by three complementary validations, namely various fractions for training and testing data, further extrapolations for newly reported nuclei far from stability, and popular Garvey-Kelson mass relations. The correlations between the two observables are explicitly analyzed within the multi-task learning framework. Furthermore, by employing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, we interpret the importance of different features for mass and radius predictions across distinct nuclear regions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task GP approach for high-accuracy nuclear property predictions.</description>

Abstract: We determine the average state and the uncorrelated modes that characterize the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial state in two typical centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. We find that modes in a narrow central bin are similar to those in events at fixed vanishing impact parameter, while those in a mid-peripheral centrality class are affected by the impact-parameter variation. We study how each fluctuation mode affects observables both in the initial state and in the final state of the collisions, at the end of a state-of-the-art boost-invariant hybrid evolution with KoMPoST + MUSIC + iSS + SMASH, and show that implementing a hadronic transport cascade in such a mode-by-mode analysis with reasonable statistical noise is costly but feasible.</description>

      <title>Global optimization of harmonic oscillator basis in covariant density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present investigation focuses on the improvement of the accuracy of the description of binding energies within moderately sized fermionic basis. Using the solutions corresponding to infinite fermionic basis it was shown that in the case of meson exchange (ME) covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs) the global accuracy of the description of binding energies in the finite $N_F=16-20$ bases can be drastically (by a factor ranging from $\approx 3$ up to $\approx 9$ dependent on the functional and $N_F$) improved by a global optimization of oscillator frequency of the basis. This is a consequence of the unique feature of the ME functionals in which with increasing fermionic basis size fermionic and mesonic energies approach the exact (infinite basis) solution from above and below, respectively. As a consequence, an optimal oscillator frequency $\hbar\omega_0$ of the basis can be defined which provides an accurate reproduction of exact total binding energies by the ones calculated in truncated basis. This leads to a very high accuracy of the calculations in moderately sized $N_F=20$ basis when mass dependent oscillator frequency is used: global rms differences $\delta B_{rms}$ between the binding energies calculated in infinite and truncated bases are only 0.025 MeV and 0.031 MeV for the NL5(Z) and DD-MEZ functionals, respectively. Optimized values of the oscillator frequency $\hbar\omega_0$ are provided for three major classes of CEDFs, i.e. for density dependent meson exchange functionals, nonlinear meson exchange ones and point coupling functionals.</description>

      <title>Collective effects in O-O and Ne-Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV from a hybrid approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many features of heavy-ion collisions are well described by hybrid approaches, where the droplet of strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is modeled by hydrodynamics and the subsequent dilute stage is performed with a hadronic transport model. Conventionally, the formation of a QGP is well established in larger collision systems like Lead and Gold. However, hints of collectivity were found even in proton-proton collisions, raising the question where the onset of QGP formation lays. This study aims at making predictions for the light ions run at the LHC in July 2025, in order to explore the applicability of hybrid approaches in smaller collision systems. We employ three different models, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid, the pure hadronic cascade of SMASH and Angantyr to simulate O-O collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV. This setup allows us to compare evolutions with and without a hydrodynamic description on an equal basis, while Angantyr serves as a baseline for no collective effects.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, mergers of binary neutron stars and formation of stellar black holes, which employed standard Skyrme interactions, established clear correlations between the evolution of these processes, characteristics of the hot compact objects, as well as neutrino and gravitational wave signals, and the value of effective nucleon mass at the saturation density. Unfortunately, the density dependence of the effective mass of nucleons in these models does not align with the predictions of ab initio models with three body forces. In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts. Moreover, the higher the temperature, the lower the maximum mass that the hot star can support.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Magnetic effects on Bulk Viscosity in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in a background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to incorporate the collisional broadening (``modified Urca'') contribution. We use the recently developed Nucleon Width Approximation, which naturally includes the magnetic field dependence of all contributions. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</description>

      <title>$\pi$- and $K$-Mesons Properties for Large $N_f$</title>

Abstract: The restoration of dynamical chiral symmetry for a higher number of light-quark flavors $N_f$ implies suppression of the dynamically generated quark mass. The study of various larger values of $N_f$ may have a greater impact on the internal structure of light hadrons. In this work, we study the properties of the $\pi$- (pion) and $K$-meson (kaon), such as the mass, condensate, and leptonic decay constant, for various $N_f$. We use the symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dependent contact interaction model of quark. The dynamical quark masses are calculated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). The masses of pion ($m_{\pi}$) and kaon ($m_{K}$) for different values of $N_f$ and are determined using the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. For fixed $N_c=3$ and $N_f$ is increased, the dynamically generated quark mass $M_{u/d}$ ( mass of up and down quarks), strange quark mass ($M_s$), meson in-condensate $\kappa^{1/3}_{(\pi,K)}$, and decay constant $f_{(\pi, K)}$. monotonically decrease as a function of $N_f$, except for the pion and kaon mass $m_{(\pi, K)}$, which increase above a critical value of $N_f$ around $8$. This is the region where chiral symmetry is restored and the pion and kaon behave as free particles, similar to thier behavior in the the presence of a heat bath. The results obtained for fixed $N_f=2$ and $N_c=3$ are fairly in decent agreement with experimentally calculated statistics and previous model calculations based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).</description>

      <title>Proton spin from small-$x$ with constraints from the valence quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the valence quark model recently calculated for polarized proton to constrain the non-perturbative initial condition for the small-$x$ helicity evolution. The remaining free parameters are constrained by performing a global analysis to the available polarized small-$x$ deep inelastic scattering data. A good description of the world data is obtained with only 8 free parameters. The model parameters are tightly constrained by the data, allowing us to predict the proton polarized structure function $g_1^p$ to be negative at small $x$. Furthermore, we obtain the small-$x$ quark and gluon spins to give a contribution $\int_{10^{-5}}^{0.1} dx \left( \frac{1}{2}\Delta\Sigma + \Delta G \right) = 0.76 \pm 0.13$ or $1.70\pm 0.20$ to the proton spin, depending on the applied running coupling prescription.</description>

      <title>Transversity Generalized Parton Distributions of $\Delta$ with the Diquark Spectator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show quark transversity generalized parton pistributions (GPDs) of $\Delta^+$ isobar by using the diquark spectator model for the first time. First, this model is tested by electric charge, magnetic-dipole and axial charge form factors, and it is used for calculating the transversity GPDs $H^{qT}_{1,3,5,7}$ of $\Delta^+$. The quark transversity distribution $h_1$ is then obtained from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit. Then, helicity-flip amplitudes are shown numerically by using relations between the helicity amplitudes and the GPDs. Finally, by taking first moments of the GPDs, tensor form factors are obtained and we predict the tensor charge. Experimentally, $N$-$\Delta$ transition GPDs are investigated in deeply virtual Compton scattering and virtual meson-production processes, and generalized distribution amplitudes, which correspond to the $s$-channel GPDs, could be investigated by the two-photon processes $\gamma^* \gamma \to \Delta \bar\Delta$ at the electron-positron colliders. Therefore, the spin-3/2 $\Delta$ GPDs could become interesting quantities experimentally in future.</description>

      <title>Particle momentum spectra, correlations, and maximum entropy principle in high-multiplicity collision events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis can be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

      <title>Coherent elastic scattering of low energy photons by neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Compton process with the initial states of photons and neutrons described by the density matrices of a general form is studied for low energies of photons. The coherent contribution to the inclusive probability to record a photon is investigated in detail. This contribution gives the hologram of the neutron one-particle density matrix. The evolution of the Stokes parameters of scattered photons is described. The susceptibility tensor of a neutron gas and a wave packet of a single neutron is obtained. The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of free neutrons is derived. It turns out that this polarization operator possesses pole singularities in the short wavelength approximation. These singularities corresponding to the additional degrees of freedom are identified with plasmons and the respective plasmon-polaritons are described. There are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes in a neutron gas and on a single neutron wave packet. Some plasmon-polariton modes prove to be tachyonic and unstable manifesting a spontaneous generation of the magnetic field. The estimates of the parameters of the neutron gas when it becomes ferromagnetic are found. In the infrared limit, the neutron wave packet behaves in coherent Compton scattering as a point particle with dynamical magnetic moment, the additional degrees of freedom being reduced to the dynamical part of the magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks on the light front, and their mixture with baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous papers we developed the light front formulation for Hamiltonians and wave functions (WFs) for mesons and baryons, with both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. For baryons limited to the lowest Fock component with three quarks, the longitudinal WF is valued in an equilateral triangle with momentum fractions $x_i,i=1,2,3$. The WF was developed both numerically and using a basis function that diagonalizes the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper we extend this analysis to $n$ quark states, and specialize to pentaquarks ($n=5$). We determine their masses and WFs, and address the mixing between baryons and pentaquarks, the issue central to understanding the observed antiquark sea of baryons.</description>
