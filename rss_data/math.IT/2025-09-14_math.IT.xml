      <title>Several new classes of optimal p-ary cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic codes, as a crucial subclass of linear codes, exhibit broad applications in communication systems, data storage systems, and consumer electronics, primarily attributed to their well-structured algebraic properties. Let $p$ denote an odd prime with $p\geq5$, and let $m$ be a positive integer. The primary objective of this paper is to construct three novel classes of optimal $p$-ary cyclic codes, denoted as ${\mathcal{C}_p}(0,s,t)$, which possess the parameters $[{p^m} - 1,{p^m} - 2m - 2,4]$. Here, $s$ is defined as $s = \frac{{{p^m}+1}}{{2}}$, and $t$ satisfies the condition $2 \le t \le {p^m} - 2$. Notably, one of the constructed classes includes certain known optimal quinary cyclic codes as special cases. Furthermore, for the specific case when $p=5$, this paper additionally presents four new classes of optimal cyclic codes ${\mathcal{C}_5}(0,s,t)$.</description>

      <title>Semantic Rate-Distortion Theory with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era for communication. As a result, the establishment of a semantic communication framework is putting on the agenda. Based on a realistic semantic communication model, this paper develops a rate-distortion framework for semantic compression. Different from the existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic meaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we exploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to effectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in an AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in rate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the minimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional symbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic scenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic probability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission accuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and AI, enabling potential applications in bandwidth-efficient semantic-aware networks, enhanced transceiver understanding, and optimized semantic transmission for AI-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Analog Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Interference-Based Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider analog over-the-air federated learning, where devices harvest energy from in-band and out-band radio frequency signals, with the former also causing co-channel interference (CCI). To mitigate the aggregation error, we propose an effective denoising policy that does not require channel state information (CSI). We also propose an adaptive scheduling algorithm that dynamically adjusts the number of local training epochs based on available energy, enhancing device participation and learning performance while reducing energy consumption. Simulation results and convergence analysis confirm the robust performance of the algorithm compared to conventional methods. It is shown that the performance of the proposed denoising method is comparable to that of conventional CSI-based methods. It is observed that high-power CCI severely degrades the learning performance, which can be mitigated by increasing the number of active devices, achievable via the adaptive algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Base Station Assignment and Resource Allocation for 6G ISAC Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G networks, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) will be able to provide a performance boost in both perception and wireless connectivity. This paper considers a multiple base station (BS) architecture to support the comprehensive services of data transmission and multi-target sensing. In this context, a cooperative BS assignment and resource allocation (CBARA) strategy is proposed in this paper, aiming at jointly optimizing the communication and sensing (C&amp;S) performance. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound and the achievable rate with respect to transmit power and bandwidth are derived and utilized as optimization criteria for the CBARA scheme. We develop a heuristic alternating optimization algorithm to obtain an effective sub-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem caused by multiple coupled variables. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which achieves a performance improvement of 117% in communication rate and 40% in sensing accuracy, compared to the classic scheme.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Robust Anti-jamming Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could enhance anti-jamming communication performance by dynamically configuring channel conditions and establishing reliable air-ground links. However, large-scale ARIS faces critical deployment challenges due to the prohibitive computational complexity of conventional discrete optimization methods and sophisticated jamming threats. In this paper, we introduce a mean field modeling approach to design the spatial configuration of ARIS by a continuous density function, thus bypassing high-dimensional combinatorial optimization. We consider an adaptive jammer which adjusts its position and beamforming to minimize the sum-rate. A key finding reveals that the jammer's optimal strategy is governed by a proximity-directivity trade-off between reducing path loss and enhancing spatial focusing. To combat the jamming, we propose a robust anti-jamming transmission framework that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, the ARIS reflection, and the ARIS spatial distribution to maximize the worst-case sum-rate. By leveraging variational optimization and Riemannian manifold methods, we efficiently solve the functional optimization problems. Our analysis further unveils that the optimal ARIS deployment follows a spatial water-filling principle, concentrating resources in high-gain regions while avoiding interference-prone areas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the sum-rate. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of UAVs, validating its effectiveness for scalable ARIS-assisted anti-jamming communications.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency for Massive MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the energy efficiency (EE) of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) techniques to leverage spatial beamforming gains for both communication and sensing. We focus on an mMIMO-ISAC system operating in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing setting with a uniform planar array, zero-forcing downlink transmission, and mono-static radar sensing to exploit multi-carrier channel diversity. By deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communication rate and Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs), we are able to determine the overall EE in closed-form. A power allocation problem is then formulated to maximize the system's EE by balancing communication and sensing efficiency while satisfying communication rate requirements and CRB constraints. Through a detailed analysis of CRB properties, we reformulate the problem into a more manageable form and leverage Dinkelbach's and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to develop an efficient iterative algorithm. A novel initialization strategy is also proposed to ensure high-quality feasible starting points for the iterative optimization process. Extensive simulations demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed approach over baseline approaches. Results further reveal that as communication spectral efficiency rises, the influence of sensing EE on the overall system EE becomes more pronounced, even in sensing-dominated scenarios. Specifically, in the high $\omega$ regime of $2 \times 10^{-3}$, we observe a 16.7\% reduction in overall EE when spectral efficiency increases from $4$ to $8$ bps/Hz, despite the system being sensing-dominated.</description>

      <title>Locally Permuted Low Rank Column-wise Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We precisely formulate, and provide a solution for, the Low Rank Columnwise Sensing (LRCS) problem when some of the observed data is scrambled/permuted/unlabeled. This problem, which we refer to as permuted LRCS, lies at the intersection of two distinct topics of recent research: unlabeled sensing and low rank column-wise (matrix) sensing. We introduce a novel generalization of the recently developed Alternating Gradient Descent and Minimization (AltGDMin) algorithm to solve this problem. We also develop an alternating minimization (AltMin) solution. We show, using simulation experiments, that both converge but PermutedAltGDmin is much faster than Permuted-AltMin.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving and Energy-Aware Resource Management in 6G Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility, and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G edge networks.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Lattices and GKP Codes -- Simple Randomized Constructions from Cryptographic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct good GKP (Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill) codes (in the sense of Conrad, Eisert and Seifert proposed) from standard short integer solution lattices (SIS) as well as from ring SIS and module SIS lattices, R-SIS and M-SIS lattices, respectively. These lattice are crucial for lattice-based cryptography. Our construction yields GKP codes with distance $\sqrt{n/\pi e}$. This compares favorably with the NTRU-based construction by Conrad et al. that achieves distance $\Omega(\sqrt{n/q}),$ with $n\le q^2/0.28$. Unlike their codes, our codes do not have secret keys that can be used to speed-up the decoding. However, we present a simple decoding algorithm that, for many parameter choices, experimentally yields decoding results similar to the ones for NTRU-based codes. Using the R-SIS and M-SIS construction, our simple decoding algorithm runs in nearly linear time. Following Conrad, Eisert and Seifert's work, our construction of GKP codes follows directly from an explicit, randomized construction of symplectic lattices with (up to constants $\approx 1$) minimal distance $(1/\sigma_{2n})^{1/2n}\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi e}}$, where $\sigma_{2n}$ is the volume of the 2n-dimensional unit ball. Before this result, Buser and Sarnak gave a non-constructive proof for the existence of such symplectic lattices.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and provide a nearly optimal recovery bound for it. We prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O(\log n \cdot \|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m)$, and further show that there exists a noise vector for which the error lower bound exceeds $O\bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}} \cdot \frac{\|\mathbf{w}\|_2}{\sqrt m}\bigr)$. Here, $n$ is the dimension of the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb R^m$ with sub-Gaussian norm $\sigma$, we establish a bound of order $O\bigl(\sigma \sqrt{\frac{n \log^4 n}{m}}\bigr)$, and also provide a corresponding minimax lower bound. Our results affirm Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic factors, providing a new insight into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. Applied to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG achieves impressive predictive accuracy close to full supervision using less than 10% of the labels. It consistently outperforms standard baselines across metrics and batch sizes, collecting more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits.
  We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding for Gaussian Channels with Mean and Variance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channel coding for Gaussian channels with the recently introduced mean and variance cost constraints. Through matching converse and achievability bounds, we characterize the optimal first- and second-order performance. The main technical contribution of this paper is an achievability scheme which uses random codewords drawn from a mixture of three uniform distributions on $(n-1)$-spheres of radii $R_1, R_2$ and $R_3$, where $R_i = O(\sqrt{n})$ and $|R_i - R_j| = O(1)$. To analyze such a mixture distribution, we prove a lemma giving a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q_j^{cc}$, where $Q_i^{cc}$ is induced by a random channel input uniformly distributed on an $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $R_i$. To facilitate the application of the usual central limit theorem, we also give a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q^*_i$, where $Q_i^*$ is induced by a random channel input with i.i.d. components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a class of divergences measuring the difference between probability density functions on a one-dimensional sample space. This divergence is a one-parameter variation of the {Itakura--Saito} divergence between quantile density functions. We prove that the proposed divergence is one-parameter variation of transport Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hessian distance of negative Boltzmann entropy with respect to Wasserstein-2 metric. From Taylor expansions, we also formulate the $3$-symmetric tensor in Wasserstein space, which is given by an iterative Gamma three operators. The alpha-geodesic on Wasserstein space is also derived. From these properties, we name the proposed information measures transport alpha divergences. We provide several examples of transport alpha divergences for generative models in machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic un-equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.</description>
