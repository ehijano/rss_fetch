      <title>Low complexity binary words avoiding $(5/2)^+$-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rote words are infinite words that contain $2n$ factors of length $n$ for every $n \geq 1$. Shallit and Shur, as well as Ollinger and Shallit, showed that there are Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers and that this is best possible. In this note we give a structure theorem for the Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers, confirming a conjecture of Ollinger and Shallit.</description>

      <title>Rational Exponents for General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational number $r$ is a \textbf{realizable exponent} for a graph $H$ if there exists a finite family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})=\Theta(n^r)$, where $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ that an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph can have. Results for realizable exponents are currently known only when $H$ is either a star or a clique, with the full resolution of the $H=K_2$ case being a major breakthrough of Bukh and Conlon.
  In this paper, we establish the first set of results for realizable exponents which hold for arbitrary graphs $H$ by showing that for any graph $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta \ge 1$, every rational in the interval $\left[v(H)-\frac{e(H)}{2\Delta^2},\ v(H)\right]$ is realizable for $H$. We also prove a ``stability'' result for generalized Tur\'an numbers of trees which implies that if $T\ne K_2$ is a tree with $\ell$ leaves, then $T$ has no realizable exponents in $[0,\ell]\setminus \mathbb{Z}$. Our proof of this latter result uses a new variant of the classical Helly theorem for trees, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Gy\'arf\'as' Path-Colour Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their 1997 paper titled ``Fruit Salad", Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s posed the following conjecture: there exists a constant $k$ such that if each path of a graph spans a $3$-colourable subgraph, then the graph is $k$-colourable. It is noted that $k=4$ might suffice. Let $r(G)$ be the maximum chromatic number of any subgraph $H$ of $G$ where $H$ is spanned by a path. The only progress on this conjecture comes from Randerath and Schiermeyer in 2002, who proved that if $G$ is an $n$ vertex graph, then $\chi(G) \leq r(G)\log_{\frac{8}{7}}(n)$.
  We prove that for all natural numbers $r$, there exists a graph $G$ with $r(G)\leq r$ and $\chi(G)\geq \lfloor\frac{3r}{2}\rfloor -1$. Hence, for all constants $k$ there exists a graph with $\chi - r &gt; k$. Our proof is constructive.
  We also study this problem in graphs with a forbidden induced subgraph. We show that if $G$ is $K_{1,t}$-free, for $t\geq 4$, then $\chi(G) \leq (t-1)(r(G)+\binom{t-1}{2}-3)$. If $G$ is claw-free, then we prove $\chi(G) \leq 2r(G)$. Additionally, the graphs $G$ where every induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$ satisfy $\chi(G') = r(G')$ are considered. We call such graphs path-perfect, as this class generalizes perfect graphs. We prove that if $H$ is a forest with at most $4$ vertices other than the claw, then every $H$-free graph $G$ has $\chi(G) \leq r(G)+1$. We also prove that if $H$ is additionally not isomorphic to $2K_2$ or $K_2+2K_1$, then all $H$-free graphs are path-perfect.</description>

      <title>Solution to a problem on isolation of $3$-vertex paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-path isolation number of a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,P_3)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects each $3$-vertex path of $G$, meaning that no two edges of $G-N[D]$ intersect. Zhang and Wu proved that $\iota(G,P_3) \leq 2n/7$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $6$-cycle. The bound is attained by infinitely many graphs having induced $6$-cycles. Huang, Zhang and Jin proved that if $G$ has no $6$-cycles, or $G$ has no induced $5$-cycles and no induced $6$-cycles, then $\iota(G, P_3) \leq n/4$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $7$-cycle or an $11$-cycle. They asked if the bound still holds asymptotically for connected graphs having no induced $6$-cycles. More precisely, taking $f(n)$ to be the maximum value of $\iota(G,P_3)$ over all connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ having no induced $6$-cycles, their question is whether $\limsup_{n \to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{n} = \frac{1}{4}$. We verify this by proving that $f(n) = \left \lfloor (n+1)/4 \right \rfloor$. The proof hinges on further proving that if $G$ is such a graph and $\iota(G, P_3) = (n+1)/4$, then $\iota(G-v, P_3) &lt; \iota(G, P_3)$ for each vertex $v$ of $G$. This new idea promises to be of further use. We also prove that if the maximum degree of such a graph $G$ is at least $5$, then $\iota(G,P_3) \leq n/4$.</description>

      <title>Finding congruences with the WZ method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the Wilf-Zeilberger (WZ) method to establish congruences related to truncated Ramanujan-type series. By constructing hypergeometric terms $f(k, a, b, \ldots)$ with Gosper-summable differences and selecting appropriate parameters, we derive several congruences modulo $p$ and $p^2$ for primes $p &gt; 2$. For instance, we prove that for any prime $p &gt; 2$, \[ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1} \frac{10n+3}{2^{3n}}\binom{3n}{n}\binom{2n}{n}^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{p},\] and \[ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1} \frac{(-1)^n(20n^2+8n+1)}{2^{12n}}\binom{2n}{n}^5 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}. \] These results partially confirm conjectures by Sun and provide some novel congruences.</description>

      <title>Inequalities related to the coefficients of the $j$-function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the log-concavity or log-convexity of combinatorial sequences and their root sequences, higher order Tur{\'a}n inequalities, and Laguerre inequalities of order two have been widely studied. However, the research of the Fourier coefficient $c(n)$ of the $j$-function is limited to its asymptotic form. In this paper, we give the appropriate upper and lower bounds of $c(n)$ to establish the inequalities associated with it.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Four Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The translational tiling problem, dated back to Wang's domino problem in the 1960s, is one of the most representative undecidable problems in the field of discrete geometry and combinatorics. Ollinger initiated the study of the undecidability of translational tiling with a fixed number of tiles in 2009, and proved that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $11$ polyominoes is undecidable. The number of polyominoes needed to obtain undecidability was reduced from $11$ to $7$ by Yang and Zhang, and then to $5$ by Kim. We show that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $4$ (disconnected) polyominoes is undecidable in this paper.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Decomposition for Simplicial Cones and PDBarv Algorithm for Lattice Point Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting lattice points within a rational polytope is a foundational problem with applications across mathematics and computer science. A key approach is Barvinok's algorithm, which decomposes the lattice point generating function of cones to that of unimodular cones. However, standard implementations face difficulties: the original primal method struggles with points on cone boundaries, while the alternative dual method can be slow for certain cone types.
  This paper introduces two main contributions. First, We derive a closed-form expression for these generating functions using arbitrary lattice point decompositions, enabling more effective primal space decomposition. Second, by decomposing both the cone and its dual cone starting from the side with a smaller index, we develop a novel algorithm called \textup{PDBarv}. This hybrid approach integrates the primal and dual Barvinok algorithms with a novel acceleration strategy, achieving an average computational performance improvement of over 20\% in dimension 5 and even better in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Polytopality criteria for the mix of polytopes and maniplexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mix of two maniplexes is the minimal maniplex that covers both. This construction has many important applications, such as finding the smallest regular cover of a maniplex. If one of the maniplexes is an abstract polytope, a natural question to ask is whether the mix is also a polytope. We describe here a general criterion for the polytopality of the mix which generalizes several previously-known polytopality criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices'', an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle.The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

      <title>From dual canonical bases to positroidal subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grassmannian cluster algebra $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(k, n)]$ admits a distinguished basis known as the dual canonical basis, whose elements correspond to rectangular semi-standard Young tableaux with $k$ rows and with entries in $[n]$. We establish that each such tableau induces a positroidal subdivision of the hypersimplex $\Delta(k,n)$ via a map introduced by Speyer and Williams. For $\text{Gr}(2,n)$, we prove that non-frozen prime tableaux correspond precisely to the coarsest positroidal subdivisions of $\Delta(2,n)$. Furthermore, we present computational evidence extending these results to $k&gt;2$. In the process, we formulate a conjectural formula for the number of split positroidal subdivisions of $\Delta(k,n)$ for any $k \ge 2$ and explore the deep connections between the polyhedral combinatorics of $\Delta(k,n)$ and the dual canonical basis of $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(k, n)]$.</description>

      <title>Study of higher-order interactions in unweighted, undirected networks using persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology has been studied to better understand the structural properties and topology features of weighted networks. It can reveal hidden layers of information about the higher-order structures formed by non-pairwise interactions in a network. Studying of higher-order interactions (HoIs) of a system provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex system; moreover, it is a more precise depiction of the system as many complex systems, such as ecological systems and biological systems, etc., demonstrate HoIs. In this study, the weighted simplicial adjacency matrix has been constructed using the concept of adjacency strength of simplices in a clique complex obtained from an unweighted, undirected network. This weighted simplicial adjacency matrix is thus used to calculate the global measure, which is called generalised weighted betweenness centrality, which further helps us in calculating the persistent homology on the given simplicial complex by constructing a filtration on it. Moreover, a local measure called maximal generalised degree centrality has also been established for better understanding of the network topology of the studied simplicial complex. All the generalizations given in this work can be reduced to the graph-theoretic case. i.e., for a simplicial complex of dimension 1. Three different filtration schemes for constructing the sequence of simplicial complexes have been given with the help of both global and local measures, and by using these measures, the topology of higher-order structures of the studied network due to the interactions of their vertices has been compared. Further, the illustration of established definitions has been given using a real-life network by calculating Betti numbers up to dimension two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between $k$-repre\-sentable graphs and graphs representable by $k$-local words. In particular, we show that every graph representable by a $k$-local word is $(k+1)$-representable. A previous result about graphs represented by $1$-local words is revisited with new insights. Moreover, we investigate both classes of graphs w.r.t. hereditary and in particular the speed as a measure. We prove that the latter ones belong to the factorial layer and that the graphs in this classes have bounded clique-width.</description>

      <title>The optimal binding function for (cap, even hole)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em hole} is an induced cycle of length at least 4, an {\em even hole} is a hole of even length, and a {\em cap} is a graph obtained from a hole by adding an additional vertex which is adjacent exactly to two adjacent vertices of the hole. A graph $G$ obtained from a graph $H$ by blowing up all the vertices into cliques is said to be a clique blowup of $H$. Let $p, q$ be two positive integers with $p&gt;2q$, let $F$ be a triangle-free graph, and let $G'$ be a clique blowup of $F$ with $\omega(G')\leq\max\{\frac{2q(p-q-2)}{p-2q}, 2q\}$. In this paper, we prove that for any clique blowup $G$ of $F$, $\chi(G)\leq\lceil\frac{p}{2q}\omega(G)\rceil$ if and only if $\chi(G')\leq\lceil\frac{p}{2q}\omega(G')\rceil$. As its consequences, we show that every (cap, even hole)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\lceil\frac{5}{4}\omega(G)\rceil$, which affirmatively answers a question of Cameron {\em et al.} \cite{CdHV2018}, we also show that every (cap, even hole, 5-hole)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\lceil\frac{7}{6}\omega(G)\rceil$, and the bound is reachable.</description>

      <title>De Bruijn Tori Without Zeros: A Field-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algebraic construction of trace-based De Bruijn tori over finite fields, focusing on the nonzero variant that omits the all-zero pattern. The construction arranges nonzero field elements on a toroidal grid using two multiplicatively independent generators, with values obtained by applying a fixed linear map, typically the field trace.
  We characterize sampling patterns as subsets whose associated field elements form an \( \mathbb{F}_p \)-basis, and show that column structures correspond to cyclic shifts of De Bruijn sequences determined by irreducible polynomials over subfields. Recursive update rules based on multiplicative translations enable efficient computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a natural definition of an elliptic arrangement, extending the classical framework to an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication. We analyse the intersections of elements of the arrangement and their connected components as End(E)-modules. Furthermore, we prove that the combinatorial data of elliptic arrangements define both an arithmetic matroid and a matroid over the ring End(E). In this way, we obtain a class of arithmetic matroids that is different from the class of arithmetic matroids realizable via toric arrangements. Finally, we show that the Euler characteristic of the complement is an evaluation of the arithmetic Tutte polynomial.</description>

      <title>Infinite polynomial patterns in large subsets of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson, we prove two new results about infinite polynomial configurations in large subsets of the rational numbers. First, given a finite coloring of $\mathbb{Q}$, we show that there exists an infinite set $B = \{b_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\{b_i, b_i^2 + b_j : i &lt; j\}$ is monochromatic. Second, we prove that every subset of positive density in the rational numbers contains a translate of such an infinite configuration.
  The proofs build upon methods developed in a series of papers by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson to translate from combinatorics into dynamics, where the core of the argument reduces to understanding the behavior of certain polynomial ergodic averages. The new dynamical tools required for this analysis are a Wiener--Wintner theorem for polynomially-twisted ergodic averages in $\mathbb{Q}$-systems and a structure theorem for Abramov $\mathbb{Q}$-systems.
  The end of the paper includes a discussion of related problems in the integers.</description>

      <title>The Origami flip graph of the $2\times n$ Miura-ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an origami crease pattern $C=(V,E)$, a straight-line planar graph embedded in a region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, we assign each crease to be either a mountain crease (which bends convexly) or a valley crease (which bends concavely), creating a mountain-valley (MV) assignment $\mu:E\to\{-1,1\}$. An MV assignment $\mu$ is locally valid if the faces around each vertex in $C$ can be folded flat under $\mu$. In this paper, we investigate locally valid MV assignments of the Miura-ori, $M_{m,n}$, an $m\times n$ parallelogram tessellation used in numerous engineering applications. The origami flip graph $OFG(C)$ of $C$ is a graph whose vertices are locally valid MV assignments of $C$, and two vertices are adjacent if they differ by a face flip, an operation that swaps the MV-parity of every crease bordering a given face of $C$. We enumerate the number of vertices and edges in $OFG(M_{2,n})$ and prove several facts about the degrees of vertices in $OFG(M_{2,n})$. By finding recurrence relations, we show that the number of vertices of degree $d$ and $2n-a$ (for $0\leq a$) are both described by polynomials of particular degrees. We then prove that the diameter of $OFG(M_{2,n})$ is $\lceil \frac{n^2}{2}\rceil$ using techniques from 3-coloring reconfiguration graphs.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton cycle space of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycle space of a graph $G$, denoted $C(G)$, is a vector space over ${\mathbb F}_2$, spanned by all incidence vectors of edge-sets of cycles of $G$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices, then $C_n(G)$ denotes the subspace of $C(G)$, spanned by the incidence vectors of Hamilton cycles of $G$. A classical result in the theory of random graphs asserts that for $G \sim \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, asymptotically almost surely the necessary condition $\delta(G) \geq 2$ is also sufficient to ensure Hamiltonicity. Resolving a problem of Christoph, Nenadov, and Petrova, we augment this result by proving that for $G \sim \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, with $n$ being odd, asymptotically almost surely the condition $\delta(G) \geq 3$ (observed to be necessary by Heinig) is also sufficient for ensuring $C_n(G) = C(G)$. That is, not only does $G$ typically have a Hamilton cycle, but its Hamilton cycles are typically rich enough to span its cycle space.</description>

      <title>Complete polyhedral description of chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical graphs are simple undirected connected graphs, where vertices represent atoms in a molecule and edges represent chemical bonds. A degree-based topological index is a molecular descriptor used to study specific physicochemical properties of molecules. Such an index is computed from the sum of the weights of the edges of a chemical graph, each edge having a weight defined by a formula that depends only on the degrees of its endpoints. Given any degree-based topological index and given two integers $n$ and $m$, we are interested in determining chemical graphs of order $n$ and size $m$ that maximize or minimize the index. Focusing on chemical graphs with maximum degree at most 3, we show that this reduces to determining the extreme points of a polytope that contains at most 10 facets. We also show that the number of extreme points is at most 16, which means that for any given $n$ and $m$, there are very few different classes of extremal graphs, independently of the chosen degree-based topological index.</description>

      <title>Prime simplicial complexes of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prime simplicial complex $\Pi(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is composed of all sets of primes $S$ where $G$ has an element of order the product of primes in $S$, with the subsets partially ordered by inclusion. This complex was introduced by Peter Cameron as the generalisation of the well-studied prime (or Gruenberg-Kegel) graphs. In this paper, we establish new results concerning two key properties of $\Pi(G)$: recognisability and purity. We demonstrate that recognisability by the prime simplicial complex is strictly stronger than recognisability by the prime graph. Notably, we present the first known example of a group that is recognisable by its prime simplicial complex and spectrum, but not by its prime graph, and is not a direct product of two isomorphic simple groups. Furthermore, we classify groups with pure prime simplicial complexes (i.e., all maximal simplices have the same size) across several infinite families of finite simple groups. We also provide a partial classification for non-abelian finite simple groups whose prime simplicial complex has maximal simplices of size at most 2.</description>

      <title>The longest increasing subsequence of Brownian separable permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a scaling limit result for the length $\operatorname{LIS}(\sigma_n)$ of the longest increasing subsequence of a permutation $\sigma_n$ of size $n$ sampled from the Brownian separable permuton $\boldsymbol{\mu}_p$ of parameter $p\in(0,1)$, which is the universal limit of pattern-avoiding permutations. Specifically, we prove that \[\frac{\operatorname{LIS}(\sigma_n)}{n^\alpha}\;\underset{n\to\infty}{\overset{\mathrm{a.s.}}{\longrightarrow}}\; X,\] where $\alpha=\alpha(p)$ is the unique solution in the interval $(1/2,1)$ to the equation \[\frac{1}{4^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}\sqrt{\pi}}\,\frac{\Gamma\big(\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{2\alpha}\big)}{\Gamma\big(1-\tfrac{1}{2\alpha}\big)}=\frac{p}{p-1},\] and $X=X(p)$ is a non-deterministic and a.s. positive and finite random variable, which is a measurable function of the Brownian separable permuton. Notably, the exponent $\alpha(p)$ is an increasing continuous function of $p$ with $\alpha(0^+)=1/2$, $\alpha(1^-)=1$ and $\alpha(1/2)\approx0.815226$, which corresponds to the permuton limit of uniform separable permutations. We prove analogous results for the size of the largest clique of a graph sampled from the Brownian cographon of parameter $p\in(0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19197v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>

      <title>Local Search Improvements for Soft Happy Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19284v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$ and a coloured graph $G$, a vertex $v$ is $\rho$-happy if at least $\rho \mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours have the same colour as $v$. Soft happy colouring of a partially coloured graph $G$ is the problem of finding a vertex colouring $\sigma$ that preserves the precolouring and has the maximum number of $\rho$-happy vertices. It is already known that this problem is NP-hard and directly relates to the community structure of the graphs; under a certain condition on the proportion of happiness $\rho$ and for graphs with community structures, the induced colouring by communities can make all the vertices $\rho$-happy. We show that when $0\leq \rho_1&lt;\rho_2\leq 1$, a complete $\rho_2$-happy colouring has a higher accuracy of community detection than a complete $\rho_1$-happy colouring. Moreover, when $\rho$ is greater than a threshold, it is unlikely for an algorithm to find a complete $\rho$-happy colouring with colour classes of almost equal sizes. Three local search algorithms for soft happy colouring are proposed, and their performances are compared with one another and other known algorithms. Among them, the linear-time local search is shown to be not only very fast, but also a reliable algorithm that can dramatically improve the number of $\rho$-happy vertices.</description>

      <title>Expanders in Models of Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common model for social networks are Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), in which vertices draw a random position in some latent geometric space, and the probability of two vertices forming an edge depends on their geometric distance. The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points are defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined as close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is mathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the second option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different dimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such cases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions. For the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor expanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance GIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\ge 2$, and that they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable constant $C&gt;0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least $(\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of the resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this expansion factor is $\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant fraction of the vertices. This has far-reaching consequences, since many algorithms and mixing processes are fast on expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Paired Disjunctive Domination Number of Middle Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of domination in graphs plays a central role in understanding structural properties and applications in network theory. In this study, we focus on the paired disjunctive domination number in the context of middle graphs, a transformation that captures both adjacency and incidence relations of the original graph. We begin by investigating this parameter for middle graphs of several special graph classes, including path graphs, cycle graphs, wheel graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs, friendship graphs, and double star graphs. We then present general results by establishing lower and upper bounds for the paired disjunctive domination number in middle graphs of arbitrary graphs, with particular emphasis on trees. Additionally, we determine the exact value of the parameter for middle graphs obtained through the join operation. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of domination-type parameters in transformed graph structures and offer new insights into their combinatorial behavior.</description>

      <title>The nilpotent graph of a finite0-dimensional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field $F$. In This paper we introduce the \emph{nilpotent graph} $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ as the graph whose vertices are the elements of $L \setminus \nil(L)$, where \[\nil(L) = \{x \in L \mid \langle x, y \rangle \text{ is nilpotent for all } y \in L\},\] and where two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent if the Lie subalgebra they generate is nilpotent. We give some characterizations of $\nil(L)$ and its connection with the hypercenter $Z^*(L)$, for example, they are equal when $F$ has characteristic zero. We prove that the nilpotentizer behaves well under direct sums, allowing a decomposition of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ between components. The paper also investigates the structural and combinatorial properties of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$, including the conditions under which the graph is connected. We characterize the existence of strongly self-centralizing subalgebras in relation to connectivity and vertex isolation. Explicit computations are carried out for the algebra $\mathfrak{t}(2,\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ decomposes into $q+1$ components, each of size $q(q-1)$, forming a $(q^2-q-1)$-regular graph. We conclude with algorithms for constructing $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ in SageMath, and pose open problems concerning bipartiteness, regularity, and structural implications in higher dimensions over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Intersection theorems for families of matchings of complete $k$-partite $k$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem states that for $n \geq 2k$ a family $\mathscr{F}$ of $k$ subsets of $[n]$ for which each pair of members of $\mathscr{F}$ have a non-empty intersection has size at most $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ and for $n &gt;2k$ has exactly this size if and only if it is the family of all $k$-subsets of $[n]$ containing a fixed element $x\in [n]$. Since its discovery, the {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem has be generalised extensively and many variants have been found for structures other than sets. One such variant is for permutations and so-called generalised permutations. These structures are equivalent to $r$-matchings of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$ with $r \leq \min\{n,m\}$ in a natural way.
  The culmination of results of several groups of authors constitute an {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem for families of generalised permutations and so for families of $r$-matchings of $K_{n,m}$ for all feasible values of $r,n$ and $m$. In this paper we generalise this by proving an {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem for families of $r$-matchings of complete $k$-partite $k$-graphs, which can be seen as a partial generalisation of the {Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado} Theorem itself. We also prove similar results for $t$-intersecting families, and for families of matchings whose members have sizes from some set of integers $R$, rather than a single size $r$.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Regular Integers Modulo $n$ and Its Significance to Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02471v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give four alternative proofs to a formula on the number of non-congruent regular integers modulo $n$, where an integer $m$ is regular modulo $n$ if $m^2 x \equiv m \pmod{n}$ has a solution for $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. The formula, which expresses this number in terms of Euler totients of unitary divisors of $n$, is related to some recent variant of the RSA cryptosystem for regular integers modulo $n$, which is briefly outlined to underpin its significance.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to phase transitions in random graph isomorphism problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, with possibly different parameters, and study two isomorphism problems, a graph embedding problem and a common subgraph problem. Under certain conditions on the graph parameters we show a sharp asymptotic phase transition as the graph sizes tend to infinity. This extends known results for the case of uniform Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, naturally leading to several related problems for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Matroid products via submodular coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of matroid products traces back to the 1970s, when Lov\'asz and Mason studied the existence of various types of matroid products with different strengths. Among these, the tensor product is arguably the most important, which can be considered as an extension of the tensor product from linear algebra. However, Las Vergnas showed that the tensor product of two matroids does not always exist. Over the following four decades, matroid products remained surprisingly underexplored, regaining attention only in recent years due to applications in tropical geometry and the limit theory of matroids.
  In this paper, inspired by the concept of coupling in probability theory, we introduce the notion of coupling for matroids -- or, more generally, for submodular set functions. This operation can be viewed as a relaxation of the tensor product. Unlike the tensor product, however, we prove that a coupling always exists for any two submodular functions and can be chosen to be increasing if the original functions are increasing. As a corollary, we show that two matroids always admit a matroid coupling, leading to a novel operation on matroids. Our construction is algorithmic, providing an oracle for the coupling matroid through a polynomial number of oracle calls to the original matroids.
  We apply this construction to derive new necessary conditions for matroid representability and establish connection between tensor products and Ingleton's inequality. Additionally, we verify the existence of set functions that are universal with respect to a given property, meaning any set function over a finite domain with that property can be obtained as a quotient.</description>

      <title>The major index (maj) and its Sch\"utzenberger dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the independent particle representation for the Semistandard Young Tableaux (SsYT) of skew shape $\lambda/\mu.$ The partition function of this particle system gives the generating function of the SsYT of skew shape $\lambda/\mu.$ Thus we obtain a bijective proof of the Stanley formula for the SsYT generating function.
  To do this we define for every SsYT $T$ its plinth, $\mathsf{p}\left( T\right) ,$ which is a SsYT of the same shape $\lambda/\mu.$ The set of plinths is finite. Our bijection associates to every SsYT $T$ a pair $\left( \mathsf{p}\left( T\right) ,Y\left( T-\mathsf{p}\left( T\right) \right) \right) ,$ where $Y\left( T-\mathsf{p}\left( T\right) \right) $ is the reading Young diagram of the SsYT $\left( T-\mathsf{p}\left( T\right) \right) $. \newline In particular, every Standard Young Tableau (SYT) $P$ has its plinth, $\mathsf{p}\left( P\right) $. The two statistics of SYT-s -- the volume $\left\vert \mathsf{p}\left( P\right) \right\vert $ and $\mathsf{maj}\left( P\right) $ -- are related via the Sch\"{u}tzenberger involution $Sch:$% \[ \left\vert \mathsf{p}\left( P\right) \right\vert =\mathsf{maj}\left( Sch\left( P\right) \right) . \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six non-affine 3-parameter families of complex Hadamard matrices of order 8 are presented. These families contain Hadamard matrices that are not equivalent to any previously known Hadamard matrices in the literature. Each family arises from unimodular points of an affine variety defined by palindromic polynomials. The families are given as an image of a function that solves the corresponding system of polynomials on a domain that guarantees unimodularity of the solutions</description>

      <title>Game Connectivity and Adaptive Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10609v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity properties of their best-response graphs. Our central result shows that, among games that are `generic' (without indifferences) and that have a pure Nash equilibrium, all but a small fraction are \emph{connected}, meaning that every action profile that is not a pure Nash equilibrium can reach every pure Nash equilibrium via best-response paths. This has important implications for dynamics in games. In particular, we show that there are simple, uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a small fraction of generic games that have one (which contrasts with the known fact that there is no such dynamic that leads almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in \emph{every} generic game that has one). We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our characterisation of game connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define integer multimodal sequences, which are generalizations of unimodal sequences having multiple local peaks of equal size. The generating functions for multimodal sequences represent novel types of $q$-series that combine generating functions for both integer partitions and integer compositions. We prove a bijection between multimodal sequences of equal size (sum), and show that multimodal generating functions become finite series at roots of unity like the ``strange'' function of Kontsevich, quantum modular forms, and other examples of this phenomenon in the $q$-series literature.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained, linear reduction from 3-SAT to Treewidth. Specifically, it shows that 1.00005-approximating Treewidth is NP-hard, and solving Treewidth exactly requires $2^{\Omega(n)}$ time, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. We further derive, under the latter assumption, that there are some constants $\delta &gt; 1$ and $c&gt;0$ such that $\delta$-approximating Treewidth requires time $2^{\Omega(n/\log^c n)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>
