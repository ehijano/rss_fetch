      <title>IQPopt: Fast optimization of instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IQPopt is a software package designed to optimize large-scale instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits on classical hardware. By exploiting an efficient classical simulation algorithm for expectation value estimation, circuits with thousands of qubits and millions of gates can be optimized, provided the relevant objective function has an efficient description in terms of Pauli-Z type observables. Since sampling from instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits is widely believed to be hard for classical computers, this provides a method to identify powerful circuit instances before deployment and sampling on quantum hardware, where computational advantages may exist. The package leverages automatic differentiation in JAX, can be accelerated with access to hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units, and contains a dedicated module that can be used to train and evaluate quantum generative models via the maximum mean discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Using quantum nonlocality for device-independent confirmation of relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronizing clocks to measure time is a fundamental process underpinning every practical communication task from GPS to parallel computation. However, as the current protocols are based on classical communication between the sender and receiver, they are prone to simple attacks that could cause a slight delay in the signal which would then cause a massive error in further operations. In this work, we first explain a simple attack that in principle can cause an arbitrary delay in the signal between sender and receiver. We then propose a way to overcome this problem by using a recently contrived idea of device-independent certification which utilises quantum nonlocality. Consequently, clocks can be synchronized in a highly secure way without trusting any devices in the setup. We then extend this proposal to observe relativistic time dilation in a device-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in cyclic sign invariant quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study bipartite quantum states that are invariant under the local action of the cyclic sign group. Due to symmetry, these states are sparse and can be parameterized by a triple of vectors. Their important semi-definite properties, such as positivity and positivity under partial transpose (PPT), can be simply characterized in terms of these vectors and their discrete Fourier transforms. We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing in particular that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. We provide some geometric results for the PPT cone, showing in particular that it is polyhedral. In local dimension less than 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. Finally, we initiate the study of cyclic sign covariant quantum channels, showing in particular that the PPT squared conjecture holds for some of these maps.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines for Stress Detection in Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress can increase the possibility of cognitive impairment and decrease the quality of life in older adults. Smart healthcare can deploy quantum machine learning to enable preventive and diagnostic support. This work introduces a unique technique to address stress detection as an anomaly detection problem that uses quantum hybrid support vector machines. With the help of a wearable smartwatch, we mapped baseline sensor reading as normal data and stressed sensor reading as anomaly data using cortisol concentration as the ground truth. We have used quantum computing techniques to explore the complex feature spaces with kernel-based preprocessing. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by doing experimental validation on 40 older adults with the help of the TSST protocol. Our findings highlight that using a limited number of features, quantum machine learning provides improved accuracy compared to classical methods. We also observed that the recall value using quantum machine learning is higher compared to the classical method. The higher recall value illustrates the potential of quantum machine learning in healthcare, as missing anomalies could result in delayed diagnostics or treatment.</description>

      <title>An examination of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and considerations for experimental detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent works we have explored a multi-photon extension of the celebrated two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect in which the quantum amplitudes for a two-photon input to a lossless, balanced 50:50 beamsplitter (BS) undergoes complete destructive interference. In the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect the multi-photon scattering of photons from the two input ports to the two output ports of the BS for Fock number basis input states (FS) $|n,m\rangle_{12}$ exhibit complete destructive interference pairwise within the quantum amplitudes containing many scattering components, generalizing the two-photon HOM effect. This has profound implications for arbitrary bipartite photonic input states constructed from such basis states: if the input state to one input port of the BS is of odd parity, i.e. constructed from only of odd numbers of photons, then regardless of the input state to the second 50:50 BS port, there will be a central nodal line (CNL) of zeros in the joint output probability distribution along the main diagonal for coincidence detection. The first goal of this present work is to show diagrammatically how the extended HOM effect can be seen as a succession of multi-photon HOM effects when the latter is viewed as a pairwise cancellation of mirror image scattering amplitudes. The second goal of this work is to explore considerations for the experimental realization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We examine the case of a single photon interfering with a coherent state (an idealized laser) on a balanced 50:50 beamsplitter and consider prospects for experimental detection of the output destructive interference by including additional effects such as imperfect detection efficiency, spatio-temporal mode functions, and time delay between the detected output photons.</description>

      <title>Beyond Integral-Domain Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes aim to protect information in quantum systems to enable fault-tolerant quantum computations. The most prevalent method, stabilizer codes, has been well developed for many varieties of systems, however, largely the case of composite number of levels in the system has been avoided. This relative absence is due to the underlying ring theoretic tools required for analyzing such systems. Here we explore composite local-dimension quantum stabilizer codes, providing a pair of constructions for transforming known stabilizer codes into valid ones for composite local-dimensions. In addition remarks on logical encodings and the counts possible are discussed. This work lays out central methods for working with composite dimensional systems, enabling full use of the computational space of some systems, and expanding the understanding of the symplectic spaces involved.</description>

      <title>Response Kinetic Uncertainty Relation for Markovian Open Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and kinetics of a nonequilibrium classical system fundamentally constrain the precision of an observable regarding the celebrated thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR). They have been extended to open quantum systems obeying the Lindblad master equation where unique quantum effects are identified. Recently, a new set of principles that further incorporate the response of a classical system to an external perturbation have been discovered, named the response TUR and the response KUR (R-KUR). In this work, we generalize the classical R-KUR using the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. The precision and the sensitivity of a measured observable are bounded from above by the conventional quantum dynamical activity and a perturbation-induced inter-subspace transition term. We provide sufficient conditions such that either of the two contributions vanishes, implying their equal importance. We verify our result and illustrate the conditions in an exactly solvable two-level atom.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Concatenated Quantum Codes: Parameters and Asymptotic Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement-assisted concatenated quantum codes (EACQCs) are constructed by concatenating two entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). By selecting the inner and outer component codes carefully, it is able to construct state-of-the-art EACQCs with parameters better than previous quantum codes. In this work, we use almost maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes and $\hbar$-MDS codes as the outer codes to construct EACQCs. Because the range of code length of almost MDS and $\hbar$-MDS codes is much more free than that of the commonly used MDS codes. We derive several families of new EACQCs with parameters better than the previously best known EAQECCs and standard quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) of the same length and net transmissions. Moreover, we demonstrate that EACQCs are with maximal entanglement if both the inner and outer component codes are with maximal entanglement. As a result, we construct three new maximal-entanglement EACQCs which have optimal parameters. In addition, we present several new maximal-entanglement EACQCs whose minimum distance is only one less than the minimum distance of the optimal codes. In particular, we propose two new families of asymptotically good maximal-entanglement EACQCs with explicit constructions by using entanglement-assisted quantum algebraic geometry codes as the outer codes. At last, we prove that EACQCs can attain the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound for EAQECCs asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in microwave optomechanical circuits via coupling engineering to a common environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is one of the essential collective behaviors and has extensive applications. Exploiting a common environment, we establish synchronization in microwave optomechanical circuits. Through analysis and numerical calculations, we study the synchronization dynamics of three nonidentical and mechanically isolated optomechanical resonators. Each resonator supports a microwave mode and a mechanical mode, which are coupled via radiation-pressure type optomechanical interaction. The common environment induces indirect coupling between any two resonators, which can be described by an effective non-Hermitian interaction Hamiltonian. Combined with the Hermitian interaction regulated by the tunable coupler, we demonstrate that the common environment breaks the reciprocity of the interaction. We propose several special microwave optomechanical circuits with nonreciprocal or even unidirectional interactions, and study the regulation of synchronization dynamics by the common environment. By utilizing the excellent tunability of superconducting circuits, we show that different synchronization states can be switched in a controllable way. This work may open up a new way for synchronization research and have potential applications in synchronization networks.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity Generation of Bell and W States in Giant Atom System via Bound State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity scheme for generating entangled states in a system of two and three giant atoms coupled to the coupled resonator waveguide. Our approach leverages the bound state in the continuum, which is robust against waveguide disorder. Specifically, we achieve a fidelity exceeding $98\%$ for Bell state generation, overcoming the limitations of conventional decoherence-free interaction mechanisms. This scheme can be readily extended to a three-giant-atom system for generating W states. In both the two- and three-atom setups, the maximally entangled states are generated in a short time and remain stable even as time approaches infinity. Our proposal is feasible for implementation on state-of-the-art solid-state quantum platforms and significantly broadens the applications of giant atoms and waveguide QED system in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Criticality-Enhanced Global Quantum Sensing via Non-Equilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum critical systems offer promising advancements in quantum sensing and metrology, yet face limitations like critical slowing down and a restricted criticality-enhanced region. Here, we introduce a critical sensing scheme that mitigate critical slowing down by leveraging the non-equilibrium dynamics of a perturbed Ising spin model, coupled with an adaptive strategy to enlarge its sensing interval. We validate the proposed scheme on a superconducting quantum processor and demonstrate that our scheme achieves a Heisenberg scaling with respect to the encoding duration. Additionally, the adaptive strategy tunes the model to operate near its critical point with limited prior information about the parameter, enabling what is known as global sensing. Our work showcases the metrological applications empowered by non-equilibrium critical dynamics and hence opens up a pathway for devising critical quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Improved finite-size analysis for measurement-device-independent quantum digital signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum digital signatures (QDS), based on the principles of quantum mechanics, provide information-theoretic security, ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data transmission. With present QDS protocols, measurement-device-independent QDS (MDI-QDS) can resist all attacks on detections, yet it suffers from finite-size effect. In this work, we present and compare three parameter estimation models for finite-size analysis of two-decoy MDI-QDS. The first model is a commonly used model in previous schemes, and we propose two new models to improve the performance. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of the three models. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods are less affected by finite-size effect, thereby effectively enhancing the signature rate. This work contributes to the practical development of QDS.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the Spectroscopic measurements of Kerr non-linear resonators with four-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a promising way to solve combinational optimization problems where the solutions correspond to the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian. We can implement quantum annealing using the Kerr non-linear resonators, with bifurcation phenomena emerging when subjected to a parametric drive. These bifurcated states can function as bases of qubits. Moreover, integrating four-body interactions between physical qubits enables the establishment of effective all-to-all long-range interactions between logical qubits, which is essential for practical quantum annealing. While theoretical proposals exist for creating four-body interactions within Kerr non-linear resonators, there has not been experimental verification through their spectroscopic signatures. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the spectroscopic measurements of Kerr non-linear resonators featuring four-body interaction. We identify six distinct frequencies exhibiting population changes by employing resonant driving on one resonator and weak driving on another. Analytical and numerical calculations validate these findings. Our study demonstrates the potential of spectroscopy in characterizing systems with four-body interactions, offering insights for realizing quantum annealing with Kerr parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced causal discovery for a small number of samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, epidemiology, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are often associated with nonlinear causal structures, which make the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not assume any underlying model structures. Based on the independence conditional tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed qPC algorithm can explore causal relationships from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graph parts of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits a significantly better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for robust and accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the Boston Housing dataset as a real-world application. These findings demonstrate the new potential of quantum circuit-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios where traditional approaches have shown limitations.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM), conceived as an error suppression paradigm without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on the spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Min-Sum Decoding of Quantum Codes Using Previous Iteration Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel message-passing decoding approach that leverages the degeneracy of quantum low-density parity-check codes to enhance decoding performance, eliminating the need for serial scheduling or post-processing. Our focus is on two-block Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which are composed of symmetric stabilizers that hinder the performance of conventional iterative decoders with uniform update rules. Specifically, our analysis shows that, under the isolation assumption, the min-sum decoder fails to converge when constant-weight errors are applied to symmetric stabilizers, as variable-to-check messages oscillate in every iteration. To address this, we introduce a decoding technique that exploits this oscillatory property by applying distinct update rules: variable nodes in one block utilize messages from previous iterations, while those in the other block are updated conventionally. Logical error-rate results demonstrate that the proposed decoder significantly outperforms the normalized min-sum decoder and achieves competitive performance with belief propagation enhanced by order-zero ordered statistics decoding, all while maintaining linear complexity in the code's block length.</description>

      <title>Predicting Spin-Dependent Coulomb Interaction Based on the Yang-Mills Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Coulomb interaction is one of four fundamental interactions in Nature. It is interesting to know how will the standard Coulomb interaction be modified when it meets spin. Since the standard Coulomb potential is a simple but fundamental solution of Maxwell's equations, hence Maxwell's equations can predict the existence of the standard Coulomb potential. The Yang-Mills equations are the natural generalizations of Maxwell's equations from the Abelian potentials to the non-Abelian ones, thus based on the Yang-Mills equations, one can predict the reasonable form of spin-dependent Coulomb potential, which naturally reduces the standard Coulomb potential if without considering the spin. Our work sheds a new light to how to couple spin with fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimizing the Expected Performance of Sampling-Based Quantum-Inspired Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms has received much attention due to its exponential speedup compared to existing algorithms, under certain data storage assumptions. The improvements are noticeable in fundamental linear algebra tasks. In this work, we analyze two major subroutines in sampling-based quantum-inspired algorithms, specifically, inner product estimation and sampling from a linear combination of vectors, and discuss their possible improvements by generalizing the data structure. The idea is to consider the average behavior of the subroutines under certain assumptions regarding the data elements. This allows us to determine the optimal data structure, and the high-dimensional nature of data makes our assumptions reasonable. Experimental results from recommendation systems also highlight a consistent preference for our proposed data structure. Motivated by this observation, we tighten the upper bound on the number of required measurements for direct fidelity estimation. We expect our findings to suggest optimal implementations for various quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms that involve extremely high-dimensional operations, which has potential for many applications.</description>

      <title>Almost Optimal Synthesis of Reversible Function in Qudit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oracles are widely adopted in problems, like query oracle in Grover's algorithm, cipher in quantum cryptanalytic and data encoder in quantum machine learning. Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\Theta(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits. Moreover, we introduce a technique for synthesizing reversible functions employing $O\left( n d^{n} \right)$ gates and only a single ancilla. This is asymptotically tight in terms of $d$ and asymptotically almost tight in terms of $n$.</description>

      <title>Grid Cost Allocation in Peer-to-Peer Electricity Markets: Benchmarking Classical and Quantum Optimization Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel optimization approach for allocating grid operation costs in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electricity markets using Quantum Computing (QC). We develop a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model that matches logical power flows between producer-consumer pairs with the physical power flow to distribute grid usage costs fairly. The model is evaluated on IEEE test cases with up to 57 nodes, comparing Quantum Annealing (QA), hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and classical optimization approaches. Our results show that while the model effectively allocates grid operation costs, QA performs poorly in comparison despite extensive hyperparameter optimization. The classical branch-and-cut method outperforms all solvers, including classical heuristics, and shows the most advantageous scaling behavior. The findings may suggest that binary least-squares optimization problems may not be suitable candidates for near-term quantum utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum compilation is the process of decomposing high-level quantum algorithms or arbitrary unitary operations into quantum circuits composed of a specific set of quantum gates. Neutral atom quantum computing platform is a quantum computing implementation method with high controllability and scalability, but its quantum compilation method is not mature. We systematically review the quantum compilation methods based on matrix decomposition, and propose a compilation algorithm suitable for neutral atom quantum computing, which can effectively decompose any unitary operation into a series of quantum gates suitable for the neutral atom platform, and ensure that the generated quantum circuits can run directly on the platform.</description>

      <title>The application of annealing in quantum cooling protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by simulated annealing algorithm, we propose a quantum cooling protocol which includes an annealing process. This protocol can be universally and efficiently applied to various quantum simulators, driving the system from an arbitrary initial state to the ground state with high fidelity. We have described the cooling process based on perturbation theory, validated the advantages of bath under time-modulated Zeeman field compared to bath under static one, and provided a justification for the necessity of an annealing process when the system to be cooled is unknown. We applied tensor network methods to numerically simulate our cooling protocol, using the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) as an example to verify the effectiveness of the protocol in cooling one-dimensional systems, two-dimensional systems, and systems with quantum noise. We compared the overall performance of cooling protocols with and without the annealing process on a test set generated with random parameters $g_P$. The results indicate that the cooling protocol with annealing process can achieve both accuracy and efficiency. Our results also show that the cooling protocol's resistance to noise depends on the type of quantum noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are a rich area of research on the intersection of quantum mechanics and stochastic analysis. We unify multiple views of controlled open quantum systems within the framework of bilinear dynamical systems. We define the corresponding notions of identifiability from the results of quantum state tomography, obtained in many copies of the initial quantum state, under subsequences of varying lengths of control signals. We explain and extend work on identifiability of bilinear systems using either spectral criteria, criteria based on Hankel matrix, and frequency-domain criteria, to the parameter estimation of master equations of open quantum systems. This sets the groundwork for a number of constructive approaches to the identification of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Properties from Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization is a prominent candidate for early fault tolerant quantum simulation of many-body and molecular systems, but so far the focus has been mainly on computing ground-state energies. We go beyond this by deriving analytical first-order derivatives for quantum Krylov methods and show how to obtain relaxed one and two particle reduced density matrices of the Krylov eigenstates. The direct approach to measuring these matrices requires a number of distinct measurement that scales quadratically with the Krylov dimension $D$. Here, we show how to reduce this scaling to a constant. This is done by leveraging quantum signal processing to prepare Krylov eigenstates, including exited states, in depth linear in $D$. We also compare several measurement schemes for efficiently obtaining the expectation value of an operator with states prepared using quantum signal processing. We validate our approach by computing the nuclear gradient of a small molecule and estimating its variance.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-Party Biometric Verification using QKD assisted Quantum Oblivious Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical implementation of a secure multiparty computation application enabled by quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) on an entanglement-based physical layer. The QOT protocol uses polarization-encoded entangled states to share oblivious keys between two parties with quantum key distribution (QKD) providing authentication. Our system integrates the post-processing for QKD and QOT, both sharing a single physical layer, ensuring efficient key generation and authentication. Authentication involves hashing messages into a crypto-context, verifying tags, and replenishing keys through a parallel QKD pipeline, which handles both key post-processing and authentication. Oblivious keys are generated over 12.9 km with a channel loss of 8.47 dB. In a back-to-back setup, a QOT rate of $9.3\times10^{-3}$ OTs/second is achieved, corresponding to 1 minute and 48 seconds per OT, primarily limited by the entanglement source. Using pre-distributed keys improved the rate to 0.11 OTs/second, or 9.1 seconds per OT. The considered QOT protocol is statistically correct, computationally secure for an honest receiver, and statistically secure for an honest sender, assuming a computationally hiding, statistically binding commitment, and a verifiable error-correcting scheme. A practical use case is demonstrated for privacy-preserving fingerprint matching against no-fly lists from Interpol and the United Nations. The fingerprint is secret-shared across two sites, ensuring security, while the matching is performed using the MASCOT protocol, supported by QOT. The application required 128 OTs, with the highest security achieved in 20 minutes and 39 seconds. This work demonstrates the feasibility of QOT in secure quantum communication applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric optimization method for implementing quantum gates by optimally controlling the Hamiltonian parameters, aiming to approach the Mandelstam-Tamm Quantum Speed Limit (MT-QSL). Achieving this bound requires satisfying precise geometric conditions governing the evolution of quantum states. We extend this geometric framework to quantum unitary operators in arbitrary dimensions and analyze the conditions necessary for saturation of the bound. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum brachistochrone, when generalized to operators, does not generally reach the MT-QSL bound. Finally, we propose a systematic optimal control strategy based on geometric principles to approach the quantum speed limit for unitary driving.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum cellular automata for one-dimensional chains of Fermionic modes and study their implementability as finite depth quantum circuits. Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of Fermionic automata is found which cannot be expressed in terms of single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts, as is the case for qubit cellular automata.</description>

      <title>A learning agent-based approach to the characterization of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes is crucial for the execution of quantum algorithms on available quantum devices. A powerful framework for this purpose is the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) which characterizes a given system by learning its Hamiltonian via adaptive generations of informative experiments and their validation against simulated models. Identifying the incoherent noise of a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as essential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows to devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example via quantum error correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA) framework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By simultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently captures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system. The added complexity of open systems necessitates advanced algorithmic strategies. Among these, we implement regularization to steer the algorithm towards plausible models and an unbiased metric to evaluate the quality of the results. We validate our implementation in simulated scenarios of increasing complexity, demonstrating its robustness to hardware-induced measurement errors and its ability to characterize systems using only local operations. Additionally, we develop a scheme to interface oQMLA with a publicly available superconducting quantum computer, showcasing its practical utility. These advancements represent a significant step toward improving the performance of quantum hardware and contribute to the broader goal of advancing quantum technologies and their applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum system calibration is limited by the ability to characterize a quantum state under unknown device errors. We develop an accurate calibration protocol that is blind to the precise preparation of a specific quantum state. It extracts device errors from simple tomographic data only, and does not require bespoke experiments for a priori specified error mechanisms. Using a trapped-ion quantum computer, we experimentally demonstrate the accuracy of the method by recovering intentional miscalibrations. We then use blind calibration to estimate the native calibration parameters of the experimental system. The recovered calibrations are close to directly measured values and perform similarly in predicting state properties.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling in a Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growing number of quantum networks in operation, there is a pressing need for performance analysis of quantum switching technologies. A quantum switch establishes, distributes, and maintains entanglements across a network. In contrast to a classical switching fabric, a quantum switch is a two sided queueing network. The switch generates Link Level Entanglements (LLEs), which are then fused to process the networks entanglement requests. Our proof techniques analyse a two time scale separation phenomenon at the fluid scale for a general switch topology. This allows us to demonstrate that the optimal fluid dynamics are given by a scheduling algorithm that solves a certain average reward Markov Decision Process.</description>

Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is an emerging technique that decouples the processes of illuminating an object and projecting its image. The properties of the illuminating and detected light can thus be simultaneously optimised for both contrast on a sample and sensitivity on a camera. Here, we combine QIUP with computed tomography to enable three-dimensional (3D) infrared imaging. The image data is registered with a standard silicon camera at a wavelength of 810 nm, but the extracted 3D images map the sample's absorption at a wavelength of 1550 nm, well beyond the camera's sensitivity. Quantum Undetected Optical Projection Tomography (QUOPT) enables label-free volumetric sensing at difficult to detect wavelengths, such as those that allow molecular imaging contrast, or those within the infrared biological transmission windows.</description>

      <title>Efficient Qubit Calibration by Binary-Search Hamiltonian Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-time method for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit. The real-time processing capabilities of a controller dynamically compute adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. We show the algorithm's efficacy by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. By feeding forward the updated qubit frequency, the FPGA-powered control electronics also mitigates non-Markovian noise in the system, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states with the repeated interaction protocol: Relaxation dynamics and energetic cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a qubit system interacting with thermalized bath-ancilla spins via a repeated interaction scheme. Considering generic initial conditions for the system and employing a Heisenberg-type interaction between the system and the ancillas, we analytically prove the following: (i) The population and coherences of the system qubit evolve independently toward a nonequilibrium steady-state solution, which is diagonal in the qubit's energy eigenbasis. The population relaxes to this state geometrically, whereas the coherences decay through a more compound behavior. (ii) In the long time limit, the system approaches a steady state that generally differs from the thermal state of the ancilla. We derive this steady-state solution and show its dependence on the interaction parameters and collision frequency. (iii) We bound the number of interaction steps required to achieve the steady state within a specified error tolerance, and we evaluate the energetic cost associated with the process. Our key finding is that deterministic system-ancilla interactions do not typically result in the system thermalizing to the thermal state of the ancilla. Instead, they generate a distinct nonequilibrium steady state, which we explicitly derive. However, we also identify an operational regime that leads to thermalization with a few long and possibly randomized collisions.</description>

      <title>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</description>

      <title>Innovative Designs and Insights into Quantum Thermal Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation about the operational regions of quantum systems, specifically examining their roles as working media functioning between two thermal reservoirs in Quantum Thermal Machines (QTMs). This study provides relevant and novel insights, including a complete spectrum of QTMs within the operational region of these quantum systems, and introduces new QTM designs never before described in the literature. Additionally, this work introduces a standardized and cohesive classification scheme for QTMs, ensuring robustness in nomenclature and operational distinctions, which enhances both theoretical understanding and practical application. Notably, one of these designs directly addresses the need for a more appropriate explanation of the operation of a laser (or maser) as a QTM. Initial calculations were performed to achieve results applicable to any quantum system subjected to rules analogous to those used in classical thermal machine studies. These results were then used to analyze two-level quantum systems as the working medium of QTMs in the Otton cycle. In particular, we analyzed two specific quantum systems: the laser and a spinless electron in a one-dimensional quantum ring, yielding consistent and innovative results. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the operation and classification of QTMs, establishing a clear and unified framework for their nomenclature while opening new avenues for the design and enhancement of these devices.</description>

Abstract: We show that observables in QED-type theories can be realized in terms of a combinatorial structure called chord diagrams. One advantage of this combinatorial representation is that it simplifies the study of the asymptotic behavior of corresponding Green functions. Particularly, using the new representation, there is no need to use the standard approach of singularity analysis. This relation also reveals the unexplained correlation between the number of Feynman diagrams in Yukawa theory and the diagrams in quenched QED.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.</description>

      <title>How to Minimize the Decoherence Caused by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength. Our studies would offer new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) system based on silicon photonic device. Our DLA system employs guided electromagnetic waves as a primary energy source, modulated to inject into the electron-light interaction region to accelerate or modulate electron beams and recycled the energy for the next round-trip. Long-distance acceleration takes place as electrons interact with the pre-modulated light field. Our loop recycles post-interaction light field, enabling photons reuse across successive cycles. To optimize the interaction process, we developed an adaptive algorithm to refine waveguide structures, and identified an "optimal waveguide accelerator" with superior performance on our dataset. We find that the optimized DLA loop only requires low-power light injection to sufficiently sustain high acceleration gradients for continuous electron beams. Under optimal electron beam intensity, the system achieves exceptionally high photon utilization, ensuring that nearly all injected light power transferred to electrons. Using spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal waveguide also operates as an electron energy filter, selecting and manipulating phase-matched electrons over a broad energy range, even for quantum electron wavefunction shaping. Our photon-recycling DLA setup is not only suitable for low-energy beam accelerators, but also offers versatility as a beam filter or a narrow energy selection combined with other optical elements, the total setup can be further applied to explore free electron quantum optics engaging with the advancing field of photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper, we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Design for light-based spherical aberration correction of ultrafast electron microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that ponderomotive interactions near the electron cross-over can be used for aberration correction in ultrafast electron microscopes. Highly magnified electron shadow images from Si$_3$N$_4$ thin films are utilized to visualize the distortions induced by spherical aberrations. Our simulations of electron-light interactions indicate that spherical aberrations can be compensated resulting in an aberration free angle of \SI{8.1}{mrad}. For achieving the necessary light distribution, we use a gradient descent algorithm to optimize Zernike polynomials and shape the light beam into a modified Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beam.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three such fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rate in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rate in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of electronic structure through periodic electric fields enables the reversible control of effective interactions in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators on ultrafast timescales. A careful analytical examination of the modulated effective interactions is conducted, accurately characterising it through the use of exact summation formulas and Bessel functions. As a result, time reversals are analytically determined in terms of Bessel zeroes. We discuss the half-filled Hubbard model, as well as multi-orbital models, various characteristics of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, and the emergence of chiral spin terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Discord Witness With Uncharacterized Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum discord represents a correlation beyond classicality that could be useful for many quantum information tasks, and therefore is viewed as a valuable quantum resource. Theoretically, whether a bipartite quantum state has a non-zero amount of quantum discord or not can be determined once its density matrix is given. Experimentally, however, it is not easy to perform a reliable tomography on the state, especially when considering the imperfection of devices and the high dimensionality of system. Here, inspired by the so-called dimension witness, we propose a new approach using uncharacterized measurements to witness quantum discord of an unknown bipartite state within arbitrary dimension system. Furthermore, $2 \times 2$ measurements are sufficient for any bipartite state of arbitrarily large dimension. For any two-qubit state, we show that the maximum of witness happens when one performs mutually orthogonal basis measurement on each qubit. Our method exhibits high robustness against device imperfections, such as error tolerance, indicating its experimental feasibility.</description>

Abstract: Simulation of quantum systems is notoriously challenging for classical computers, while quantum hardware is naturally well-suited for this task. However, the imperfections of contemporary quantum systems poses a considerable challenge in carrying out accurate simulations over long evolution times. Here we experimentally demonstrate a method for quantum simulations on a small-scale trapped ions-based quantum simulator. Our method enables quantum simulations of programmable spin-Hamiltonians, using only simple global fields, driving all qubits homogeneously and simultaneously. We measure the evolution of a quantum Ising ring and accurately reconstruct the Hamiltonian parameters, showcasing an accurate and high-fidelity simulation. Our method enables a significant reduction in the required control and depth of quantum simulations, thus generating longer evolution times with higher accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Testing the symmetries of quantum states and channels provides a way to assess their usefulness for different physical, computational, and communication tasks. Here, we establish several complexity-theoretic results that classify the difficulty of symmetry-testing problems involving a unitary representation of a group and a state or a channel that is being tested. In particular, we prove that various such symmetry-testing problems are complete for BQP, QMA, QSZK, QIP(2), QIP_EB(2), and QIP, thus spanning the prominent classes of the quantum interactive proof hierarchy and forging a non-trivial connection between symmetry and quantum computational complexity. Finally, we prove the inclusion of two Hamiltonian symmetry-testing problems in QMA and QAM, while leaving it as an intriguing open question to determine whether these problems are complete for these classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have achieved impressive results in recent years and the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum physics opens new promising avenues to speed up classical learning methods. Rather than viewing classical and quantum approaches as exclusive alternatives, their integration into hybrid designs has gathered increasing interest, as seen in variational quantum algorithms, quantum circuit learning, and kernel methods. Here we introduce deep hybrid classical-quantum reservoir computing for temporal processing of quantum states where information about, for instance, the entanglement or the purity of past input states can be extracted via a single-step measurement. We find that the hybrid setup cascading two reservoirs not only inherits the strengths of both of its constituents but is even more than just the sum of its parts, outperforming comparable non-hybrid alternatives. The quantum layer is within reach of state-of-the-art multimode quantum optical platforms while the classical layer can be implemented in silico.</description>

      <title>Toward a 2D Local Implementation of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric locality is an important theoretical and practical factor for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes which affects code performance and ease of physical realization. For device architectures restricted to 2D local gates, naively implementing the high-rate codes suitable for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing incurs prohibitive overhead. In this work, we present an error correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes bivariate bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.</description>

Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>

Abstract: The realization of effective quantum error correction protocols remains a central challenge in the development of scalable quantum computers. Employing high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) can offer more hardware-efficient protocols than qubit-based approaches. Using electron-nuclear double resonance, we implement a logical qubit encoded on the four states of a I=3/2 nuclear spin hyperfine-coupled to a S=1/2 electron spin qubit; the encoding protects against the dominant decoherence mechanism in such systems, fluctuations of the quantizing magnetic field. We explore the dynamics of the encoded state both under a controlled application of the fluctuation and under natural decoherence processes. Our results confirm the potential of these proposals for practical, implementable, fault tolerant quantum memories.</description>

Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, intimately connected with the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times, is becoming increasingly relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. This quasiprobability distribution can take non-positive values, and its experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Here, we use an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate this scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of work and analyze the behavior of its first and second moments. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, we study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr{\"o}dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.</description>

Abstract: Bell's theorem supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. In this paper we show that all experiments that aim to prove Bell's theorem do not actually achieve this goal. Our conclusions are based on a straightforward statistical analysis of the outcomes of these experiments. The key tool in our study is probability theory and, in particular, the concept of sample space for the dichotomic random variables that quantifies the outcomes of such experiments. We also show that an experimental proof of Bell's theorem is not, in principle, impossible, but it would require a completely different experimental apparatus than those commonly used to allegedly achieve this objective. The main consequence of our work is that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Accurately estimating the overlap between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. While various strategies using distinct quantum measurements have been proposed for overlap estimation, the lack of experimental benchmarks on estimation precision limits strategy selection in different situations. Here we compare the performance of four practical strategies for overlap estimation, including tomography-tomography, tomography-projection, Schur collective measurement and optical swap test using photonic quantum systems. We encode the quantum states on the polarization and path degrees of freedom of single photons. The corresponding measurements are performed by photon detection on certain modes following single-photon mode transformation or two-photon interference. We further propose an adaptive strategy with optimized precision in full-range overlap estimation. Our results shed new light on extracting the parameter of interest from quantum systems, prompting the design of efficient quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two methods for quantum process and detector tomography. In the quantum process tomography method, we develop an analytical procedure for projecting the linear inversion estimation of a quantum channel onto the set of completely positive trace-preserving matrices. By integrating this method with alternate projection techniques, we achieve a three-order-of-magnitude improvement in approximating the closest quantum channel to an arbitrary Hermitian matrix compared to existing methods without compromising computational efficiency. Our second method extends this approach to quantum detector tomography, demonstrating superior efficiency compared to current techniques. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate our protocols across channels of up to four qubits in quantum process tomography and systems of up to six qubits in quantum detector tomography, showcasing superior precision and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Hall effects provide intuitive ways of revealing the topology in crystals, i.e., each quantized "step" represents a distinct topological state. Here, we seek a counterpart for "visualizing" quantum geometry, which is a broader concept. We show how geometry emerges in quantum as an intrinsic consequence of unitary evolution, composing a frame work compatible with quantum metric and independent of specific details or approximations, suggesting quantum geometry may have widespread applicability. Indeed, we exemplify geometric observables, such as oscillation, dephasing, in spin and band scenarios. Anomalies, supported by both analytic and numerical solutions, underscore the advantages of adopting a geometric perspective, potentially yielding distinguishable experimental signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

Abstract: In large-scale quantum networks, quantum repeaters provide an efficient method to distribute entangled states among selected nodes for realizing long-distance and complicated quantum communications. However, extending quantum repeater protocols to high-dimensional quantum states in existing experiments is not easy. Owing to the feasible physical implementations of quantum walks, we proposed various basic modules applicable to quantum repeaters for distributing high-dimensional entangled states via quantum walks, including $d$-dimensional Bell states and multi-particle $d$-dimensional GHZ states. Furthermore, based on the above schemes, we provided a high-dimensional entanglement distribution scheme for arbitrary quantum tree networks. By searching for a Steiner tree in a quantum network, we can achieve high-dimensional entanglement distributions over an arbitrary quantum network. We constructed a quantum fractal network based on $d$-dimensional GHZ states and analyzed the quantum transport properties of continuous quantum walks in the network. Compared with the continuous quantum walk on the Sierpinski gasket, the quantum walk on the new fractal network spreads more widely within the same time frame. Finally, we conducted five experiments to implement various basic modules of 2-party or 3-party entanglement distribution schemes in a superconducting quantum processor. Our study can serve as a building block for constructing large and complex quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: The development of quantum computers has reached a great milestone in spite of restrictions on important quantum resources: the number of qubits being entangled at a single-location quantum computer. The next generation of distributed quantum processors combines single-location quantum computing and quantum networking techniques to permit large entangled qubit groups to be established through remote processors, and quantum algorithms can be executed distributively. We present Disq, as the first formal model of distributed quantum processors, and permit the analysis of distributed quantum programs in the new computation environment. The core of Disq is a distributed quantum programming language that combines the concepts of Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM) and Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with the objective of providing clearly distinguishing quantum concurrent and distributed behaviors. Based on the Disq language, we develop a simulation relation to check the equivalence of a quantum algorithm and its distributed versions so that users can develop the distributed version of a sequential quantum program via a simulation check. We present several case studies, such as quantum addition and Shor's algorithm, to demonstrate their equivalent rewrites to distributed versions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Purpose Architecture for Fast Reset and Protective Readout of Superconducting Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to fast reset a qubit state is crucial for quantum information processing. However, to actively reset a qubit requires engineering a pathway to interact with a dissipative bath, which often comes with the cost of reduced qubit protection from the environment. Here, we present a novel multi-purpose architecture that enables fast reset and protection of superconducting qubits during control and readout. In our design, two on-chip diplexers are connected by two transmission lines. The high-pass branch provides a flat passband for convenient allocation of readout resonators above the qubit frequencies, which is preferred for reducing measurement-induced state transitions. In the low-pass branch, we leverage a standing-wave mode below the maximum qubit frequency for a rapid reset. The qubits are located in the common stopband to inhibit dissipation during coherent operations. We demonstrate resetting a transmon qubit from its first excited state to the ground state in 100 ns, achieving a residual population of 2.7%. The reset time may be further shortened to 27 ns by exploiting the coherent population inversion effect. We further extend the technique to resetting the qubit from its second excited state. Our approach promises scalable implementation of fast reset and qubit protection during control and readout, adding to the toolbox of dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>Private and Robust States for Distributed Quantum Sensing</title>

Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing enables the estimation of multiple parameters encoded in spatially separated probes. While traditional quantum sensing is often focused on estimating a single parameter with maximum precision, distributed quantum sensing seeks to estimate some function of multiple parameters that are only locally accessible for each party involved. In such settings it is natural to not want to give away more information than is necessary. To address this, we use the concept of privacy with respect to a function, ensuring that only information about the target function is available to all the parties, and no other information. We define a measure of privacy (essentially how close we are to this condition being satisfied), and show it satisfies a set of naturally desirable properties of such a measure. Using this privacy measure, we identify and construct entangled resources states that ensure privacy for a given function under different resource distributions and encoding dynamics, characterized by Hamiltonian evolution. For separable and parallel Hamiltonians, we prove that the GHZ state is the only private state for certain linear functions, with the minimum amount of required resources, up to SLOCC. Recognizing the vulnerability of this state to particle loss, we create families of private states, that remain robust even against loss of qubits, by incorporating additional resources. We then extend our findings to different resource distribution scenarios and Hamiltonians, resulting in a comprehensive set of private and robust states for distributed quantum estimation. These results advance the understanding of privacy and robustness in multi-parameter quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. We show that the mathematical assumptions underlying the proof of the CHSH inequality are, in fact, incompatible with the physics of the experiments testing such inequality. This implies that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data yet. However, we also show that an experimental proof of CHSH inequality is, in principle, possible, but it is unclear how to implement, in practice, such an experiment.</description>

      <title>Kerr-magnon-assisted asymptotic stationary photon-phonon squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states in continuous variable systems, which have broad applications in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a photon-phonon squeezing protocol assisted by a Kerr magnon within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. We construct an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for photon-phonon squeezing through strong photon-magnon interaction and modulation over the driving on the photon mode. The effective Hamiltonian can be confirmed by the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian and quantum Langevin equation, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation. Our finding indicates that the asymptotic stationary squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even when the covariance matrix of the system still varies with time. This squeezing level can exceed the maximum value under stable conditions. Moreover, our analysis reveals that a proper Kerr nonlinearity of the magnon can further promote the squeezing generation. Our work provides an extendable framework for generating squeezed states of two Gaussian modes with indirect coupling.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), now offered as QNN-as-a-Service (QNNaaS), have become key targets for model extraction attacks. Existing methods use ensemble learning to train substitute QNNs, but our analysis reveals significant limitations in real-world environments, where noise and cost constraints undermine their effectiveness. In this work, we introduce a novel attack, \textit{split co-teaching}, which uses label variations to \textit{split} queried data by noise sensitivity and employs \textit{co-teaching} schemes to enhance extraction accuracy. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms classical extraction attacks by 6.5\%$\sim$9.5\% and existing QNN extraction methods by 0.1\%$\sim$3.7\% across various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) still struggle with practical-sized data. First, many QGANs use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, which, as our studies reveal, can diminish the QGAN's effectiveness. Second, methods that segment inputs into smaller patches processed by multiple generators face scalability issues. In this work, we propose LSTM-QGAN, a QGAN architecture that eliminates PCA preprocessing and integrates quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to ensure scalable performance. Our experiments show that LSTM-QGAN significantly enhances both performance and scalability over state-of-the-art QGAN models, with visual data improvements, reduced Frechet Inception Distance scores, and reductions of 5x in qubit counts, 5x in single-qubit gates, and 12x in two-qubit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant work has been done to develop quantum satellites, which generate entangled pairs in space and distribute them to ground stations separated some distance away. The reverse uplink case, where pairs are generated on the ground and swapped on the satellite using an optical Bell-measurement, has not been seriously considered due to a prevailing assumption that it is practically infeasible. In this letter, we illustrate the feasibility of performing Discrete Variable photonic Bell-measurements in space by conducting a detailed numerical analysis to estimate the channel efficiency and attainable pair fidelity for various satellite-station configurations. Our model accounts for a wide range of physical effects such as atmospheric effects, stray photons, and mode mismatch. Our findings show promise toward the feasibility of photonic Bell-measurements in space, which motivates future research towards large-scale Satellite-based uplink entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Simple Construction of Qudit Floquet Codes on a Family of Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offer wider possibilities in how one can protect logical quantum information from noise and perform fault-tolerant quantum computation compared to static QECCs. A family of dynamical QECCs called the ``Floquet codes'' consists of a periodic sequence of two-body measurements that enables error-correction on many-body systems, relaxing hardware implementation requirements and improving error-correction reliability. Existing results on Floquet codes has been focused on qubits, two-level quantum systems, with very little attention given on higher dimensional quantum systems, or qudits. We bridge this gap by proposing a simple, yet general construction of qudit Floquet codes based on a simple set of conditions on the sequence two-body measurements defining the code. Moreover, this construction applies to a large family of configurations of qudits on the vertices of a three-colorable lattice which connectivity represented by the edges. We show that this construction includes the existing constructions of both qubit and qudit Floquet codes as special cases. In addition, any qudit Floquet code obtained by our construction achieves a rate of encoded logical qudits over physical qudits approaching $\frac{1}{2}$ as the number of physical qudits in total and on the faces of the lattice grows larger, as opposed to vanishing rate in existing qudit Floquet code constructions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Bivariate Gaussian Potentials on Quantum Walks for Spatial Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum search algorithms are crucial for exploring large solution spaces, but their robustness to environmental perturbations, such as noise or disorder, remains a critical challenge. We examine the impact of biased disorder potentials modeled by a bivariate Gaussian distribution function on the dynamics of quantum walks in spatial search problems. Building on the Ambainis-Kempe-Rivosh (AKR) model for searching on a two-dimensional grid, we incorporate potential fields to investigate how changes in standard deviation and normalization of the bivariate Gaussian function impact the performance of the search algorithm. Our results show that the quantum walk closely mirrors the AKR algorithm when the standard deviation is small but exhibits a rapid decay in success probability as the standard deviation increases. This behavior demonstrates how the bivariate Gaussian can effectively model a noisy oracle within the AKR algorithm. Additionally, we compare the AKR-based model with an alternative quantum walk model using a Hadamard coin and standard shift. These findings contribute to understanding the robustness of quantum walk search algorithms, and provide insights into how quantum walks can be applied to optimization algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Solving linear systems of equations plays a fundamental role in numerous computational problems from different fields of science. The widespread use of numerical methods to solve these systems motivates investigating the feasibility of solving linear systems problems using quantum computers. In this work, we provide a survey of the main advances in quantum linear systems algorithms, together with some applications. We summarize and analyze the main ideas behind some of the algorithms for the quantum linear systems problem in the literature. The analysis begins by examining the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) solver. We note its limitations and reliance on computationally expensive quantum methods, then highlight subsequent research efforts which aimed to address these limitations and optimize runtime efficiency and precision via various paradigms. We focus in particular on the post-HHL enhancements which have paved the way towards optimal lower bounds with respect to error tolerance and condition number. By doing so, we propose a taxonomy that categorizes these studies. Furthermore, by contextualizing these developments within the broader landscape of quantum computing, we explore the foundational work that have inspired and informed their development, as well as subsequent refinements. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of these algorithms in differential equations, quantum machine learning, and many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>Boosting quantum annealing performance through direct polynomial unconstrained binary optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing aims at solving optimization problems of practical relevance using quantum computing hardware. Problems of interest are typically formulated in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonians. However, many optimization problems are much more naturally formulated in terms of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) functions of higher order. As we show with various problem examples, leveraging the PUBO formulation can bring considerable savings in terms of required number of qubits. Moreover, in numerical benchmarks for the paradigmatic 3-SAT problem, we find scenarios where the scaling of the minimal gap during the optimization sweep differs significantly, suggesting the possibility of an exponentially faster annealing time when using the PUBO as compared to the QUBO formulation. This advantage persists even when considering the overhead in implementing the higher-order interactions necessary for PUBO cost Hamiltonians. As an interesting side effect, the analysis on minimum energy gaps of different 3-SAT instance generators reveals different degrees of hardness, which will be of interest also for classical benchmark calculations. Our findings show a promising path to improving the resource efficiency and sweeping speed of quantum annealing, important prerequisites when aiming at solving larger optimization problems with relevance to industry.</description>

      <title>Families of $d=2$ 2D subsystem stabilizer codes for universal Hamiltonian quantum computation with two-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of fault tolerant quantum error correction for analog, Hamiltonian quantum computation, error suppression via energy penalties is an effective alternative. We construct families of distance-$2$ stabilizer subsystem codes we call ``trapezoid codes'', that are tailored for energy-penalty schemes. We identify a family of codes achieving the maximum code rate, and by slightly relaxing this constraint, uncover a broader range of codes with enhanced physical locality, thus increasing their practical applicability. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to map the required qubit connectivity graph into graphs compatible with the locality constraints of quantum hardware. Finally, we provide a systematic framework to evaluate the performance of these codes in terms of code rate, physical locality, graph properties, and penalty gap, enabling an informed selection of error-suppression codes for specific quantum computing applications. We identify the $[[4k+2,2k,g,2]]$ family of subsystem codes as optimal in terms of code rate and penalty gap scaling.</description>

      <title>Observation as Physication. A single-world unitary no-conspiracy interpretation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical meaning of the operators is not reducible to the intrinsic relations of the quantum system, since unitary transformations can find other operators satisfying the exact same relations. The physical meaning is determined empirically. I propose that the assignment of physical meaning to operators spreads through observation, along with the values of the observables, from the already observed degrees of freedom to the newly observed ones. I call this process "physication". I propose that quantum observations are nothing more than this assignment, which can be done unitarily. This approach doesn't require collapse, many-worlds, or a conspiratorial fine tuning of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherent State Transform on Continuous-Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems are believed to be more efficient for quantum sensing and metrology than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts due to the infinite spectrum of their native operators, our toolkit of manipulating CV systems is still limited. We introduce the quantum coherent state transform~(QCST) and a framework for implementing it in CV quantum systems with two ancilla CV states and six two-mode SUM gates. Measurement of the resulting quantum state under the momentum eigenbasis is equivalent to a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) with elements $\left\{\frac{1}{\pi} \left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle\alpha\right| \right\}_{\alpha \in \mathbb{C}}$ , which provides an efficient way to learn the original CV state. Our protocol makes it possible to estimate the coherent state parameter within minimum-uncertainty precision using a single copy of the state, which finds applications in single-shot gate calibration of beam splitter and rotation gates to arbitrary precision. With repeated runs of our protocol, one can also estimate the parameters of any Gaussian state, which helps to calibrate other Gaussian gates, such as squeezing. For non-Gaussian states, our protocols can be used to perform Husimi Q-function tomography efficiently. With DV systems as ancilla instead, we can realize QCST approximately, which can be used to transfer CV states to DV states and back. The simplicity and broad applicability of the quantum coherent state transform make it an essential tool in continuous-variable quantum information science and engineering.</description>

      <title>The optimization of exact multi-target quantum search algorithm based on MindSpore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grover's search algorithm has attracted great attention due to its quadratic speedup over classical algorithms in unsorted database search problems. However, Grover's algorithm is inefficient in multi-target search problems, except in the case of 1/4 of the data in the database satisfying the search conditions. Long presented a modified version of Grover's search algorithm by introducing a phase-matching condition that can search for the target state with a zero theoretical failure rate. In this work, we present an optimized exact multi-target search algorithm based on the modified Grover's algorithm by transforming the canonical diffusion operator to a more efficient diffusion operator, which can solve the multi-target search problem with a 100% success rate while requiring fewer gate counts and shallower circuit depth. After that, the optimized multi-target algorithm for four different items, including 2-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 4 targets, and 6-qubit with 3 targets, are implemented on MindSpore framework. The experimental results show that, compared with Grover's algorithm and the modified Grover's algorithm, the proposed algorithm can reduce the quantum gate count by at least 21.1% and the depth of the quantum circuit by at least 11.4% and maintain a 100% success probability. Our code are available at https://github.com/mindsporelab/models/tree/master/research/arxiv_papers/GROVER-OP. Thanks for the support provided by MindSpore Community.</description>

      <title>Traversing Quantum Control Robustness Landscapes: A New Paradigm for Quantum Gate Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization of robust quantum control is often tailored to specific tasks and suffers from inefficiencies due to the complexity of cost functions. Our recent findings indicate a highly effective methodology for the engineering of quantum gates by initiating the process with a robust control configuration of any arbitrary gate. We first introduce the Quantum Control Robustness Landscape (QCRL), a conceptual framework that maps control parameters to noise susceptibility. This framework facilitates a systematic investigation of equally robust controls for diverse quantum operations. By navigating through the level sets of the QCRL, our Robustness-Invariant Pulse Variation (RIPV) algorithm allows for the variation of control pulses while preserving robustness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our single- and two-qubit gates exceed the quantum error correction threshold even with substantial noise. This methodology opens up a new paradigm for quantum gate engineering capable of effectively suppressing generic noise.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evaluation of Optical Quantum Modules via Two-Photon High-Dimensional Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum information technology has increased the demand for precise testing and calibration of quantum modules, especially in optical quantum circuits where module reliability directly impacts system performance. To address this need, we propose a two-photon quantum module evaluation method based on high-dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Our method uses multi-degree-of-freedom photon encoding to enable rapid and accurate evaluation of optical quantum modules. Compared to traditional methods such as quantum process tomography and direct fidelity estimation, our method not only simplifies implementation but also significantly minimizes the measurement resources required. Notably, the resource demands remain invariant as the system dimensionality scales, ensuring efficient evaluation even in high-dimensional quantum systems. We validated this method on a programmable silicon photonic chip, demonstrating its ability to accurately evaluate optical quantum module performance while significantly reducing resource consumption. This quantum module evaluation method holds promise for broader applications in the field of optical quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Atom-by-Atom Assembly of Defect-Free Two-Dimensional Mixed-Species Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defect-free single atom array in optical tweezers is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.083202}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083202(2022)}}], the filling fractions were limited by the imperfect transfer of atoms and the occurrence of logjams during the atom rearrangement. In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Reconstruction with Structured Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r&lt;2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.</description>

Abstract: Two-parameter generalizations of depolarizing channels are introduced and studied. These so-called Cartan-covariant channels have a covariance Lie group that forms a Cartan decomposition of SU$(D)$. The regions of completely positive and completely co-positive Cartan-covariant trace-preserving maps are found through a spectral analysis of the Choi state. Furthermore, we prove that the PPT$^{2}$ conjecture holds for these channels in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between 0 mT and 50 mT. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network quantum states are powerful tools for strongly correlated systems, tailored to capture local correlations such as in ground states with entanglement area laws. When applying tensor network states to interacting fermionic systems, a proper choice of the basis or orbitals can reduce the bond dimension of tensors and provide physically relevant orbitals. We introduce such a change of basis with unitary gates obtained from compressing fermionic Gaussian states into quantum circuits corresponding to various tensor networks. These circuits can reduce the ground state entanglement entropy and improve the performance of algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group. We study the Anderson impurity model with one and two impurities to show the potential of the method for improving computational efficiency and interpreting impurity physics. Furthermore, fermionic Gaussian circuits can also suppress entanglement during the time evolution out of low-energy state. Last, we consider Gaussian multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (GMERA) circuits which compress fermionic Gaussian states hierarchically. The emergent coarse-grained physical models from these GMERA circuits are studied in terms of their entanglement properties and suitability for performing time evolution.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the long-standing question of representing (totally) anti-symmetric functions in high dimensions. We propose a new ansatz based on the composition of an odd function with a fixed set of anti-symmetric basis functions. We prove that this ansatz can exactly represent every anti-symmetric and continuous function and the number of basis functions has efficient scaling with respect to dimension (number of particles). The singular locus of the anti-symmetric basis functions is precisely identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of dipolar interactions within ultracold molecular ensembles represents a pivotal advancement in experimental physics, aiming at the emulation of quantum phenomena unattainable through mere contact interactions. Our study uncovers regimes of multiband occupation which allow to probe more realistic, complex long-range interacting lattice models with ultracold dipolar simulators. By mapping out experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we calculate the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and a target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multiband lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. Our findings reveal that for shallow lattices and stronger interactions above half filling, multiband population increases, resulting in fundamentally different ground states than the ones observed in simple lowest-band descriptions, e.g. striped vs checkerboard states. A wide range of probed parameter regimes in its turn provides a systematic and quantitative blueprint for realizing multiband states with two-dimensional quantum simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules.</description>

Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously challenging to build and test, especially for cryptographic applications. While statistical tests cannot definitively guarantee an RNG's output quality, they are a powerful verification tool and the only universally applicable testing method. In this work, we design, implement, and present various post-processing methods, using randomness extractors, to improve the RNG output quality and compare them through statistical testing. We begin by performing intensive tests on three RNGs -- the 32-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR), Intel's 'RDSEED,' and IDQuantique's 'Quantis' -- and compare their performance. Next, we apply the different post-processing methods to each RNG and conduct further intensive testing on the processed output. To facilitate this, we introduce a comprehensive statistical testing environment, based on existing test suites, that can be parametrised for lightweight (fast) to intensive testing.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 microseconds single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, and its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems have not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith, as well as each individual reflection and transmission time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with scattering singularities such as coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each time-delay quantity are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, number of scattering channels $M$, Dyson symmetry class $\beta$, and uniform attenuation $\eta$. The tails determine the abundance of the singularities in generic scattering systems, and the superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established statistics of unitary systems, where the distribution tail depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. We relate the statistics to the topological properties of the corresponding singularities. Although the results presented here are based on classical microwave experiments, they are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as optical or acoustic resonators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to the changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the analogue of the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within the classical limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Manipulating spectral transitions and photonic transmission in a non-Hermitian optical system through nanoparticle perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14862</link>

Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this work, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we show that by precisely controlling the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues (or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>
