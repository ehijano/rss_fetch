      <title>Operators on complemented lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper deals with complemented lattices where, however, a unary operation of complementation is not explicitly assumed. This means that an element can have several complements. The mapping $^+$ assigning to each element $a$ the set $a^+$ of all its complements is investigated as an operator on the given lattice. We can extend the definition of $a^+$ in a natural way from elements to arbitrary subsets. In particular we study the set $a^+$ for complemented modular lattices, and we characterize when the set $a^{++}$ is a singleton. By means of the operator $^+$ we introduce two other operators $\to$ and $\odot$ which can be considered as implication and conjunction in a certain propositional calculus, respectively. These two logical connectives are ``unsharp'' which means that they assign to each pair of elements a non-empty subset. However, also these two derived operators share a lot of properties with the corresponding logical connectives in intuitionistic logic or in the logic of quantum mechanics. In particular, they form an adjoint pair. Finally, we define so-called deductive systems and we show their relationship to the mentioned operators as well as to lattice filters.</description>

      <title>A characterization of Continuous Logic by using quantale-valued logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalization of Continuous Logic ([BBHU08]) where the distances take values in suitable co-quantales (in the way as it was proposed in [Fla97]). By assuming suitable conditions (e.g., being co-divisible, co-Girard and a V-domain), we provide, as test questions, a proof of a version of the Tarski-Vaught test (Proposition 4.2) and {\L}o\'s Theorem (Theorem 5.27) in our setting. Iovino proved in [Iov01] that there is no any logic extending (equivalent logics to) Continuous Logic satisfying both Countable Tarski-Vaught chain Theorem and Compactness Theorem. Since [0, 1] satisfies all of the assumptions given above, we get new logics by dropping any of those assumptions.</description>

      <title>Epimorphisms between finitely generated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasivariety has the weak ES property when the epimorphisms between its finitely generated members are surjective. A characterization of quasivarieties with the weak ES property is obtained and a method for detecting failures of this property in quasivarieties with a near unanimity term and in congruence permutable varieties is given. It is also shown that under reasonable assumptions the weak ES property implies arithmeticity. In particular, every filtral variety with the weak ES property is a discriminator variety.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory and Elementary Submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \emph{Approximation Theory} uses nicely-behaved subcategories to understand entire categories, just as projective modules are used to approximate arbitrary modules in classical homological algebra. We use set-theoretic \emph{elementary submodel arguments} to give new, short proofs of well-known theorems in approximation theory, sometimes with stronger results.</description>

      <title>Nelson's Logical Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As is now well known, the generalization of the square of opposition to a hexagon was discovered independently by three philosophers in the early 1950s: Paul Jacoby, Augustin Sesmat, and Robert Blanch\'{e} . Much less well known is the earlier use of similar diagrams by the German philosopher Leonard Nelson (1882-1927). This paper explores the significance of Nelson's work for the history of the JSB hexagon and for logical geometry more widely.</description>
