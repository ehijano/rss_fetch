      <title>Koba-Nielsen local zeta functions, convex subsets, and generalized Selberg-Mehta-Macdonald and Dotsenko-Fateev-like integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koba-Nielsen local zeta functions are integrals depending on several complex parameters, used to regularize the Koba-Nielsen string amplitudes. These integrals are convergent and admit meromorphic continuations in the complex parameters. In the original case, the integration is carried out on the n-dimensional Euclidean space. In this work, the integration is over a variety of (bounded or unbounded) convex subsets; the resulting integrals also admit meromorphic continuations in the complex parameters. We describe the meromorphic continuation's polar locus explicitly, using the technique of embedded resolution. This result can be reinterpreted as saying that the meromorphic continuations are weighted sums of Gamma functions, evaluated at linear combinations of the complex parameters, where the weights are holomorphic functions. The integrals announced in the title of this paper occur as a particular case of these new Koba-Nielsen local zeta functions, or of a further generalization to arbitrary hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Reshetikhin-Turaev construction and $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show that the $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons partition functions are related to Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. In this abelian context, it turns out that the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction that yields these invariants relies on a ``twisted" category rather than a modular one. Furthermore, the Chern-Simons duality of the $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ partition functions straightforwardly extend to the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.</description>

      <title>Shape and Spectrum: On the Heat and Volume of Self-Similar Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the relationship between geometry and spectrum of regions with fractal boundary. The relationship is well-understood for fractal harps in one dimension, but largely open for fractal drums in larger dimensions. To that end, we study fractals arising as attractors of self-similar iterated function systems with some separation conditions. On the geometric side, we analyze the tube zeta functions and their poles, called complex dimensions, which govern the asymptotics of the volume of tubular neighborhoods of such fractals. On the spectral side, we study a Dirichlet problem for the heat equation, closely related to spectrum of the Laplacian. We show that the asymptotics of the total heat content are controlled by the same set of possible complex dimensions. Our method is to establish scaling functional equations and to solve by means of truncated Mellin transforms, wherefrom the scaling ratios of the underlying dynamics can be seen to govern both the geometry and spectra of these self-similar fractal drums.</description>

      <title>Free phases of Majorana fermions: Tenfold ways compared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of neutral free fermions. Our approach utilizes Karoubi triples with negative squares, thought of as polarizations. We prove that neutral free fermion SPT phases protected by a symmetry algebra $A$ are classified by the real $K$-theory group $K_2(A^{op})$, and demonstrate how our classification reproduces known results in the presence of charge. Our formalism also allows for symmetries described by groups, potentially with time-reversal, using the formalism of fermionic groups and their fermionic group $C^*$-algebras. Our classification extends to positive spatial dimensions and includes weak phases using the crystalline equivalence principle. Our approach clarifies and unifies various existing tenfold way classifications by establishing their equivalence through Morita equivalences of symmetry algebras. We expect our classification to be the natural domain for the free-to-interacting map proposed by Freed and Hopkins.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Hill's equation parameters and application to cosmic reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation provides a compelling framework for explaining several observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields, and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.</description>

      <title>Topological network analysis using a programmable photonic quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08157v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding topological features in networks is crucial for unravelling complex phenomena across fields such as neuroscience, condensed matter, and high-energy physics. However, identifying higher-order topological structures -- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks -- remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.</description>

      <title>Poisson Statistics for Coulomb Gases at Intermediate Temperature Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the microscopic statistics of a Coulomb gas in $\mathbb{R}^2$ at intermediate temperatures. In particular, we show that the microscopic point process associated to the Coulomb gas converges to a homogeneous Poisson point process at intermediate temperature regimes $\beta N \rightarrow \infty$ and $\beta N \log N \rightarrow 0$, extending previous results. Our approach relies on a novel quantitative asymptotic description of correlation functions, which is of its own interest.</description>

      <title>Data Generation without Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be leveraged to develop novel generative methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta$-interactions supported on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the approximation of a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a singular $\delta$-potential that is formally given by $(i \nabla + A)^2 + Q + \alpha \delta_\Sigma$ by Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials in the norm resolvent sense. This is done for $\Sigma$ being the finite union of $C^2$-hypersurfaces, for coefficients $A$, $Q$, and $\alpha$ under minimal assumptions such that the associated quadratic forms are closed and sectorial, and $Q$ and $\alpha$ are allowed to be complex-valued functions. In particular, $\Sigma$ can be a graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the boundary of a piecewise $C^2$-domain. Moreover, spectral implications of the mentioned convergence result are discussed.</description>

      <title>Complexity of mixed Schatten norms of quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of computing the mixed Schatten $\|\Phi\|_{q\to p}$ norms of linear maps $\Phi$ between matrix spaces. When $\Phi$ is completely positive, we show that $\| \Phi \|_{q \to p}$ can be computed efficiently when $q \geq p$. The regime $q \geq p$ is known as the non-hypercontractive regime and is also known to be easy for the mixed vector norms $\ell_{q} \to \ell_{p}$ [Boyd, 1974]. However, even for entanglement-breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps $\Phi$, we show that computing $\| \Phi \|_{1 \to p}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when $p&gt;1$. Moving beyond the completely-positive case and considering $\Phi$ to be difference of entanglement breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps, we prove that computing $\| \Phi \|^+_{1 \to 1}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. In contrast, for the completely-bounded (cb) case, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute $\|\Phi\|_{cb,1\to p}$ and $\|\Phi\|^+_{cb,1\to p}$ for any linear map $\Phi$ and $p\geq1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real left-invariant spin Gaussian fields on $SO(3)$, a special class of non-isotropic random fields used to model the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Leveraging recent results from "New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes" (arXiv:2505.22350), we provide an explicit formula for the Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition of the area measure of level sets of such random fields. Our analysis represents a step forward in the study of second-order asymptotic properties of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures of excursion sets of spin random fields. Remarkably, our formulas reveal a clear difference between the high frequency regime and the zero spin case.</description>

      <title>Domino Tilings of the Aztec Diamond in Random Environment and Schur Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of size $M$ in a random environment, where the environment is a one-periodic sequence of i.i.d. random weights attached to domino positions (i.e., to the edges of the underlying portion of the square grid). We consider two cases: either the variance of the weights decreases at a critical scale $1/M$, or the distribution of the weights is fixed. In the former case, the unrescaled fluctuations of the domino height function are governed by the sum of a Gaussian Free Field and an independent Brownian motion. In the latter case, we establish fluctuations on the much larger scale $\sqrt M$, given by the Brownian motion alone.
  To access asymptotic fluctuations in random environment, we employ the method of Schur generating functions. Moreover, we substantially extend the known Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems for particle systems via Schur generating functions in order to apply them to our setting. These results might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study a fuzzy variant of the inhomogeneous Landau equation and establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions for moderately soft potentials. The spatial delocalization introduced in the collision operator not only enhances regularity and prevents singularity formation, but also reveals additional structural properties of the model. In particular, we show that several forms of the Fisher information decay monotonically or remain uniformly bounded in time.</description>

      <title>Exponentially fast selection of sectors for quantum trajectories beyond non demolition measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in long time, quantum trajectories select an invariant subspace of the Hilbert space of the system being indirectly measured. This selection is shown to be exponentially fast in an almost sure sense and in average. This result generalizes a known result for non demolition measurements to arbitrary repeated indirect measurements. Our proofs are based on the introduction of a deformation of the original instrument to an equivalent one with a unique invariant state.</description>

      <title>Gaussian pseudo-Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>

      <title>The Cyclic and Modular Microcosm Principle in Quantum Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monoidal categories with additional structure such as a braiding or some form of duality abound in quantum topology. They often appear in tandem with Frobenius algebras inside them. Motivations for this range from the theory of module categories to the construction of correlators in conformal field theory. We generalize the Baez-Dolan microcosm principle to consistently describe all these types of algebras by extending it to cyclic and modular algebras in the sense of Getzler-Kapranov. Our main result links the microcosm principle for cyclic algebras to the one for modular algebras via Costello's modular envelope. The result can be understood as a local-to-global construction or an integration procedure for various flavors of Frobenius algebras that substantially generalizes and unifies the available (and often intrinsically semisimple) methods using for example triangulations or classical skein theory. As the main application of this rather abstract result, we solve the problem of classifying consistent systems of correlators for open conformal field theories and show that the genus zero correlators for logarithmic conformal field theories constructed by Fuchs-Schweigert can be uniquely extended to handlebodies. This establishes a very general correspondence between full genus zero conformal field theory in dimension two and skein theory in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

Abstract: For general large non-Hermitian random matrices $X$ and deterministic normal deformations $A$, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics of $A+X$ close to the critical edge points of its spectrum are universal. This concludes the proof of the third and last remaining typical universality class for non-Hermitian random matrices, after bulk and sharp edge universalities have been established in recent years.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the stability conditions for the well-posedness of the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of conducting perfect fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. Due to the counterexamples constructed by C. Hao and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286], the plasma-vacuum problems violating the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition and without surface tension are believed to be highly unstable or even ill-posed. However, based on a geometric perspective, we demonstrate that, although the initial data provided therein are ill-posed in the Lagrangian framework characterizing the regularity of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with such initial data can still be stable/well-posed in the Eulerian setting without involving flow maps, under the hypothesis that the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. This discloses the essential difference of the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks of MHD free boundary problems and the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. Moreover, we also consider the consider the surface tension effect and establish the local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces in this case. Furthermore, under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure, we prove vanishing surface tension limits. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, and the stabilizing effect of surface tension is stronger than that of the tangential magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M. Buchstaber and S.I. Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M. Buchstaber, O.V. Karpov and S.I. Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V. Klimenko and O.L. Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>
