      <title>Dawn of a nuclear clock: frequency ratio of the $^{229m}$Th isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Limitation of single-repumping schemes for laser cooling of Sr atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the efficacy of two single-repumping schemes, $5s5p \,{}^3P_2 - 5p^2 \,{}^3P_2$ ($481\,\mathrm{nm}$) and $5s5p \,{}^3P_2 - 5s5d \,{}^3D_2$ ($497\,\mathrm{nm}$), for a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of Sr atoms. We reveal that the enhancement in the MOT lifetime is limited to $26.9(2)$ for any single-repumping scheme. Our investigation indicates that the primary decay path from the $5s5p \,{}^1P_1$ state to the $5s5p \,{}^3P_0$ state proceeds via the $5s4d \,{}^3D_1$ state, rather than through the upper states accessed by the single-repumping lasers. We estimate that the branching ratio for the $5s5p \,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d \,{}^3D_1 \to 5s5p \,{}^3P_0$ decay path is $1:3.9 \times 10^6$ and the decay rate for the transition from the $5s5p \,{}^1P_1$ state to the $5s4d \,{}^3D_1$ state is $83(32)\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This outcome underscores the limitation on atom number in the MOT for long loading times ($\gtrsim 1 \,\mathrm{s}$) when employing a single-repumping scheme. These findings will contribute to the construction of field-deployable optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory for Optical Cooling of a Trapped Atom with Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin-relaxation optimization for miniaturized optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microfabrication of cesium vapor cells for optically pumped magnetometry relies on optimisation of buffer gas pressure in order to maximise atomic coherence time and sensitivity to external magnetic signals. We demonstrate post-bond nitrogen buffer gas pressure tuning through localized heating of an integrated micro-pill dispenser. We characterize the variation in the intrinsic longitudinal relaxation rate, $\gamma_{10}$, and magnetic sensitivity, as a function of the resulting nitrogen buffer gas pressure. Measurements are conducted through employing an optically pumped magnetometer operating in a free-induction-decay configuration. $\gamma_{10}$ is extracted across a range of nitrogen pressures between $\sim$60-700Torr, measuring a minimum of 140Hz at 115Torr. Additionally, we achieve sensitivities as low as 130fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a bias field amplitude of $\sim 50${\mu}$T. With the optimal nitrogen buffer gas pressure now quantified and achievable post-fabrication, these mass-producible cells can be tailored to suit a variety of sensing applications, ensuring peak magnetometer performance.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optical spectroscopy of Rydberg excitons in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the microwaves was studied using optical absorption specstroscopy, and via the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory was constructed to explore the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strength, from $43.5\pm 0.3$ V m$^{-1}$ up to $688 \pm 5$ V m$^{-1}$, crossing from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative width of Rydberg exctions leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absoprtion continuum without ionization.</description>

      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

      <title>Average-atom approach for transport properties of shocked argon in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present electron transport calculations of shocked argon based on an average-atom modeling of the plasma, and compare them with measurements, involving both incident and reflected shock waves. Since the corresponding experiments are subject to a 5 T magnetic field, the impact of the latter on the Rankine-Hugoniot equations is taken into account, starting from the magneto-resistive hydrodynamics, and the resistivity tensor is deduced from the Boltzmann equation. The resistivity tensor yields the electrical and Hall resistivities. Our average-atom code Paradisio provides the quantities required for the calculation of electrical resistivity within the Ziman-Evans formalism, as well as for the Hall resistivity. We obtain a good agreement between calculated conductivities and experimental values, both for the incident and reflected shocks. Our values of the Hall constant are compared to experimental values derived from Hall voltage measurements, as well as to theoretical ones based on the quantum statistical linear-relaxation-time approach.</description>

      <title>CoOMBE: A suite of open-source programs for the integration of the optical Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>

      <title>Dressed-State Spectroscopy and Magic Trapping of Microwave-Shielded NaCs Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the optical polarizability of microwave-shielded ultracold NaCs molecules in an optical dipole trap. While dressing a pair of rotational states with a microwave field, we observe a marked dependence of the optical polarizability on the intensity and detuning of the dressing field. To precisely characterize differential energy shifts between dressed rotational states, we establish dressed-state spectroscopy. For strong dressing fields, we find that a magic rotational transition can be engineered and demonstrate its insensitivity to laser intensity fluctuations. The results of this work have direct relevance for evaporative cooling and the recent demonstration of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates [Bigagli, et al., Nature (2024)] and may open a door to precision microwave spectroscopy in interacting many-body systems of microwave-shielded molecules.</description>

      <title>Utility of virtual qubits in trapped-ion quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose encoding multiple qubits inside ions in existing trapped-ion quantum computers to access more qubits and to simplify circuits implementing standard algorithms. By using such `virtual' qubits, some inter-ion gates can be replaced by intra-ion gates, reducing the use of vibrational modes of the ion chain, leading to less noise. We discuss specific examples such as the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and random circuit sampling, using a small number of virtual qubits. Additionally, virtual qubits enable using larger number of data qubits for an error correcting code, and we consider the repetition code as an example. We also lay out practical considerations to be made when choosing states to encode virtual qubits in $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ ions, and for preparing states and performing measurements.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>
