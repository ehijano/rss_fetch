      <title>Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Progressive Uncertainty-Guided Evidential U-KAN for Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Evidence-U-KAN-BBE8}{github}.</description>

      <title>FS-RWKV: Leveraging Frequency Spatial-Aware RWKV for 3T-to-7T MRI Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead. RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1) Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>SAM2-3dMed: Empowering SAM2 for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Rewiring Development in Brain Segmentation: Leveraging Adult Brain Priors for Enhancing Infant MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects, motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work, we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point. Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer. By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.</description>

      <title>MIP-Based Tumor Segmentation: A Radiologist-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PET/CT imaging is the gold standard for tumor detection, offering high accuracy in identifying local and metastatic lesions. Radiologists often begin assessment with rotational Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) from PET, confirming findings with volumetric slices. This workflow is time-consuming, especially in metastatic cases. Despite their clinical utility, MIPs are underutilized in automated tumor segmentation, where 3D volumetric data remains the norm. We propose an alternative approach that trains segmentation models directly on MIPs, bypassing the need to segment 3D volumes and then project. This better aligns the model with its target domain and yields substantial gains in computational efficiency and training time. We also introduce a novel occlusion correction method that restores MIP annotations occluded by high-intensity structures, improving segmentation. Using the autoPET 2022 Grand Challenge dataset, we evaluate our method against standard 3D pipelines in terms of performance and training/computation efficiency for segmentation and classification, and analyze how MIP count affects segmentation. Our MIP-based approach achieves segmentation performance on par with 3D (&lt;=1% Dice difference, 26.7% better Hausdorff Distance), while reducing training time (convergence time) by 55.8-75.8%, energy per epoch by 71.7-76%, and TFLOPs by two orders of magnitude, highlighting its scalability for clinical use. For classification, using 16 MIPs only as input, we surpass 3D performance while reducing training time by over 10x and energy consumption per epoch by 93.35%. Our analysis of the impact of MIP count on segmentation identified 48 views as optimal, offering the best trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Biophysically-Conditioned Generative Framework for 3D Brain Tumor MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: https://github.com/valentin-biller/ldm.git</description>

      <title>3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.</description>

      <title>Foraging with the Eyes: Dynamics in Human Visual Gaze and Deep Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study, we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</description>

      <title>Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>EMedNeXt: An Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Framework for Sub-Saharan Africa using MedNeXt V2 with Deep Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge. Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset, and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble framework combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 62.7% (CC), 83.2% (ED), 72.9% (ET), 85.7% (NET), 91.8% (TC), and 92.6% (WT) on the unseen test dataset, respectively. Our proposed method achieves first place (rank 1st) in the BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge.</description>

      <title>Content-Adaptive Inference for State-of-the-art Learned Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the BD-rate performance of recent learned video codec models in both low-delay and random-access modes exceed that of respective modes of traditional codecs on average over common benchmarks, the performance improvements for individual videos with complex/large motions is much smaller compared to scenes with simple motion. This is related to the inability of a learned encoder model to generalize to motion vector ranges that have not been seen in the training set, which causes loss of performance in both coding of flow fields as well as frame prediction and coding. As a remedy, we propose a generic (model-agnostic) framework to control the scale of motion vectors in a scene during inference (encoding) to approximately match the range of motion vectors in the test and training videos by adaptively downsampling frames. This results in down-scaled motion vectors enabling: i) better flow estimation; hence, frame prediction and ii) more efficient flow compression. We show that the proposed framework for content-adaptive inference improves the BD-rate performance of already state-of-the-art low-delay video codec DCVC-FM by up to 41\% on individual videos without any model fine tuning. We present ablation studies to show measures of motion and scene complexity can be used to predict the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>SQ-GAN: Semantic Image Communications Using Masked Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Semantically Masked Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (SQ-GAN), a novel approach integrating semantically driven image coding and vector quantization to optimize image compression for semantic/task-oriented communications. The method only acts on source coding and is fully compliant with legacy systems. The semantics is extracted from the image computing its semantic segmentation map using off-the-shelf software. A new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) selectively encodes semantically relevant features of the image. The relevance of the different semantic classes is task-specific, and it is incorporated in the training phase by introducing appropriate weights in the loss function. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000, BPG, and deep-learning based methods across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the reconstructed image, at extremely low compression rates.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems with FLAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key obstacles: (i) the data likelihood term is usually intractable; (ii) learned generative models cannot be directly conditioned on the distorted observations, leading to conflicting objectives between data likelihood and prior; and (iii) the reconstructions can deviate from the observed data. We present FLAIR, a novel, training-free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it with deterministic trajectory adjustments to guide the prior towards regions which are more likely under the posterior. To enforce exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

      <title>DiffMark: Diffusion-based Robust Watermark Against Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.</description>

      <title>MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.</description>
