      <title>Exploring the world of rhamnolipids: A critical review of their production, interfacial properties, and potential application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhamnolipids are very promising sugar-based biosurfactants, generally produced by bacteria, with a wide range of properties that can be exploited at an industrial and technological level, e.g. in cosmetics, food science, or oil recovery, to provide benefits for human health and the environment. This has led to intensive research into optimizing their production to increase yields and minimize costs, which is challenging because biotechnological methods for rhamnolipid production result in complex product mixtures and require the introduction of complex separation strategies to ensure the purity of the rhamnolipid obtained. This is an important issue for the introduction of rhamnolipids to the market due to the differences that exist between the properties of the different congeners. This review attempts to provide an overview of the interfacial properties, potential applications, and recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the adsorption to interfaces and assembly in solution of rhamnolipids. In addition, the review also discusses some general aspects related to the production and purification methods of rhamnolipids, highlighting the need for further research to fully exploit their potential. It is hoped that this review will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about rhamnolipids and stimulate further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Spiral folding of a flexible chain of chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a flexible polymer chain made up of chiral active Brownian particles in two dimensions using computer simulations. In the presence of chiral active Brownian forces, the radius of gyration of the chain reduces significantly. We further identify the formation of spirals using the tangent-tangent correlation to characterize the internal structure of the chain. The polymer chain forms a pair of spirals with opposite spiral turns on both ends of the polymer. We compute the number of turns of both spirals, and find that the total number of turns increases with angular frequency as well as P{\'e}clet number. However, the spirals become weak and the number of turns decreases at a very high P{\'e}clet number. We draw a phase diagram using the turn number. The end-to-end correlation displays oscillatory behavior, which signifies the rotational dynamics of the chain. We quantify the rotation frequency from the end-to-end vector, which follows a power law behavior with exponent $3/2$. We also provide a scaling relation between the radius of gyration and the chain length, and the exponent decreases significantly in the presence of chiral active forces.</description>

      <title>Twist deformation of physical trefoil knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knots across various length scales, from micro to macro-scales, such as polymers, DNA, shoelaces, and surgery, serving their unique mechanical properties. The shape of ideal knots has been extensively studied in the context of knot theory, while that of physical knots has been discussed very recently. The complex interplay of elasticity and geometry, such as bending, twisting, and contact, needs to be disentangled to predict their deformation. Still, the unified understanding of the deformation of physical knots is insufficient. Here, we focus on the trefoil knot, a closed knot with a nontrivial topology, and study the relationship between the shapes of the trefoil knot and applied physical twists, combining experiments and simulations. As we twist the elastomeric rod, the knot becomes either tightened or loosened, preserving the original three-fold symmetry, and then buckles and exhibits symmetry breaking at critical angles. The curvature profiles computed through the X-ray tomography analysis also exhibit similar symmetry breaking. The transition would be triggered by the mechanical instability, where the imposed twist energy is converted into the bending energy. The phase transition observed here is analogous to the classical buckling phenomena of elastic rings known as the Michell instability. We find that the twist buckling instability of the trefoil knot results from the interplay of bending, twisting, and contact properties of the rod. In other words, the buckling of the knot is predictable based on the elasticity and geometry of rods, which would be useful in avoiding or even utilizing their buckling in practical engineering applications such as surgery and the shipping industry.</description>

      <title>Elastic Pseudoturbulence in Polymer Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of polymer additives on pseudoturbulence induced by a swarm of bubbles rising in a quiescent fluid. We find that, beyond a critical polymer concentration, the energy spectra of velocity fluctuations in bubble-induced turbulence decay more steeply with respect to the wavenumber $k$. This new scaling is significantly steeper than the classical $k^{-3}$ scaling observed for bubbles in Newtonian fluids; it is independent of the gas volume fraction in the inertial limit and occurs within the length scales between the bubble wake length and the bubble diameter. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the presence of polymers enhances the coherence of the flow, highlighting the significant role of polymer additives in modifying the characteristics of pseudoturbulence.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of a cold tracer in a hot bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.</description>

      <title>Modelling the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of brain tissue in torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain tissue accommodates non-linear deformations and exhibits time-dependent mechanical behaviour. The latter is one of the most pronounced features of brain tissue, manifesting itself primarily through viscoelastic effects such as stress relaxation. To investigate its viscoelastic behaviour, we performed ramp-and-hold relaxation tests in torsion on freshly slaughtered cylindrical ovine brain samples ($25\,\,\text{mm}$ diameter and $\sim 10\,\,\text{mm}$ height). The tests were conducted using a commercial rheometer at varying twist rates of $\{40,240,400\}\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}\,\,\text{s}^{-1}$, with the twist remaining fixed at $\sim 88\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}$, which generated two independent datasets for torque and normal force. The complete set of viscoelastic material parameters was estimated via a simultaneous fit to the analytical expressions for the torque and normal force predicted by the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model. The model's predictions were further validated through finite element simulations in FEniCS. Our results show that the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model - recently reappraised and largely unexploited - accurately fits the experimental data. Moreover, the estimated material parameters are in line with those obtained in previous studies on brain samples under torsion. When coupled with bespoke finite element models, these material parameters could enhance our understanding of the forces and deformations involved in traumatic brain injury and contribute to the design of improved headgear for sports such as boxing and motorsports. On the other hand, our novel testing protocol offers new insights into the mechanical behaviour of soft tissues other than the brain.</description>

      <title>Interfacial flows in sessile evaporating droplets of mineral water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.06647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid flow in sessile evaporating droplets of ultrapure water typically results from two main contributions: a capillary flow pushing the liquid towards the contact line from the bulk and a thermal Marangoni flow pulling the drop free surface towards the summit. Current analytical and numerical models are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations however they overestimate the interfacial velocity values by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This discrepancy is generally ascribed to contamination of the water samples with non-soluble surfactants, however an experimental confirmation of this assumption has not yet been provided. In this work, we show that a small "ionic contamination" can cause a significant effect in the flow pattern inside the droplet. To provide the proof, we compare the flow in evaporating droplets of ultrapure water with commercially available bottled water of different mineralization levels. Mineral waters are bottled at natural springs, are micro-biologically pure, and contain only traces of minerals (as well as traces of other possible contaminants), therefore one would expect a slower interfacial flow as the amount of "contaminants" increase. Surprisingly, our results show that the magnitude of the interfacial flow is practically the same for mineral waters with low content of minerals as that of ultrapure water. However, for waters with larger content of minerals, the interfacial flow tends to slow down due to the presence of ionic concentration gradients. Our results show a much more complex scenario than it has been typically suspected, and therefore a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the huge differences between numerical models and experiments is necessary.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>
