      <title>Continuous agent-based modeling of adult-child pairs based on a pseudo-energy: Relevance for public safety and egress efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushes, falls, stampedes, and crushes are safety hazards that emerge from the collective motion of crowds, but might be avoided by better design and guidance. While pedestrian dynamics are now getting better understood on the whole, complex heterogeneous flows involvinge.g. adult-child pairs, though widely found at e.g. crowded Chinese training schools, still defy the current understanding and capabilities of crowd simulation models. We substantially extend a recent agent-based model in which each agent's choice of motion results from the minimization ofa sum of intuitive contributions, in order to integrate adult-child pairs. This is achieved by adding a suitably defined pairing potential. The resulting model captures the relative positions of pair members in a quantitative fashion, as confirmed by small-scale controlled experiments, and alsosucceeds in describing collision avoidance between pairs. The model is used to simulate mixed adult-child flows at a T-junction and test the sensitivity to the design and pairing strategies. Simulation shows that making the post-confluence corridor wide enough is critical to avoidfriction in the flow, and that tight hand-holding is advisable for safer evacuations (whereas more loosely bound pairs get split at high density) and, more marginally, more efficient egresses in normal conditions.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hegselmann-Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann-Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann-Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann-Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann-Krause model.</description>

      <title>Recovery of contour nodes in interdependent directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdependent directed networks are essential in understanding the dynamics of real-world systems such as power grids and communication networks. A minor malfunction in such systems can propagate and lead to catastrophic consequences in a process known as cascading failures, which highlights the need for effective recovery strategies that help to mitigate or avoid eventual damages. In this work, we analyze the impact of a recovery strategy on cascading failures in two interdependent directed networks, where a fraction $q$ of nodes have single dependencies. After a random removal of a fraction $1 - p$ of nodes, we repair nodes in the contour of each giant strongly connected component, with probability $\gamma$. We find that the sustained application of the strategy leads to an abrupt transition between full collapse and complete recovery. Phase diagrams in the $(p, \gamma)$ plane reveal three regions: one where the system collapses despite intervention, another where the strategy ensures recovery, and a third where no intervention is necessary to avoid collapse. For obtaining these results, we develop an analytical framework using node percolation and generating functions that aligns well with simulation results.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Monte Carlo simulation of opinion dynamics under the influence of mass media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of large social groups having uniform opinions influenced by mass media is currently an important topic in the social sciences. In this work, we explore and extend an off-lattice, two-dimensional Potts model (Eur. Phys. J. B 87, 78 [2014]) that describes the formation and dynamics of opinions in social groups according to individual consequence and agreement between neighbors. This model was originally obtained by the application of the maximum entropy principle, a general method in statistical inference, and using the same methodology we have now included the influence of mass media as a constant external field. By means of microcanonical Monte Carlo Metropolis simulations on a setup with two regions with opposing external influences, we have shown the presence of metastable states associated to the formation of clusters aligned with the locally imposed opinion. Our results suggest that, for some values of the total energy of the system, only a single cluster with a uniform opinion survives, thus the presence of two large, opposing groups is not a thermodynamically stable configuration.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Edge-based Modeling for Disease Transmission on Random Graphs: An Application to Mitigate a Syphilis Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-based network models, especially those based on bond percolation methods, can be used to model disease transmission on complex networks and accommodate social heterogeneity while keeping tractability. Here we present an application of an edge-based network model to the spread of syphilis in the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox &amp; Addington (KFL&amp;A) region of Southeastern Ontario, Canada. We compared the results of using a network-based susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model to those generated from using a traditional mass action SIR model. We found that the network model yields very different predictions, including a much lower estimate of the final epidemic size. We also used the network model to estimate the potential impact of introducing a rapid syphilis point of care test (POCT) and treatment intervention strategy that has recently been implemented by the public health unit to mitigate syphilis transmission.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Analysis of a Predator-Prey Model with Additive Allee Effect and Prey Group Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a predator-prey model with Allee effect and prey group defense. The model has three equilibrium points i.e. the trivial point, the predator extinction point, and the coexistence point. All equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. The Allee effect in this model influences the stability of the equilibrium point. If the Allee effect is weak, then the trivial equilibrium point is unstable. Meanwhile, if the Allee effect is strong, then the trivial equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. Those mean that a strong Allee effect can lead to the extinction of both populations. Moreover, under weak Allee condition, forward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation occur at the predator extinction equilibrium point. Meanwhile, a strong Allee effect may induce bistability at both the trivial equilibrium point and the predator extinction equilibrium point. Those mean that prey can survive without the presence of predators, but a strong Allee effect can lead to prey extinction if the population size is very small. To support our analytical findings, we perform some numerical simulations in the final section.</description>

      <title>Connect-while-in-range: modelling the impact of spatial constraints on dynamic communication network structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like other social animals and biological systems, human groups constantly exchange information. Network models provide a way of quantifying this process by representing the pathways of information propagation between individuals. Existing approaches to studying these networks largely hypothesize network formation to be a result of cognitive biases and choices about who to connect to. Observational data suggests, however, that physical proximity plays a major role in shaping the formation of communication networks in human groups. Here we report results from a series of agent-based simulations in which agents move around at random in a bounded 2D space and connect while within communication range. Comparing the results to a non-spatial model, we show how including spatial constraints impacts our predictions of network structure: ranged networks are more clustered, with slightly higher degree, higher average shortest path length, a lower number of connected components and a higher small-world index. We find two important drivers of network structure in range-constrained dynamic networks: communication range relative to environment size, and population density. These results show that neglecting spatial constraints in models of network formation makes a difference for predicted network structures. Our simulation model quantifies this part of the process of network formation, realized by simply situating individuals in an environment. The model also provides a tool to include spatial constraints in other models of human communication, as well as dynamic models of network formation more generally.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the visual impact of wind farm lights on the nocturnal landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind farm lights are a conspicuous feature in the nocturnal landscape. Their presence is a source of light pollution for residents and the environment, severely disrupting in some places the aesthetic, cultural, and scientific values of the pristine starry skies. In this work we present a simple model for quantifying the visual impact of individual wind turbine lights, based on the comparison of their brightnesses with the brightness of well-known night sky objects. The model includes atmospheric and visual variables, and for typical parameters it shows that medium-intensity turbine lights can be brighter than Venus up to ~4 km from the turbine, brighter than alpha CMa (the brightest star on the nighttime sky) until about ~10 km, and reach the standard stellar visibility limit for the unaided eye (m_v=+6.00) at ~38 km. These results suggest that the visual range of wind farms at nighttime may be significantly larger than at daytime, a factor that should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.</description>

      <title>CosIn: A Statistical-based Algorithm for Computation of Space-speed Time Delay in Pedestrian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise assessment of Space-speed time delay (TD) is critical for distinguishing between anticipation and reaction behaviors within pedestrian motion. Besides, the TD scale is instrumental in the evaluation of potential collision tendency of the crowd, thereby providing essential quantitative metrics for assessing risk. In this consideration, this paper introduced the CosIn algorithm for evaluating TD during pedestrian motion, which includes both the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms. CosIn-1 algorithm analytically calculates TD, replacing the numerical method of discrete cross-correlation, whereas the CosIn-2 algorithm estimates the TD from a statistical perspective. Specifically, the CosIn-1 algorithm addresses the precise computation of TD for individual pedestrians, while the CosIn-2 algorithm is employed for assessing TD at the crowd scale, concurrently addressing the imperative of real-time evaluation. Efficacy analyses of the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms are conducted with data from single-file pedestrian experiments and crowd-crossing experiments, respectively. During this process, the discrete cross-correlation method was employed as a baseline to evaluate the performance of both algorithms, which demonstrated notable accuracy. This algorithm facilitate the precise evaluation of behavior patterns and collision tendency within crowds, thereby enabling us to understand the crowds dynamics from a new perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Galton board approximation method to analyze the potential walking preferences of pedestrians. We employ the binomial distribution to estimate the walking preferences of pedestrians in dynamic crowds. Estimating the probability of the right-side preference ($p$) based on observed data poses the challenge, as statistical measures such as means and variances often lead to divergent results. This study aims to explore this issue.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Chess positions: measure, universality and tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric to quantify the fragility of chess positions using the interaction graph of pieces. This fragility score $F$ captures the tension within a position and serves as a strong indicator of tipping points in a game. In well-known games, maximum fragility often aligns with decisive moments marked by brilliant moves. Analyzing a large dataset of games, we find that fragility typically peaks around move $15$, with pawns ($\approx 60\%$) and knights ($\approx 20\%$) frequently involved in high-tension positions. Remarkably, average fragility curves show a universal pattern across a wide range of players, games, and openings, with a subtle deviation observed in games played by the engine Stockfish. Our analysis reveals a gradual buildup of fragility starting around $8$ moves before the peak, followed by a prolonged fragile state lasting up to $15$ moves. This suggests a gradual intensification of positional tension leading to decisive moments in the game. These insights offer a valuable tool for both players and engines to assess critical moments in chess.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information-theoretic randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>
