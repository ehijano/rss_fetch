      <title>A model for the current-voltage characteristic of membrane/electrolyte junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the current-voltage characteristic of the junction between an Ion-Sensitive-Membrane and an electrolyte solution is derived and compared with numerical simulations of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model for ion transport. The expression resembles that of a semiconductor pn junction with a non-ideality factor of 2. The non-ideality correlated to the voltage drop in the electrolyte induced by the re-arrangement of the counter-ions.</description>

      <title>Speeds of sound for a biogas mixture $CH_{4}$ + $N_{2}$ + $CO_{2}$ + $CO$ from $p$ = (1-12) MPa at $T$ = (273, 300 and 325) K measured with a spherical resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims to measure speeds of sound $c$ in a biogas mixture of $CH_{4}$ + $N_{2}$ + $CO_{2}$ + $CO$, at $p$ = (1-12) MPa and $T$ = (273, 300 and 325) K, using a spherical acoustical resonator. The results are fitted to the virial acoustic equation of state, and the virial acoustic coefficients are obtained, $\beta_{a}$ and $\gamma_{a}$ and extrapolated to zero pressure, determining the adiabatic coefficient as perfect gas, $\gamma^{pg}$, and the isobaric and isochoric heat capacities as perfect gas, $C_{p}^{pg}$ and $C_{V}^{pg}$, respectively. The speeds of sound are acquired with a mean expanded relative uncertainty of 165 parts in $10^{6}$ ($k$ = 2) and are compared with the results predicted by the reference equation of state for this kind of mixture (natural gas-like mixtures), EoS GERG-2008. Relative deviations between experimental data and values estimated by this model were less than 700 parts in $10^{6}$ at $T$ = 325 K, and below 400 parts in $10^{6}$, and within measurement uncertainty of at $T$ = 300 K, although appreciably higher at isotherm $T$ = 273 K at the highest pressure data for this work, and even reaching values above 3 400 parts in $10^{6}$.</description>

      <title>Volumetric behaviour of (carbon dioxide + hydrocarbon) mixtures at high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interest of oil industry in increasing heavy oil production has promoted the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques such as $CO_{2}$ injection, which produce a decrease of oil viscosity and displacement of heavy oil from reservoir to surface. The design of these processes requires accurate data of densities, viscosities or surface tensions of ($CO_{2}$ + hydrocarbon) mixtures in order to simulate the behaviour of these mixtures in the reservoir. An automated Anton Paar DMA HPM vibrating-tube densimeter was used to measure densities of this kind of mixtures, and a new mixture injection system, by means of two syringe pumps, was developed for the densimeter. The equipment operates at high pressure, which is controlled through a back pressure valve and a variable volume cylinder with a stepper motor. The estimated standard uncertainty of the density is $\mathrm{\pm0.9 \ kg \cdot m^{-3}}$ at temperatures below 373.15 K and pressure range (0.1-140) MPa.In this paper, the densities of the mixtures ($CO_{2}$ + $n$-decane), ($CO_{2}$ + $n$-dodecane) and ($CO_{2}$ + squalane) are reported at $T$ = (283.15-393.15) K and $p$ = (10-100) MPa.</description>

      <title>Absolute standard hydrogen electrode potential and redox potentials of atoms and molecules: machine learning aided first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a self-consistent first-principles framework that accurately predicts the properties of electron transfer reactions through finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations is a dream of theoretical electrochemists and physical chemists. Yet, predicting even the absolute standard hydrogen electrode potential, the most fundamental reference for electrode potentials, proves to be extremely challenging. Here, we show that a hybrid functional incorporating 25 % exact exchange enables quantitative predictions when statistically accurate phase-space sampling is achieved via thermodynamic integrations and thermodynamic perturbation theory calculations, utilizing machine-learned force fields and $\Delta$-machine learning models. The application to seven redox couples, including molecules and transition metal ions, demonstrates that the hybrid functional can predict redox potentials across a wide range of potentials with an average error of 80 mV.</description>

      <title>Duality of particle-hole and particle-particle theories for strongly correlated electronic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to electron correlation for multireference systems. It is based on particle-hole (ph) and particle-particle (pp) theories in the second-order, developed in the random phase approximation (RPA) framework for multireference wavefunctions. We show a formal correspondence (duality), between contributions to the correlation energy in the ph and pp pictures. It allows us to describe correlation energy by rigorously combining pp and ph terms, avoiding correlation double counting. The multireference ph, pp, and the combined correlation methods are applied to ground and excited states of systems in the intermediate and strong correlation regimes and compared with the multireference second-order perturbation method (MRPT2). It is shown that the pp approximation fails to describe dissociation of multiple bonds. The ph-pp combined method is overall superior to both ph and pp alone. It parallels good accuracy of the second-order perturbation theory for ground states and singlet excitation energies. For the singlet-triplet gaps of biradicals its accuracy is significantly better. This is impressive, taking into account that it relies only on one- and two-body density matrices, while MRPT2 methods typically require density matrices up to the four-body.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amide+ketone mixtures. 2. Volumetric, speed of sound and refractive index data for N,N-dimethylacetamide+2-alkanone systems at several temperatures. Application of Flory's model to tertiary amide+n-alkanone systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on density, $\rho$, speed of sound, $c$, and refractive index, $n_{\text{D}}$, have been reported at (293-303.15) K for the N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) + CH$_3$CO(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$CH$_3$ ($u$ = 1, 2, 3) systems, and at 298.15 K for the mixture with $u$ = 5. These data have been used to compute excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, excess adiabatic compressibilities, $\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$, and excess speeds of sound $c^{\text{E}}$. Negative $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values indicate the existence of structural effects and interactions between unlike molecules. From excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, available in the literature for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) + n-alkanone systems, it is shown: (i) amide-ketone interactions are stronger in DMF systems than in those with NMP; (ii) they become weaker when $u$ increases in mixtures with a given amide. Structural effects largely contribute to $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and are more relevant in mixtures containing NMP. The application of the Flory's model reveals that the random mixing hypothesis is valid to a large extent for DMF solutions, while NMP systems are characterized by rather strong orientational effects. From values of molar refraction and of the product $P_{\text{int}} V_{\text{m}}$ (where $P_{\text{int}}$ is the internal pressure and $V_{\text{m}}$ the molar volume), it is concluded that dispersive interactions increase with $u$, or when DMF is replaced by DMA in mixtures with a fixed ketone.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Two-Photon Absorption of Molecules through Efficient Optimization of Entangled Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report how the unique temporal and spectral features of pulsed entangled photons from a parametric downconversion source can be utilized for manipulating electronic excitations through the optimization of their spectral phase. A new comprehensive optimization protocol based on Bayesian optimization has been developed in this work to selectively excite electronic states accessible by two-photon absorption. Using our optimization method, the entangled two-photon absorption probability for a thiophene dendrimer can be enhanced by up to a factor of 20 while classical light turns out to be nonoptimizable. Moreover, the optimization involving photon entanglement enables selective excitation that would not be possible otherwise. In addition to optimization, we have explored entangled two-photon absorption in the small entanglement time limit showing that entangled light can excite molecular electronic states that are vanishingly small for classical light. We demonstrate these opportunities with an application to a thiophene dendrimer.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Mechanical and thermodynamic routes to the liquid-liquid interfacial tension and mixing free energy by molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we carried out equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations of the liquid-liquid interface between two different Lennard-Jones components with varying miscibility, where we examined the relation between the interfacial tension and isolation free energy using both a mechanical and thermodynamic approach. Using the mechanical approach, we obtained a stress distribution around a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) EMD systems with a flat LL interface. From the stress distribution, we calculated the liquid-liquid interfacial tension based on Bakker's equation, which uses the stress anisotropy around the interface, and measures how it varies with miscibility. The second approach uses thermodynamic integration by enforcing quasi-static isolation of the two liquids to calculate the free energy. This uses the same EMD systems as the mechanical approach, with both extended dry-surface and phantom-wall (PW) schemes applied. When the two components were immiscible, the interfacial tension and isolation free energy were in good agreement, provided all kinetic and interaction contributions were included in the stress. When the components were miscible, the values were significantly different. From the result of PW for the case of completely mixed liquids, the difference was attributed to the additional free energy required to separate the binary mixture into single components against the osmotic pressure prior to the complete detachment of the two components, i.e., the free energy of mixing.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the Raman scattering and charge transfer properties of molecules adsorbed on the surface of a tetrahedral Au$_{120}$ nanoparticle based on the time-dependent density functional tight-binding (TD-DFTB) method. We study Raman scattering (SERS) enhancements for pyridine where the molecule is adsorbed either on the tip (V complex) or surface (S complex) of the nanoparticle. The scattering intensity is enhanced by a factor of 3-15 due to chemical effects while significantly larger enhancements (in the order of 10$^2$-10$^4$) are observed for plasmon resonance excitation at an energy of 2.5 eV depending on the adsorption site. Furthermore, we demonstrate charge transfer between the nanoparticle and a fullerene-based molecule after pulsed excitation of the plasmon resonance which shows how plasmon excitation can lead to negative molecular ion formation. All of these results are consistent with earlier studies using either TD-DFT theory or experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Unimolecular processes in diatomic carbon anions at high rotational excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the millisecond to second time scale, stored beams of diatomic carbon anions C$_2{}^-$ from a sputter ion source feature unimolecular decay of yet unexplained origin by electron emission and fragmentation. To account for the magnitude and time dependence of the experimental rates, levels with high rotational and vibrational excitation are modeled for the lowest electronic states of C$_2{}^-$, also including the lowest quartet potential. Energies, spontaneous radiative decay rates (including spin-forbidden quartet-level decay), and tunneling dissociation rates are determined for a large number of highly excited C$_2{}^-$ levels and their population in sputter-type ion sources is considered. For the quartet levels, the stability against autodetachment is addressed and recently calculated rates of rotationally assisted autodetachment are applied. Non-adiabatic vibrational autodetachment rates of high vibrational levels in the doublet C$_2{}^-$ ground potential are also calculated. The results are combined to model the experimental unimolecular decay signals. Comparison of the modeled to the experimental rates measured at the Croygenic Storage Ring (CSR) gives strong evidence that C$_2{}^-$ ions in quasi-stable levels of the quartet electronic states are the so far unidentified source of unimolecular decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly excited C$_2{}^{-}$ ions prominently feature electron detachment at a mean decay time near 3 milliseconds with hitherto unexplained origin. Considering various sources of unimolecular decay, we attribute the signal to the electronic C$^4\Sigma^+_u$ state. Quartet C$_2{}^{-}$ levels are found to be stabilized against autodetachment by high rotation. Time constants of their rotationally assisted autodetachment into levels opening energetically at lower rotation are calculated by a theory based on the non-local resonance model. For some final levels of significantly less rotation the results conclusively explain the puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Predicted High-Pressure Hot Superconductivity in Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ Phases that Resemble the Type-II Clathrate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-temperature high-pressure superconducting hydrides are typically characterized by cage-like hydrogenic lattices filled with electropositive metal atoms. Here, density functional theory based evolutionary crystal structure searches find two phases that possess these geometric features and are related to the Type-II clathrate structure. In these $Fd\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and $R\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ phases the calcium atom occupies the larger cage and the lithium atom the smaller one. The highest superconducting critical temperatures predicted within the isotropic Eliashberg formalism, 330~K at 350~GPa for $Fd\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{16}$ and 370~K at 300~GPa for $R\overline{3}m$ Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$, suggest these structures fall in the class of high-energy-density quantum materials known as hot superconductors. As pressure is lowered the cage-like lattices distort with the emergence of quasimolecular hydrogenic motifs; nonetheless Li$_2$CaH$_{17}$ is predicted to be superconducting down to 160~GPa at 205~K.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric reconstruction of the Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. The basal (0001) plane of ${\alpha}$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was imaged with noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically-defined tip apex. The surface forms a complex $({\sqrt31} {\times} {\sqrt31})R{\pm}9{\deg}$ reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual O and Al surface atoms come directly from experiment; how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk was determined based on computational modeling. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Photon Statistics from Non-Hermitian Floquet Theory: High Harmonic Generation and Above-Threshold Ionization Spectra Detected via IR Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it seems that obtaining quantum properties of light from classical calculations is a self-contradictory claim, it is shown here that a unified mechanism governs the three distinct measurements of high harmonic generation spectra (HGS), above-threshold ionization (ATI), and IR photon number distribution, none of which require the quantization of the electromagnetic field. Here, the conditions that enable the calculations of HGS and ATI spectra for atoms interacting with high-intensity laser fields from photon statistics are first derived. Through the non-Hermitian theoretical simulation, the regimes where there is correspondence between the HHG and ATI spectra and annihilated pump photons (with post-selection) are identified. Consequently, the HGS and ATI spectra, as detected by XUV detectors, can be obtained by monitoring the fluctuations of the infrared absorbed photons.</description>
