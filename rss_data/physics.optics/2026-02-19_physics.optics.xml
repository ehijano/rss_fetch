      <title>Chem-SIM: Super-resolution Chemical Imaging via Photothermal Modulation of Structured-Illumination Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has attained high spatiotemporal delineation of subcellular architecture, yet offers limited insight into chemical composition. Here, we present Chem-SIM, a structured-illumination fluorescence detected mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, for super-resolution chemical imaging of microorganisms and mammalian cells. A computational pipeline combining Poisson maximum-likelihood demodulation and spectral normalization across wavenumber is implemented to robustly recover the weak IR-induced fluorescence intensity change under low photon budgets and convert the fluorescence intensity modulation to chemical fingerprints. A photothermal gating scheme further rejects water backgrounds in aqueous samples, while the IR pump maintains cellular activity at near-physiological temperature. Chem-SIM preserves full vibrational fingerprints, achieves SIM-grade lateral resolution, and operates in a high-throughput, camera-based format with minimal modifications and low photothermal load. At the single-bacterium level, Chem-SIM distinguishes stationary phase from log phase cells through chemical content mapping. In ovarian cancer cells, Chem-SIM delivers readouts of lipid chemistry under deuterium fatty acid treatment and resolves lipid droplets dynamics in live cells. Together, Chem-SIM provides an accessible route to super-resolved mapping of organelle chemistry, metabolism, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flat-top solitons and anomalous interactions in media with even-order dispersions and competing nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-top (FT) solitons are optical pulses that arise from the balance of dispersion and self-phase modulation in media with the competing cubic-quintic nonlinearity. Previously, FT solitons were studied only in the case of the second-order dispersion ($m=2$). Following the recent observation of pure-quartic solitons (corresponding to $m=4$), we here construct families of FT solitons in the setting with pure-high-even-order dispersion (PHEOD), including $m=4,6,8$, and $10$, and address interactions between them. The PHEOD solitons are completely stable, and, unlike the conventional solitons, they feature oscillatory tails. Interactions between the PHEOD solitons are anomalous, featuring repulsion and attraction between in- and out-of-phase solitons, respectively. These results expand the variety of optical solitons maintained by diverse dispersive nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Moss rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic devices depend critically on the dielectric materials from which they are made, with higher refractive indices and lower absorption losses enabling new functionalities and higher performance. However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Birefringence-Driven Anisotropic $\alpha$-MoO3 Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many anisotropic layered materials, despite their strong in-plane birefringence, exhibit substantial visible absorption, which severely restricts cavity lengths and hinders the observation of purely birefringence-governed optical phenomena. Here, we realize a birefringence-driven anisotropic optical cavity using $\alpha$-MoO3 flakes, capitalizing on their ultralow optical loss and pronounced in-plane birefringence. Using angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, we observe a mode-sensitive enhancement of anisotropy, dependent on both flake thickness and Raman shift. A unified model that incorporates the intrinsic Raman tensor, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion accurately reproduces the experimental data, elucidating how cavity resonances at both excitation and scattered wavelengths interact. Within this framework, the intrinsic phonon anisotropy is quantified, providing invaluable insights for accurately predicting ARPR responses and identifying crystallographic orientation. This work provides fundamental insights into birefringence-governed cavities and opens avenues for high-performance birefringent optics and cavity-enhanced anisotropic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Analysis of Mechanical and Thermal Response of an Ultrastable, Dual-Axis, Cubic Cavity for Terrestrial and Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportable all-optical atomic clocks represent the next-generation devices for precision time keeping, ushering a new era in encompassing a wide range of PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) applications in the civil and strategic sectors. Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment. Our findings provide design insights for developing robust dual-axis optical reference cavities, advancing the deployment of portable atomic clocks for next-generation applications in PNT, geodesy, VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and deep space missions.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Ultralow Noise Spiral Interferometric Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integration offers the potential to bring complex high-performance optical systems to the form factor of a compact semiconductor chip. However, the range of system functions accessible critically depends on the extent to which free-space and fiber components can be made integrable. The ultralow-expansion cavity-stabilized laser$-$often used in precision metrology, high-resolution sensors, and advanced systems in atomic physics$-$is one component that currently has no direct parallel on chip. Lasers stabilized to photonically-integrated resonators exist, but exhibit considerably higher frequency noise and are accompanied by large levels of frequency drift. We demonstrate here a new architecture for an ultranarrow linewidth integrated laser based on stabilization to a sinusoidal fringe of an interferometer having a long 25-m unbalanced delay line. Our interferometric laser not only advances the state-of-the-art for on-chip lasers, but we in addition introduce an amplitude locking scheme that greatly suppresses the laser's long-term frequency wander. We achieve a record on-chip fractional frequency noise of $5.6 \times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to a linewidth of 12 Hz centered at 1348 nm. To showcase the utility of this laser, we divide the optical carrier to microwave frequencies, demonstrating the ability to outperform state-of-the-art quartz crystal oscillators by 15 dB or more.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-encoded optical neural network wavefront sensing for high-speed adaptive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space optical communications with moving targets, such as satellite terminals, demand ultrafast wavefront sensing and correction. This is typically addressed using a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which pairs a high-speed camera with a lenslet array, but such systems add significant cost, weight, and power demands. In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric MEMS Phase Modulator for Silicon Nitride Platform in the Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the visible spectrum are essential for on-chip applications, requiring low-loss waveguides with broad transparency and efficient, low-power phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a compact, ultra-low-power phase modulator based on a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguide integrated with thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) that actuates a bridge-type MEMS. The suspended actuator exploits PZT's strong piezoelectric effect to induce mechanically driven phase shifts, enabling efficient modulation in a Mach--Zehnder interferometer. For 3~mm and 5~mm modulators, phase shifts of $1.45\pi$ and $2.5\pi$ are achieved at 10~V, corresponding to a scalability metric ($V_{\pi}\cdot L$) of 2.25~V$\cdot$cm at 635~nm. This represents an order-of-magnitude improvement in scalability over stress-optic PZT modulators. The devices also exhibit ultralow power consumption ($\sim 12\,\mathrm{nW}$), $\sim 5\,\mathrm{ms}$ rise time, and optical loss $&lt; 0.75\,\mathrm{dB/cm}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip beam shaping.</description>

      <title>Operator based propagation of Whittaker and Helmholtz Gauss beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compact operator-based technique that solves the paraxial wave equation for a broad class of structured light fields. Using the spatial evolution operator to propagate two families of physically apodized inputs, Gaussian apodized Whittaker integrals and Gaussian apodized Helmholtz fields, we derive closed form expressions that retain the Gaussian width and therefore describe finite energy beams. The method unifies and extends the Helmholtz Gauss families and readily generalizes to nonseparable nondiffracting architectures. Experiments on superposed Bessel Gauss beams confirm the predicted transverse rotations, demonstrating that this operator approach is a fast, transparent, and practical alternative to standard diffraction ntegral treatments</description>

      <title>Inverse Engineering of Optical Constants in Photochromic Micron-Scale Hybrid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced sensing via spectral noise reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a direct demonstration of quantum-enhanced sensing in the Fourier domain by comparing single- and two-photon interference in a fiber-based interferometer under strictly identical noise conditions. The simultaneous acquisition of both signals provides a common-mode reference that enables a fair and unambiguous benchmark of quantum advantage. Spectral analysis of the interferometric outputs reveals that quantum correlations do not increase the amplitude of the modulation peak, but instead lower the associated noise floor, resulting in the expected 3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable. These observations establish Fourier-domain quantum super-sensitivity as an operational and broadly applicable resource for precision interferometric sensing.</description>

      <title>WindDensity-MBIR: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction for Wind Tunnel 3D Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimentalists often use wind tunnels to study aerodynamic turbulence, but most wind tunnel imaging techniques are limited in their ability to take non-invasive 3D density measurements of turbulence. Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements.</description>

      <title>Low Photon Number Non-Invasive Imaging Through Time-Varying Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical imaging plays a crucial role in advancing science and technology, enabling applications in fields ranging from biomedicine to astronomy. However, imaging through scattering media such as biological tissues, fog, or turbulent atmosphere remains a major challenge. Light scattering and absorption in such media make imaging challenging; in the case of time varying scatterers and low-light regime imaging has not been demonstrated so far. We present the first demonstration of non-invasive imaging of dim objects hidden behind dynamic scattering layers, obtaining robust reconstruction even at extremely low photon counts per frame. We achieve this by developing a new data-processing approach. In our experiment, we utilize a photon number resolving camera to capture a sequence of frames, containing on average, less than one photon per pixel. We validate our approach in microscopy, where we reconstruct images of biological samples stained with standard fluorescent dyes. Beyond microscopy, our approach can be applied in LIDAR systems for imaging through fog, and endoscopy using multimode and multicore fibers.</description>

      <title>Three-Photon Saturable Absorption in Atomically Thin Phlogopite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties, hold significant potential for future optical and electrical applications. In this study, the synthesis of 2D phlogopite (magnesium-rich mica) via liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is reported using an efficient and scalable procedure. XRD structural analysis revealed a preferential orientation along the (033) plane, whereas AFM and SEM demonstrated a nanoscale thickness and homogeneous morphology. Optical characterisation by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy shows tuneable band gaps up to 4.52 eV for the exfoliated 2D phlogopite and distinct vibrational modes indicative of structural evolution. At intense laser conditions, three-photon saturable absorption (3PSA) behaviour was evidenced by light-modulated electrical property studies, which emphasise the potential for optical limiting, switching, and mode-locking applications. The present investigation indicates 2D phlogopite as a versatile material for next-generation optoelectronic devices of high-intensity light modulation.</description>

      <title>Imaging with super-resolution in changing random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media. The method processes large and diverse array datasets using sparse dictionary learning, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

      <title>Controlling coherence between waveguide-coupled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel waveguide design that incorporates a split-diode structure, allowing independent electrical control of transition energies of multiple emitters over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Lens-Absorber-Coupled Ti/Al Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We estimate a sensitivity of 1 $\mathrm{mK}\cdot\mathrm{Hz}^{-0.5}$ and a 95% detector yield.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>

      <title>Directed Nano-antennas for Laser Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.
  Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).</description>
