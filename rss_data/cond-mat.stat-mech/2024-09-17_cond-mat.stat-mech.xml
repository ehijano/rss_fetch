      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to 1d Poisson. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, and the statistics agrees with that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, we recover the expected 2d Poisson statistics. Our analysis uses numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions of an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$, fitting them to the spin chain data. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>Modified Jarzynski equality in a microcanonical ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in an ensemble of driven two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Consensus effects of social media synthetic influence groups on scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms for social interactions are an essential part of modern society. With the advance of technology and the rise of algorithms and AI, content is now filtered systematically and facilitates the formation of filter bubbles. This work investigates the social consensus under limited visibility in a two-state majority-vote model on Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. In the consensus evolution, each individual assimilates the opinion of the majority of their neighbors with probability $1-q$ and disagrees with chance $q$, known as the noise parameter. We define the visibility parameter $V$ as the probability of an individual considering the opinion of a neighbor at a given interaction. The parameter $V$ enables us to model the limited visibility phenomenon that produces synthetic neighborhoods in online interactions. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis to obtain the critical noise parameter as a function of the visibility $V$ and the growth parameter $z$. We find the critical exponents $\beta/\bar{\nu}$, $\gamma/\bar{\nu}$ and $1/\bar{\nu}$ of and validate their unitary relation for complex networks. Our analysis shows that installing and manipulating synthetic influence groups critically undermines consensus robustness.</description>

      <title>Influence of media disorder on DNA melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fractal form of the compact chromatin in vivo, we study the melting of a lattice DNA on the infinite cluster backbone near the three-dimensional site percolation critical point $(p_c=0.3116)$, which exhibits fractal-like properties, using Monte Carlo simulations. Further, we extend our study to other values of atmospheric disorder $(p_c\leq p \leq 1)$ and show how the melting temperature varies with a decrease in the availability of lattice sites mimicking the crowded environment inside the cell nucleus. Importantly, we found that the melting transition sharpens with a linear increase in the denaturation temperature as we increase the degree of disorder. Two separate disorder regimes showing weak and strong effects on melting can be identified. For simulations, we use the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth method in conjunction with a depth-first implementation of the Leath algorithm to generate the underlying disorder.</description>

      <title>Universally non-diverging Gr\"uneisen parameter at critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics, the thermodynamic response, such as the isothermal susceptibility, at critical points (CPs) presents a divergent-like behavior. An appropriate parameter to probe both classical and quantum CPs is the so-called Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$. Motivated by the results reported in Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{108}$, L140403 (2023), we extend the quantum version of $\Gamma$ to the non-additive $q$-entropy $S_q$. Our findings indicate that using $S_q$ at the unique value of $q$ restoring the extensivity of the entropy, $\Gamma$ is universally non-diverging at CPs. We unprecedentedly introduce $\Gamma$ in terms of $S_q$, being BG recovered for $q \rightarrow 1$. We thus solve a long-standing problem related to the $\textit{illusory}$ diverging susceptibilities at CPs.</description>

      <title>Ising model with varying spin strength on a scale-free network: scaling functions and critical amplitude ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel model to describe ordering in systems comprising agents which, although matching in their binarity (i.e., maintaining the iconic Ising features of ``+'' or ``-'', ``up'' or ``down'', ``yes'' or ``no''), still differing in their strength was suggested [Krasnytska et al., J. Phys. Complex., 2020, 1, 035008]. The model was analyzed for a particular case when agents are located on sites of a scale-free network and agent strength is a random variable governed by a power-law decaying distribution. For the annealed network, the exact solution shows a rich phase diagram with different types of critical behavior and new universality classes. This paper continues the above studies and addresses the analysis of scaling functions and universal critical amplitude ratios for the model on a scale-free network.</description>

      <title>The random free field scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Excess entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids is discussed from several perspectives. First, it is demonstrated that a vibrational paradigm of atomic dynamics in dense fluids can be used to obtain a simple and accurate estimate of the entropy without any adjustable parameters. Second, it is explained why a quasiuniversal value of the excess entropy of simple fluids at the freezing point should be expected, and it is demonstrated that a remaining very weak dependence of the freezing point entropy on the screening parameter in the Yukawa fluid can be described by a simple linear function. Third, a scaling of the excess entropy with the freezing temperature is examined, a modified form of the Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling is put forward, and some consequences are briefly discussed. Fourth, the location of the Frenkel line on the phase diagram of Yukawa systems is discussed in terms of the excess entropy and compared with some predictions made in the literature. Fifth, the excess entropy scaling of the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) is reexamined using the contemporary datasets for the transport properties of Yukawa fluids. The results could be of particular interest in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas, colloidal suspensions, electrolytes, and other related systems with soft pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>Eigenoperator approach to Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and dispersive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum physics is very modular: we first understand basic building blocks (``XXZ Hamiltonian'' ``Jaynes-Cummings'' etc.) and then combine them to explore novel effects. A typical example is placing known systems inside an optical cavity. The Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation method is particularly suited for dealing with these problems, since it casts the perturbation expansion in terms of operator corrections to a Hamiltonian, which is more intuitive than energy level corrections, as in traditional time-independent perturbation theory. However, the method lacks a systematic approach.% and has largely remained a niche topic. In these notes we discuss how \emph{eigenoperator decompositions}, a concept largely used in open quantum systems, can be employed to construct an intuitive and systematic formulation of Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. To illustrate this we revisit various papers in the literature, old and new, and show how they can instead be solved using eigenoperators. Particular emphasis is given to perturbations that couple two systems with very different transition frequencies (highly off-resonance), leading to the so-called dispersive interactions.</description>

      <title>Disordered Yet Directed: The Emergence of Polar Flocks with Disordered Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flocking is a prime example of how robust collective behavior can emerge from simple interaction rules. The flocking transition has been studied extensively since the inception of the original Vicsek model. Here, we introduce a novel self-propelled particle model with quenched disorder in the pairwise alignment interaction couplings akin to a spin glass model. We show that the presence of quenched disorder can promote (rather than destroy) the emergence of global polar order. In particular, we show that our model can display a flocking phase even when the majority of the interaction couplings are anti-aligning. Activity is the key ingredient to reduce frustration in the system as it allows local particle clustering combined with self-organization of the particles to favor neighborhoods with strong cooperative interactions.</description>

      <title>Time Crystals from single-molecule magnet arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals, a unique non-equilibrium quantum phenomenon with promising applications in current quantum technologies, mark a significant advance in quantum mechanics. Although traditionally studied in atom-cavity and optical lattice systems, pursuing alternative nanoscale platforms for time crystals is crucial. Here we theoretically predict discrete time-crystals in a periodically driven molecular magnet array, modeled by a spin-S Heisenberg Hamiltonian with significant quadratic anisotropy, taken with realistic and experimentally relevant physical parameters. Surprisingly, we find that the time-crystal response frequency correlates with the energy levels of the individual magnets and is essentially independent of the exchange coupling. The latter is unexpectedly manifested through a pulse-like oscillation in the magnetization envelope, signaling a many-body response. These results show that molecular magnets can be a rich platform for studying time-crystalline behavior and possibly other out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. We further develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)] in the 2D Ising field theory. The formalism developed in this work is applicable to many other 2D CFTs perturbed by relevant operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a higher derivative scalar field theory in the presence of a boundary and a classically marginal interaction. We first investigate the free limit where the scalar obeys the square of the Klein-Gordon equation. In precisely $d=6$ dimensions, modules generated by $d-2$ and $d-4$ dimensional primaries merge to form a staggered module. We compute the conformal block associated with this module and show that it is a generalized eigenvector of the Casimir operator. Next we include the effect of a classically marginal interaction that involves four scalar fields and two derivatives. The theory has an infrared fixed point in $d=6-{\epsilon}$ dimensions. We compute boundary operator anomalous dimensions and boundary OPE coefficients at leading order in the ${\epsilon}$ expansion for the allowed conformal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>

Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Relation between grand canonical ensemble, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein distribution: Quantum principle for bosons and bosonic vacuum state, a candidate for dark energy and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the conditions constituting a thermal equilibrium between two energy levels: (i) the total energy is equal in both levels; (ii) the temperature is equal for all particles. Exploiting these conditions, we derive a differential equation of thermal equilibrium that holds for all particles. Integration delivers the Boltzmann distribution, suggesting that it is the general distribution of thermal equilibrium. With excited-state and ground-state population numbers n2 and n1, respectively, Pauli's exclusion principle is formalized as n1=1-n2. Exploiting Einstein's rate-equation approach to Planck's law of blackbody radiation, we derive the equivalent quantum principle for bosons, n1=1+n2. Utilizing either quantum principle, as a boundary condition when integrating the differential equation of thermal equilibrium or by entering it into the Boltzmann distribution, delivers the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein distribution. The fermionic or bosonic ratios n2/n1 follow the Boltzmann distribution. These results suggest that the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions are special cases of the Boltzmann distribution, ruled by Pauli's exclusion principle or the quantum principle for bosons. The grand canonical ensemble equals the Boltzmann distribution. The relating principle and the inhibition/enhancement factors for fermions/bosons confirm the quantum principles. The quantum principle for bosons comprises a vacuum state. Consequently, a populated vacuum state should exist for all bosons. Vacuum states are not detectable, therefore, they are dark states. The vacuum states of all bosons contribute to dark energy, while only the matter-boson vacuum states contribute to dark matter, supporting the fact that the amount of dark energy exceeds that of dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Nematic Torques in Scalar Active Matter: when Fluctuations Favor Polar Order and Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of nematic alignment on scalar active matter in the disordered phase. We show that nematic torques control the emergent physics of particles interacting via pairwise forces and can either induce or prevent phase separation. The underlying mechanism is a fluctuation-induced renormalization of the mass of the polar field that generically arises from nematic torques. The correlations between the fluctuations of the polar and nematic fields indeed conspire to increase the particle persistence length, contrary to what phenomenological computations predict. This effect is generic and our theory also quantitatively accounts for how nematic torques enhance particle accumulation along confining boundaries and opposes demixing in mixtures of active and passive particles.</description>

      <title>Exact pre-transition effects in kinetically constrained circuits: dynamical fluctuations in the Floquet-East model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a classical circuit corresponding to a discrete-time kinetically constrained East model. We show that this classical "Floquet-East" model displays pre-transition behaviour which is a dynamical equivalent of the hydrophobic effect in water. For the deterministic version of the model we prove exactly: (i) a change in scaling with size in the probability of inactive space-time regions (akin to the "energy-entropy" crossover of the solvation free energy in water), (ii) a first-order phase transition in the dynamical large deviations, (iii) the existence of the optimal geometry for local phase separation to accommodate space-time solutes, and (iv) a dynamical analog of "hydrophobic collapse".</description>

      <title>Tree networks of real-world data: analysis of efficiency and spatiotemporal scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work computationally investigates an algorithm that was originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that it seeks the most efficient internal representation of the external world, namely a real-world dataset of patterns. The algorithm produces a transition from star graph to regular 1d lattice, passing through irregular scale-invariant trees, under the effect of a single control parameter. The relatively novel information-theoretic tools of the von Neumann entropy and its derivative, the specific heat, together with the recent definition of thermodynamic quantities, such as work and heat, for networks are reviewed and applied to inspect the tree structures produced by the formation protocol. We observe some consistency between the optimal thermodynamic efficiency for networks and the optimal pattern-matching efficiency, defined in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when the former is measured at the meso-resolution scale involved in the phase transition from star graph to scale-invariant network. We adduce the hypothesis of a richer frequency content at the meso-scale of the self-organized network to explain this observation. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the vicinity to the mentioned phase transition if it is faced with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler. A phase portrait of the tree-generating algorithm is provided and multiple phase transitions are identified.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Active Brownian Particles with Dry Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a field theoretic approach to capture the motion of a particle with dry friction for one- and two-dimensional diffusive particles, and further expand the framework for two-dimensional active Brownian particles. Starting with the Fokker-Planck equation and introducing the Hermite polynomials as the corresponding eigen-functions, we obtain the actions and propagators. Using a perturbation expansion, we calculate the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of both wet and dry frictions in a perturbative way via the Green-Kubo relation. We further compare the analytical result with the numerical simulation. Our result can be used to estimate the values of dry friction coefficient in experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of a Two-Dimensional Blume-Capel Ferromagnet in an Oscillating Magnetic Field with a Constant Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a numerical study of the kinetic Blume-Capel (BC) model to find if it exhibits the metamagnetic anomalies previously observed in the kinetic Ising model for supercritical periods. We employ a heat-bath Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm on a square lattice in which spins can take values of $\pm 1, 0$, with a non-zero crystal field, subjected to a sinusoidal oscillating field in conjunction with a constant bias. In the ordered region, we find an equivalent hysteretic response of the order parameters with its respective conjugate fields between the kinetic and the equilibrium model. In the disordered region (supercritical periods), we observed two peaks, symmetrical with respect to zero bias, in the susceptibility and scaled variance curves, consistent with the numerical and experimental findings on the kinetic Ising model. This behavior does not have a counterpart in the equilibrium model. Furthermore, we find that the peaks occur at higher values of the bias field and become progressively smaller as the density of zeros, or the amplitude of the oscillating field, increases. Using nucleation theory, we demonstrate that these fluctuations, as in the Ising model, are not a critical phenomenon, but that they are associated with a crossover between a single-droplet (SD) and a multi-droplet (MD) magnetization switching mechanism. For strong (weak) bias, the SD (MD) mechanism dominates. We also found that the zeros concentrate on the droplets' surfaces, which may cause a reduced interface tension in comparison with the Ising model . Our results suggest that metamagnetic anomalies are not particular to the kinetic Ising model, but rather are a general characteristic of spin kinetic models, and provide further evidence that the equivalence between dynamical phase transitions and equilibrium ones is only valid near the critical point.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>
