      <title>Non-Interrupting Rail Track Geometry Measurement System Using UAV and LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety of train operations is largely dependent on the health of rail tracks, necessitating regular and meticulous inspection and maintenance. A significant part of such inspections involves geometric measurements of the tracks to detect any potential problems. Traditional methods for track geometry measurements, while proven to be accurate, require track closures during inspections, and consume a considerable amount of time as the inspection area grows, causing significant disruptions to regular operations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a track geometry measurement system (TGMS) that utilizes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform equipped with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. Integrated with a state-of-the-art machine-learning-based computer vision algorithm, and a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, this platform can conduct rail geometry inspections seamlessly over a larger area without interrupting rail operations. In particular, this semi- or fully automated measurement is found capable of measuring critical rail geometry irregularities in gauge, curvature, and profile with sub-inch accuracy. Cross-level and warp are not measured due to the absence of gravity data. By eliminating operational interruptions, our system offers a more streamlined, cost-effective, and safer solution for inspecting and maintaining rail infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Oogway: Designing, Implementing, and Testing an AUV for RoboSub 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Duke Robotics Club is proud to present our robot for the 2023 RoboSub Competition: Oogway. Oogway marks one of the largest design overhauls in club history. Beyond a revamped formfactor, some of Oogway's notable features include all-new computer vision software, advanced sonar integration, novel acoustics hardware processing, and upgraded stereoscopic cameras. Oogway was built on the principle of independent, well-integrated, and reliable subsystems. Individual components and subsystems were tested and designed separately. Oogway's most advanced capabilities are a result of the tight integration between these subsystems. Such examples include sonar-assisted computer vision algorithms and robot-agnostic controls configured in part through the robot's 3D model. The success of constructing and testing Oogway in under 2 year's time can be attributed to 20+ contributing club members, supporters within Duke's Pratt School of Engineering, and outside sponsors.</description>

      <title>V2I-Calib++: A Multi-terminal Spatial Calibration Approach in Urban Intersections for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban intersections, dense with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and compounded by GPS signal obstructions from high-rise buildings, are among the most challenging areas in urban traffic systems. Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

      <title>Incorporating Task Progress Knowledge for Subgoal Generation in Robotic Manipulation through Image Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the progress of a task allows humans to not only track what has been done but also to better plan for future goals. We demonstrate TaKSIE, a novel framework that incorporates task progress knowledge into visual subgoal generation for robotic manipulation tasks. We jointly train a recurrent network with a latent diffusion model to generate the next visual subgoal based on the robot's current observation and the input language command. At execution time, the robot leverages a visual progress representation to monitor the task progress and adaptively samples the next visual subgoal from the model to guide the manipulation policy. We train and validate our model in simulated and real-world robotic tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN manipulation benchmark. We find that the inclusion of task progress knowledge can improve the robustness of trained policy for different initial robot poses or various movement speeds during demonstrations.

      <title>Safety-critical Motion Planning for Collaborative Legged Loco-Manipulation over Discrete Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As legged robots are deployed in industrial and autonomous construction tasks requiring collaborative manipulation, they must handle object manipulation while maintaining stable locomotion. The challenge intensifies in real-world environments, where they should traverse discrete terrain, avoid obstacles, and coordinate with other robots for safe loco-manipulation. This work addresses safe motion planning for collaborative manipulation of an unknown payload on discrete terrain while avoiding obstacles. Our approach uses two sets of model predictive controllers (MPCs) as motion planners: a global MPC generates a safe trajectory for the team with obstacle avoidance, while decentralized MPCs for each robot ensure safe footholds on discrete terrain as they follow the global trajectory. A model reference adaptive whole-body controller (MRA-WBC) then tracks the desired path, compensating for model uncertainties from the unknown payload. We validated our method in simulation and hardware on a team of Unitree robots. The results demonstrate that our approach successfully guides the team through obstacle courses, requiring planar positioning and height adjustments, and all happening on discrete terrain such as stepping stones.</description>

      <title>GSRM: Building Roadmaps for Query-Efficient and Near-Optimal Path Planning Using a Reaction Diffusion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots frequently navigate on roadmaps, i.e., graphs where edges represent safe motions, in applications such as healthcare, hospitality, and warehouse automation. Often the environment is quasi-static, i.e., it is sufficient to construct a roadmap once and then use it for any future planning queries. Roadmaps are typically used with graph search algorithm to find feasible paths for the robots. Therefore, the roadmap should be well-connected, and graph searches should produce near-optimal solutions with short solution paths while simultaneously be computationally efficient to execute queries quickly.
  We propose a new method to construct roadmaps based on the Gray-Scott reaction diffusion system and Delaunay triangulation. Our approach, GSRM, produces roadmaps with evenly distributed vertices and edges that are well-connected even in environments with challenging narrow passages. Empirically, we compare to classical roadmaps generated by 8-connected grids, probabilistic roadmaps (PRM, SPARS2), and optimized roadmap graphs (ORM). Our results show that GSRM consistently produces superior roadmaps that are well-connected, have high query efficiency, and result in short solution paths.</description>

      <title>NAR-*ICP: Neural Execution of Classical ICP-based Pointcloud Registration Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) framework, allowing to train neural networks to effectively reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based learning framework, NAR-*ICP, which learns the intermediate algorithmic steps of classical ICP-based pointcloud registration algorithms, and extend the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark with classical robotics perception algorithms. We evaluate our approach across diverse datasets, from real-world to synthetic, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex and noisy inputs, along with its potential to be used as part of a larger learning system. Our results indicate that our method achieves superior performance across all benchmarks and datasets, consistently surpassing even the algorithms it has been trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</description>

      <title>What Am I? Evaluating the Effect of Language Fluency and Task Competency on the Perception of a Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robot capabilities have enabled them to interact with people in various human-social environments (HSEs). In many of these environments, the perception of the robot often depends on its capabilities, e.g., task competency, language fluency, etc. To enable fluent human-robot interaction (HRI) in HSEs, it is crucial to understand the impact of these capabilities on the perception of the robot. Although many works have investigated the effects of various robot capabilities on the robot's perception separately, in this paper, we present a large-scale HRI study (n = 60) to investigate the combined impact of both language fluency and task competency on the perception of a robot. The results suggest that while language fluency may play a more significant role than task competency in the perception of the verbal competency of a robot, both language fluency and task competency contribute to the perception of the intelligence and reliability of the robot. The results also indicate that task competency may play a more significant role than language fluency in the perception of meeting expectations and being a good teammate. The findings of this study highlight the relationship between language fluency and task competency in the context of social HRI and will enable the development of more intelligent robots in the future.</description>

      <title>HoloSpot: Intuitive Object Manipulation via Mixed Reality Drag-and-Drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-robot interaction through mixed reality (MR) technologies enables novel, intuitive interfaces to control robots in remote operations. Such interfaces facilitate operations in hazardous environments, where human presence is risky, yet human oversight remains crucial. Potential environments include disaster response scenarios and areas with high radiation or toxic chemicals. In this paper we present an interface system projecting a 3D representation of a scanned room as a scaled-down 'dollhouse' hologram, allowing users to select and manipulate objects using a straightforward drag-and-drop interface. We then translate these drag-and-drop user commands into real-time robot actions based on the recent Spot-Compose framework. The Unity-based application provides an interactive tutorial and a user-friendly experience, ensuring ease of use. Through comprehensive end-to-end testing, we validate the system's capability in executing pick-and-place tasks and a complementary user study affirms the interface's intuitive controls. Our findings highlight the advantages of this interface in improving user experience and operational efficiency. This work lays the groundwork for a robust framework that advances the potential for seamless human-robot collaboration in diverse applications.

      <description>arXiv:2410.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a robot encounters a novel object, how should it respond$\unicode{x2014}$what data should it collect$\unicode{x2014}$so that it can find the object in the future? In this work, we present a method for learning image features of an unknown number of novel objects. To do this, we use active coverage with respect to latent uncertainties of the novel descriptions. We apply ergodic stability and PAC-Bayes theory to extend statistical guarantees for VAEs to embodied agents. We demonstrate the method in hardware with a robotic arm; the pipeline is also implemented in a simulated environment. Algorithms and simulation are available open source, see http://sites.google.com/u.northwestern.edu/embodied-learning-hardware .</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning For Robust Robotic Grasping In Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the threats in the dynamic environment include the unpredictability of the motion of objects and interferences to the robotic grasp. In such conditions the traditional supervised and reinforcement learning approaches are ill suited because they rely on a large amount of labelled data and a predefined reward signal. More specifically in this paper we introduce an important and promising framework known as self supervised learning (SSL) whose goal is to apply to the RGBD sensor and proprioceptive data from robot hands in order to allow robots to learn and improve their grasping strategies in real time. The invariant SSL framework overcomes the deficiencies of the fixed labelling by adapting the SSL system to changes in the objects behavior and improving performance in dynamic situations. The above proposed method was tested through various simulations and real world trials, with the series obtaining enhanced grasp success rates of 15% over other existing methods, especially under dynamic scenarios. Also, having tested for adaptation times, it was confirmed that the system could adapt faster, thus applicable for use in the real world, such as in industrial automation and service robotics. In future work, the proposed approach will be expanded to more complex tasks, such as multi object manipulation and functions in the context of cluttered environments, in order to apply the proposed methodology to a broader range of robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Biologically Inspired Swarm Dynamic Target Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven flight computer, integrating an online free-retraining-prediction model, a swarm control, and an obstacle avoidance strategy, to track dynamic targets using a distributed drone swarm for military applications. To enable dynamic target tracking the swarm requires a trajectory prediction capability to achieve intercept allowing for the tracking of rapid maneuvers and movements while maintaining efficient path planning. Traditional predicative methods such as curve fitting or Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) have low robustness and struggle with dynamic target tracking in the short term due to slow convergence of single agent-based trajectory prediction and often require extensive offline training or tuning to be effective. Consequently, this paper introduces a novel robust adaptive bidirectional fuzzy brain emotional learning prediction (BFBEL-P) methodology to address these challenges. The controller integrates a fuzzy interface, a neural network enabling rapid adaption, predictive capability and multi-agent solving enabling multiple solutions to be aggregated to achieve rapid convergence times and high accuracy in both the short and long term. This was verified through the use of numerical simulations seeing complex trajectory being predicted and tracked by a swarm of drones. These simulations show improved adaptability and accuracy to state of the art methods in the short term and strong results over long time domains, enabling accurate swarm target tracking and predictive capability.</description>

      <title>Using Zone Inflation and Volume Transfer to Design a Fabric-based Pneumatic Exosuit with both Efficiency and Wearability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabric-based pneumatic exosuits have a broad application prospect due to their good human-machine interaction performance, but their structural design paradigm has not yet been finalized and requires in-depth research. This paper proposes the concepts of zone inflation and volume transfer for the design of a fabric-based pneumatic exosuit with both efficiency and wearability. The meaning of zone inflation is to divide the inflation area of pneumatic exosuit into inflation-deflation zone and inflation-holding zone which can reduce the consumption of compressed air and improve efficiency. Volume transfer, a strategic distribution method of inflatable regions inside the garment, can effectively enhance the wearability of the exosuit. Using inexpensive thermoplastic polyurethane film and clothing fabric, the exosuit is made by heat pressing and sewing. The exosuit has a response time of 0.5s, a stress area of 1500mm2, and a profile of only 32mm, which can be hidden inside common clothing. A mathematical model is developed to predict the output torque of the exosuit with an error of 3.6%. Mechanical experiments show that the exosuit outputs a torque of 9.1Nm at a pressure of 100kPa. Surface electromyography experiments show that the exosuit can provide users with a boost from sitting to standing, with an average reduction in electromyography signals of 14.95%. The exosuit designed using these methods synthesizes efficiency and wearability and is expected to be an ideal paradigm for fabric-based pneumatic exosuits.</description>

      <title>Visual Manipulation with Legs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals use limbs for both locomotion and manipulation. We aim to equip quadruped robots with similar versatility. This work introduces a system that enables quadruped robots to interact with objects using their legs, inspired by non-prehensile manipulation. The system has two main components: a visual manipulation policy module and a loco-manipulator module. The visual manipulation policy, trained with reinforcement learning (RL) using point cloud observations and object-centric actions, decides how the leg should interact with the object. The loco-manipulator controller manages leg movements and body pose adjustments, based on impedance control and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Besides manipulating objects with a single leg, the system can select from the left or right leg based on critic maps and move objects to distant goals through base adjustment. Experiments evaluate the system on object pose alignment tasks in both simulation and the real world, demonstrating more versatile object manipulation skills with legs than previous work.</description>

      <title>GSORB-SLAM: Gaussian Splatting SLAM benefits from ORB features and Transmittance information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently sparked a renewed wave of dense visual SLAM research. However, current methods face challenges such as sensitivity to artifacts and noise, sub-optimal selection of training viewpoints, and a lack of light global optimization. In this paper, we propose a dense SLAM system that tightly couples 3DGS with ORB features. We design a joint optimization approach for robust tracking and effectively reducing the impact of noise and artifacts. This involves combining novel geometric observations, derived from accumulated transmittance, with ORB features extracted from pixel data. Furthermore, to improve mapping quality, we propose an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that enables Gaussian primitives to represent the scene compactly. This is coupled with a viewpoint selection strategy based on the hybrid graph to mitigate over-fitting effects and enhance convergence quality. Finally, our approach achieves compact and high-quality scene representations and accurate localization. GSORB-SLAM has been evaluated on different datasets, demonstrating outstanding performance. The code will be available.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Adapting Human-Robot Interaction to Diverse User Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate natural and intuitive interactions with diverse user groups in real-world settings, social robots must be capable of addressing the varying requirements and expectations of these groups while adapting their behavior based on user feedback. While previous research often focuses on specific demographics, we present a novel framework for adaptive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that tailors interactions to different user groups and enables individual users to modulate interactions through both minor and major interruptions. Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge. We validate the efficiency of our framework through module tests and system trials, demonstrating its high accuracy in age recognition and its robustness to repeated user inputs and plan changes.</description>

      <title>Towards Local Minima-free Robotic Navigation: Model Predictive Path Integral Control via Repulsive Potential Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based control is a crucial component of robotic navigation. However, it often struggles with entrapment in local minima due to its inherent nature as a finite, myopic optimization procedure. Previous studies have addressed this issue but sacrificed either solution quality due to their reactive nature or computational efficiency in generating explicit paths for proactive guidance. To this end, we propose a motion planning method that proactively avoids local minima without any guidance from global paths. The key idea is repulsive potential augmentation, integrating high-level directional information into the Model Predictive Path Integral control as a single repulsive term through an artificial potential field. We evaluate our method through theoretical analysis and simulations in environments with obstacles that induce local minima. Results show that our method guarantees the avoidance of local minima and outperforms existing methods in terms of global optimality without decreasing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>LLM2Swarm: Robot Swarms that Responsively Reason, Plan, and Collaborate through LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and represent domain and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.</description>

      <title>M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</description>

      <title>NavTopo: Leveraging Topological Maps For Autonomous Navigation Of a Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation of a mobile robot is a challenging task which requires ability of mapping, localization, path planning and path following. Conventional mapping methods build a dense metric map like an occupancy grid, which is affected by odometry error accumulation and consumes a lot of memory and computations in large environments. Another approach to mapping is the usage of topological properties, e.g. adjacency of locations in the environment. Topological maps are less prone to odometry error accumulation and high resources consumption, and also enable fast path planning because of the graph sparsity. Based on this idea, we proposed NavTopo - a full navigation pipeline based on topological map and two-level path planning. The pipeline localizes in the graph by matching neural network descriptors and 2D projections of the input point clouds, which significantly reduces memory consumption compared to metric and topological point cloud-based approaches. We test our approach in a large indoor photo-relaistic simulated environment and compare it to a metric map-based approach based on popular metric mapping method RTAB-MAP. The experimental results show that our topological approach significantly outperforms the metric one in terms of performance, keeping proper navigational efficiency.</description>

      <title>PAVLM: Advancing Point Cloud based Affordance Understanding Via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

      <title>A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</description>

      <title>SDS -- See it, Do it, Sorted: Quadruped Skill Synthesis from Single Video Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SDS (``See it. Do it. Sorted.''), a novel pipeline for intuitive quadrupedal skill learning from a single demonstration video. Leveraging the Visual capabilities of GPT-4o, SDS processes input videos through our novel chain-of-thought promoting technique (SUS) and generates executable reward functions (RFs) that drive the imitation of locomotion skills, through learning a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy, using environment information from the NVIDIA IsaacGym simulator. SDS autonomously evaluates the RFs by monitoring the individual reward components and supplying training footage and fitness metrics back into GPT-4o, which is then prompted to evolve the RFs to achieve higher task fitness at each iteration. We validate our method on the Unitree Go1 robot, demonstrating its ability to execute variable skills such as trotting, bounding, pacing and hopping, achieving high imitation fidelity and locomotion stability. SDS shows improvements over SOTA methods in task adaptability, reduced dependence on domain-specific knowledge, and bypassing the need for labor-intensive reward engineering and large-scale training datasets.

      <title>DeformPAM: Data-Efficient Learning for Long-horizon Deformable Object Manipulation via Preference-based Action Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic manipulation. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data. Code and data will be available at https://deform-pam.robotflow.ai.</description>

      <title>Robust Manipulation Primitive Learning via Domain Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation plays an important role in human daily activities, but uncertain parameters pose significant challenges for robots to achieve comparable performance through planning and control. To address this issue, domain adaptation and domain randomization have been proposed for robust policy learning. However, they either lose the generalization ability across diverse instances or perform conservatively due to neglecting instance-specific information. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to learn robust manipulation primitives, including parameter-augmented policy learning using multiple models, and parameter-conditioned policy retrieval through domain contraction. This approach unifies domain randomization and domain adaptation, providing optimal behaviors while keeping generalization ability. We validate the proposed method on three contact-rich manipulation primitives: hitting, pushing, and reorientation. The experimental results showcase the superior performance of our approach in generating robust policies for instances with diverse physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Safety Filtering While Training: Improving the Performance and Sample Efficiency of Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are flexible and performant but rarely guarantee safety. Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter, improving performance. Additionally, our modifications significantly improve sample efficiency and eliminate training-time constraint violations. We verified the proposed modifications in simulated and real experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. In experiments, we show that the proposed training approaches require significantly fewer environment interactions and improve performance by up to 20% compared to standard RL training.</description>

      <title>Robotic Arm Platform for Multi-View Image Acquisition and 3D Reconstruction in Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers significant benefits such as reduced recovery time and minimised patient trauma, but poses challenges in visibility and access, making accurate 3D reconstruction a significant tool in surgical planning and navigation. This work introduces a robotic arm platform for efficient multi-view image acquisition and precise 3D reconstruction in MIS settings. We adapted a laparoscope to a robotic arm and captured ex-vivo images of several ovine organs across varying lighting conditions (operating room and laparoscopic) and trajectories (spherical and laparoscopic). We employed recently released learning-based feature matchers combined with COLMAP to produce our reconstructions. The reconstructions were evaluated against high-precision laser scans for quantitative evaluation. Our results show that whilst reconstructions suffer most under realistic MIS lighting and trajectory, many versions of our pipeline achieve close to sub-millimetre accuracy with an average of 1.05 mm Root Mean Squared Error and 0.82 mm Chamfer distance. Our best reconstruction results occur with operating room lighting and spherical trajectories. Our robotic platform provides a tool for controlled, repeatable multi-view data acquisition for 3D generation in MIS environments which we hope leads to new datasets for training learning-based models.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Spacecraft Trajectory Generation via Multimodal Learning with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective trajectory generation is essential for reliable on-board spacecraft autonomy. Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), an unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.</description>

      <title>Octopus-Swimming-Like Robot with Soft Asymmetric Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater vehicles have seen significant development over the past seventy years. However, bio-inspired propulsion robots are still in their early stages and require greater interdisciplinary collaboration between biologists and roboticists. The octopus, one of the most intelligent marine animals, exhibits remarkable abilities such as camouflaging, exploring, and hunting while swimming with its arms. Although bio-inspired robotics researchers have aimed to replicate these abilities, the complexity of designing an eight-arm bionic swimming platform has posed challenges from the beginning. In this work, we propose a novel bionic robot swimming platform that combines asymmetric passive morphing arms with an umbrella-like quick-return mechanism. Using only two simple constant-speed motors, this design achieves efficient swimming by replicating octopus-like arm movements and stroke time ratios. The robot reached a peak speed of 314 mm/s during its second power stroke. This design reduces the complexity of traditional octopus-like swimming robot actuation systems while maintaining good swimming performance. It offers a more achievable and efficient platform for biologists and roboticists conducting more profound octopus-inspired robotic and biological studies.</description>

      <title>OKAMI: Teaching Humanoid Robots Manipulation Skills through Single Video Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of teaching humanoid robots manipulation skills by imitating from single video demonstrations. We introduce OKAMI, a method that generates a manipulation plan from a single RGB-D video and derives a policy for execution. At the heart of our approach is object-aware retargeting, which enables the humanoid robot to mimic the human motions in an RGB-D video while adjusting to different object locations during deployment. OKAMI uses open-world vision models to identify task-relevant objects and retarget the body motions and hand poses separately. Our experiments show that OKAMI achieves strong generalizations across varying visual and spatial conditions, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline on open-world imitation from observation. Furthermore, OKAMI rollout trajectories are leveraged to train closed-loop visuomotor policies, which achieve an average success rate of 79.2% without the need for labor-intensive teleoperation.

      <title>Adaptive Ankle Torque Control for Bipedal Humanoid Walking on Surfaces with Unknown Horizontal and Vertical Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable bipedal walking on surfaces with unknown motion remains a challenging control problem due to the hybrid, time-varying, partially unknown dynamics of the robot and the difficulty of accurate state and surface motion estimation. Surface motion imposes uncertainty on both system parameters and non-homogeneous disturbance in the walking robot dynamics. In this paper, we design an adaptive ankle torque controller to simultaneously address these two uncertainties and propose a step-length planner to minimize the required control torque. Typically, an adaptive controller is used for a continuous system. To apply adaptive control on a hybrid system such as a walking robot, an intermediate command profile is introduced to ensure a continuous error system. Simulations on a planar bipedal robot, along with comparisons against a baseline controller, demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively ensures stable walking and accurate tracking under unknown, time-varying disturbances.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth Humanoid Locomotion through Lipschitz-Constrained Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Touch-to-Touch Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's tactile sensors have a variety of different designs, making it challenging to develop general-purpose methods for processing touch signals. In this paper, we learn a unified representation that captures the shared information between different tactile sensors. Unlike current approaches that focus on reconstruction or task-specific supervision, we leverage contrastive learning to integrate tactile signals from two different sensors into a shared embedding space, using a dataset in which the same objects are probed with multiple sensors. We apply this approach to paired touch signals from GelSlim and Soft Bubble sensors. We show that our learned features provide strong pretraining for downstream pose estimation and classification tasks. We also show that our embedding enables models trained using one touch sensor to be deployed using another without additional training.

      <title>Tactile Displays Driven by Projected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could profoundly transform how we interact with computers, much like visual displays have driven successive revolutions in computing over the past 60 years. However, creating tactile displays with the actuation speeds, dynamic ranges, and resolutions that are required for perceptual fidelity has proved challenging. Here, we present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns using an energetically passive, photomechanical surface populated with arrays of millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through rapid, light-stimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding displacements of up to 1 millimeter and response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Our use of projected light for power transmission and addressing enables these displays to be scaled in size and resolution at sustainable cost and complexity. We demonstrate devices with up to 1,511 independently addressable pixels. Perceptual studies confirm the capacity of the display to accurately reproduce tactile patterns in location, timing, frequency, and structure. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Focus On What Matters: Separated Models For Visual-Based RL Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary challenge for visual-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to generalize effectively across unseen environments. Although previous studies have explored different auxiliary tasks to enhance generalization, few adopt image reconstruction due to concerns about exacerbating overfitting to task-irrelevant features during training. Perceiving the pre-eminence of image reconstruction in representation learning, we propose SMG (Separated Models for Generalization), a novel approach that exploits image reconstruction for generalization. SMG introduces two model branches to extract task-relevant and task-irrelevant representations separately from visual observations via cooperatively reconstruction. Built upon this architecture, we further emphasize the importance of task-relevant features for generalization. Specifically, SMG incorporates two additional consistency losses to guide the agent's focus toward task-relevant areas across different scenarios, thereby achieving free from overfitting. Extensive experiments in DMC demonstrate the SOTA performance of SMG in generalization, particularly excelling in video-background settings. Evaluations on robotic manipulation tasks further confirm the robustness of SMG in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Intramuscular High-Density Micro-Electrode Arrays Enable High-Precision Decoding and Mapping of Spinal Motor Neurons to Reveal Hand Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding nervous system activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we propose a novel neural decoding system that enables unprecedented large-scale sampling of muscle activity. Using micro-electrode arrays with more than 100 channels embedded within the forearm muscles, we recorded high-density signals that captured multi-unit motor neuron activity. This extensive sampling was complemented by advanced methods for neural decomposition, analysis, and classification, allowing us to accurately detect and interpret the spiking activity of spinal motor neurons that innervate hand muscles. We evaluated this system in two healthy participants, each implanted with three electromyogram (EMG) micro-electrode arrays (comprising 40 electrodes each) in the forearm. These arrays recorded muscle activity during both single- and multi-digit isometric contractions. For the first time under controlled conditions, we demonstrate that multi-digit tasks elicit unique patterns of motor neuron recruitment specific to each task, rather than employing combinations of recruitment patterns from single-digit tasks. This observation led us to hypothesize that hand tasks could be classified with high precision based on the decoded neural activity. We achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) across 12 distinct single- and multi-digit tasks, and consistently high accuracy (&gt;96\%) across all conditions and subjects, for up to 16 task classes. These results significantly outperformed conventional EMG classification methods. The exceptional performance of this system paves the way for developing advanced neural interfaces based on invasive high-density EMG technology. This innovation could greatly enhance human-computer interaction and lead to substantial improvements in assistive technologies, offering new possibilities for restoring motor function in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Latent-Predictive Empowerment: Measuring Empowerment without a Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empowerment has the potential to help agents learn large skillsets, but is not yet a scalable solution for training general-purpose agents. Recent empowerment methods learn diverse skillsets by maximizing the mutual information between skills and states; however, these approaches require a model of the transition dynamics, which can be challenging to learn in realistic settings with high-dimensional and stochastic observations. We present Latent-Predictive Empowerment (LPE), an algorithm that can compute empowerment in a more practical manner. LPE learns large skillsets by maximizing an objective that is a principled replacement for the mutual information between skills and states and that only requires a simpler latent-predictive model rather than a full simulator of the environment. We show empirically in a variety of settings--including ones with high-dimensional observations and highly stochastic transition dynamics--that our empowerment objective (i) learns similar-sized skillsets as the leading empowerment algorithm that assumes access to a model of the transition dynamics and (ii) outperforms other model-based approaches to empowerment.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning for Automata-based Objectives using Efficient Gradient-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using formal methods-based techniques to safely achieve temporal tasks, such as timed sequence of goals, or patrolling objectives. Such tasks are often expressed in real-time logics such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), whereby, the logical specification is encoded into an optimization problem. Such approaches usually involve optimizing over the quantitative semantics, or robustness degree, of the logic over bounded horizons: the semantics can be encoded as mixed-integer linear constraints or into smooth approximations of the robustness degree. A major limitation of this approach is that it faces scalability challenges with respect to temporal complexity: for example, encoding long-term tasks requires storing the entire history of the system. In this paper, we present a quantitative generalization of such tasks in the form of symbolic automata objectives. Specifically, we show that symbolic automata can be expressed as matrix operators that lend themselves to automatic differentiation, allowing for the use of off-the-shelf gradient-based optimizers. We show how this helps solve the need to store arbitrarily long system trajectories, while efficiently leveraging the task structure encoded in the automaton.</description>

      <title>RPCBF: Constructing Safety Filters Robust to Model Error and Disturbances via Policy Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have proven to be an effective tool for performing safe control synthesis for nonlinear systems. However, guaranteeing safety in the presence of disturbances and input constraints for high relative degree systems is a difficult problem. In this work, we propose the Robust Policy CBF (RPCBF), a practical method of constructing CBF approximations that is easy to implement and robust to disturbances via the estimation of a value function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation on a variety of high relative degree input-constrained systems. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of RPCBF in compensating for model errors on a hardware quadcopter platform by treating the model errors as disturbances.

      <title>Routing and Scheduling Optimization for Urban Air Mobility Fleet Management using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of urban air mobility (UAM) for urban transportation and delivery has accelerated due to increasing traffic congestion and its environmental and economic repercussions. Efficiently managing the anticipated high-density air traffic in cities is critical to ensure safe and effective operations. In this study, we propose a routing and scheduling framework to address the needs of a large fleet of UAM vehicles operating in urban areas. Using mathematical optimization techniques, we plan efficient and deconflicted routes for a fleet of vehicles. Formulating route planning as a maximum weighted independent set problem enables us to utilize various algorithms and specialized optimization hardware, such as quantum annealers, which has seen substantial progress in recent years. Our method is validated using a traffic management simulator tailored for the airspace in Singapore. Our approach enhances airspace utilization by distributing traffic throughout a region. This study broadens the potential applications of optimization techniques in UAM traffic management.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Unsupervised Skill Discovery for Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of intelligent agents is the ability to learn reusable skills purely from unsupervised interaction with the environment. However, existing unsupervised skill discovery methods often learn entangled skills where one skill variable simultaneously influences many entities in the environment, making downstream skill chaining extremely challenging. We propose Disentangled Unsupervised Skill Discovery (DUSDi), a method for learning disentangled skills that can be efficiently reused to solve downstream tasks. DUSDi decomposes skills into disentangled components, where each skill component only affects one factor of the state space. Importantly, these skill components can be concurrently composed to generate low-level actions, and efficiently chained to tackle downstream tasks through hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. DUSDi defines a novel mutual-information-based objective to enforce disentanglement between the influences of different skill components, and utilizes value factorization to optimize this objective efficiently. Evaluated in a set of challenging environments, DUSDi successfully learns disentangled skills, and significantly outperforms previous skill discovery methods when it comes to applying the learned skills to solve downstream tasks.

      <title>DIAR: Diffusion-model-guided Implicit Q-learning with Adaptive Revaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) approach, introducing the Diffusion-model-guided Implicit Q-learning with Adaptive Revaluation (DIAR) framework. We address two key challenges in offline RL: out-of-distribution samples and long-horizon problems. We leverage diffusion models to learn state-action sequence distributions and incorporate value functions for more balanced and adaptive decision-making. DIAR introduces an Adaptive Revaluation mechanism that dynamically adjusts decision lengths by comparing current and future state values, enabling flexible long-term decision-making. Furthermore, we address Q-value overestimation by combining Q-network learning with a value function guided by a diffusion model. The diffusion model generates diverse latent trajectories, enhancing policy robustness and generalization.

      <title>DODT: Enhanced Online Decision Transformer Learning through Dreamer's Actor-Critic Trajectory Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in reinforcement learning have led to the development of sophisticated models capable of learning complex decision-making tasks. However, efficiently integrating world models with decision transformers remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods. Our results indicate that the proposed integrated framework not only accelerates learning but also showcases robustness in diverse and dynamic scenarios, marking a significant step forward in model-based reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>LoGS: Visual Localization via Gaussian Splatting with Fewer Training Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual localization involves estimating a query image's 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) camera pose, which is a fundamental component in various computer vision and robotic tasks. This paper presents LoGS, a vision-based localization pipeline utilizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) technique as scene representation. This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map. Experimental results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's SoTA accuracy in estimating camera poses and robustness under challenging few-shot conditions.</description>

      <title>Latent BKI: Open-Dictionary Continuous Mapping in Visual-Language Latent Spaces with Quantifiable Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel probabilistic mapping algorithm, Latent BKI, which enables open-vocabulary mapping with quantifiable uncertainty. Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. Latent BKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). Latent BKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular MatterPort-3D and Semantic KITTI data sets, demonstrating that Latent BKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Suboptimality of Deterministic Policy Gradients in Complex Q-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, off-policy actor-critic approaches like DDPG and TD3 are based on the deterministic policy gradient. Herein, the Q-function is trained from off-policy environment data and the actor (policy) is trained to maximize the Q-function via gradient ascent. We observe that in complex tasks like dexterous manipulation and restricted locomotion, the Q-value is a complex function of action, having several local optima or discontinuities. This poses a challenge for gradient ascent to traverse and makes the actor prone to get stuck at local optima. To address this, we introduce a new actor architecture that combines two simple insights: (i) use multiple actors and evaluate the Q-value maximizing action, and (ii) learn surrogates to the Q-function that are simpler to optimize with gradient-based methods. We evaluate tasks such as restricted locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and large discrete-action space recommender systems and show that our actor finds optimal actions more frequently and outperforms alternate actor architectures.</description>

      <title>Prompt a Robot to Walk with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast internet-scale data have showcased remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Recently, there has been escalating interest in deploying LLMs for robotics, aiming to harness the power of foundation models in real-world settings. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly in grounding these models in the physical world and in generating dynamic robot motions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm in which we use few-shot prompts collected from the physical environment, enabling the LLM to autoregressively generate low-level control commands for robots without task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments across various robots and environments validate that our method can effectively prompt a robot to walk. We thus illustrate how LLMs can proficiently function as low-level feedback controllers for dynamic motion control even in high-dimensional robotic systems.

      <title>Object Importance Estimation using Counterfactual Reasoning for Intelligent Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to identify important objects in a complex and dynamic driving environment is essential for autonomous driving agents to make safe and efficient driving decisions. It also helps assistive driving systems decide when to alert drivers. We tackle object importance estimation in a data-driven fashion and introduce HOIST - Human-annotated Object Importance in Simulated Traffic. HOIST contains driving scenarios with human-annotated importance labels for vehicles and pedestrians. We additionally propose a novel approach that relies on counterfactual reasoning to estimate an object's importance. We generate counterfactual scenarios by modifying the motion of objects and ascribe importance based on how the modifications affect the ego vehicle's driving. Our approach outperforms strong baselines for the task of object importance estimation on HOIST. We also perform ablation studies to justify our design choices and show the significance of the different components of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotics have enabled robots to navigate complex scenes or manipulate diverse objects independently. However, robots are still impotent in many household tasks requiring coordinated behaviors such as opening doors. The factorization of navigation and manipulation, while effective for some tasks, fails in scenarios requiring coordinated actions. To address this challenge, we introduce, HarmonicMM, an end-to-end learning method that optimizes both navigation and manipulation, showing notable improvement over existing techniques in everyday tasks. This approach is validated in simulated and real-world environments and adapts to novel unseen settings without additional tuning. Our contributions include a new benchmark for mobile manipulation and the successful deployment with only RGB visual observation in a real unseen apartment, demonstrating the potential for practical indoor robot deployment in daily life.

      <title>Reasoning Grasping via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in robotic systems for operation within human-centric environments, existing models still heavily rely on explicit human commands to identify and manipulate specific objects. This limits their effectiveness in environments where understanding and acting on implicit human intentions are crucial. In this study, we introduce a novel task: reasoning grasping, where robots need to generate grasp poses based on indirect verbal instructions or intentions. To accomplish this, we propose an end-to-end reasoning grasping model that integrates a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) with a vision-based robotic grasping framework. In addition, we present the first reasoning grasping benchmark dataset generated from the GraspNet-1 billion, incorporating implicit instructions for object-level and part-level grasping. Our results show that directly integrating CLIP or LLaVA with the grasp detection model performs poorly on the challenging reasoning grasping tasks, while our proposed model demonstrates significantly enhanced performance both in the reasoning grasping benchmark and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>LAP, Using Action Feasibility for Improved Uncertainty Alignment of Large Language Model Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) showcase many desirable traits for intelligent and helpful robots. However, they are also known to hallucinate predictions. This issue is exacerbated in robotics where LLM hallucinations may result in robots confidently executing plans that are contrary to user goals, relying more frequently on human assistance, or preventing the robot from asking for help at all. In this work, we present LAP, a novel approach for utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs, alongside a novel Action feasibility metric, in robotic Planners that minimize harmful hallucinations and human intervention. Our key finding is that calculating and leveraging a new metric, which we call A-Feasibility, a measure of whether a given action is possible and safe in the provided scene, helps to mitigate hallucinations in LLM predictions and better align the LLM's confidence measure with the probability of success. We specifically propose an A-Feasibility metric which both combines scene context and prompting a LLM to determine if a given action is possible and safe in the scene, using the LLM's response to compute the score. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world on tasks with a variety of ambiguities, we show that LAP significantly increases success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to prior art. For example, in our real-world testing paradigm, LAP decreases the human help rate of previous methods by over 33% at a success rate of 70%.</description>

      <title>Learning Quadruped Locomotion Using Differentiable Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of using differentiable simulation for learning quadruped locomotion. Differentiable simulation promises fast convergence and stable training by computing low-variance first-order gradients using robot dynamics. However, its usage for legged robots is still limited to simulation. The main challenge lies in the complex optimization landscape of robotic tasks due to discontinuous dynamics. This work proposes a new differentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges. Our approach combines a high-fidelity, non-differentiable simulator for forward dynamics with a simplified surrogate model for gradient backpropagation. This approach maintains simulation accuracy by aligning the robot states from the surrogate model with those of the precise, non-differentiable simulator. Our framework enables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes without parallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allows the quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrains in minutes. We demonstrate that differentiable simulation outperforms a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) by achieving significantly better sample efficiency while maintaining its effectiveness in handling large-scale environments. Our method represents one of the first successful applications of differentiable simulation to real-world quadruped locomotion, offering a compelling alternative to traditional RL methods.</description>

      <title>CtRL-Sim: Reactive and Controllable Driving Agents with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating autonomous vehicle stacks (AVs) in simulation typically involves replaying driving logs from real-world recorded traffic. However, agents replayed from offline data are not reactive and hard to intuitively control. Existing approaches address these challenges by proposing methods that rely on heuristics or generative models of real-world data but these approaches either lack realism or necessitate costly iterative sampling procedures to control the generated behaviours. In this work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently generate reactive and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data through a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline RL dataset, annotated with various rewards. With this dataset, we train a return-conditioned multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of the initial dataset, including adversarial behaviours. We show that CtRL-Sim can generate realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained control over agent behaviours.</description>

      <title>AIC MLLM: Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects.Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly.However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses which is particularly prone to occur during articulated object manipulation.To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions for articulated object. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities.We design two types of prompt instructions for interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2) textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction. During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts.To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm.</description>

      <title>Ego-to-Exo: Interfacing Third Person Visuals from Egocentric Views in Real-time for Improved ROV Teleoperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are unmanned submersible vehicles designed for exploring and operating in the depths of the ocean. Despite using high-end cameras, typical teleoperation engines based on first-person (egocentric) views limit a surface operator's ability to maneuver the ROV in complex deep-water missions. In this paper, we present an interactive teleoperation interface that enhances the operational capabilities via increased situational awareness. This is accomplished by (i) offering on-demand "third"-person (exocentric) visuals from past egocentric views, and (ii) facilitating enhanced peripheral information with augmented ROV pose information in real-time. We achieve this by integrating a 3D geometry-based Ego-to-Exo view synthesis algorithm into a monocular SLAM system for accurate trajectory estimation. The proposed closed-form solution only uses past egocentric views from the ROV and a SLAM backbone for pose estimation, which makes it portable to existing ROV platforms. Unlike data-driven solutions, it is invariant to applications and waterbody-specific scenes. We validate the geometric accuracy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments of 2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in challenging low-light conditions. A subjective evaluation on 15 human teleoperators further confirms the effectiveness of the integrated features for improved teleoperation. We demonstrate the benefits of dynamic Ego-to-Exo view generation and real-time pose rendering for remote ROV teleoperation by following navigation guides such as cavelines inside underwater caves. This new way of interactive ROV teleoperation opens up promising opportunities for future research in subsea telerobotics.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has shown diffusion models are an effective approach to learning the multimodal distributions arising from demonstration data in behavior cloning. However, a drawback of this approach is the need to learn a denoising function, which is significantly more complex than learning an explicit policy. In this work, we propose Equivariant Diffusion Policy, a novel diffusion policy learning method that leverages domain symmetries to obtain better sample efficiency and generalization in the denoising function. We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant. We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9% higher than the baseline Diffusion Policy. We also evaluate the method on a real-world system to show that effective policies can be learned with relatively few training samples, whereas the baseline Diffusion Policy cannot.</description>

Abstract: A pivotal challenge in robotics is achieving fast, safe, and robust dexterous grasping across a diverse range of objects, an important goal within industrial applications. However, existing methods often have very limited speed, dexterity, and generality, along with limited or no hardware safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce DextrAH-G, a depth-based dexterous grasping policy trained entirely in simulation that combines reinforcement learning, geometric fabrics, and teacher-student distillation. We address key challenges in joint arm-hand policy learning, such as high-dimensional observation and action spaces, the sim2real gap, collision avoidance, and hardware constraints. DextrAH-G enables a 23 motor arm-hand robot to safely and continuously grasp and transport a large variety of objects at high speed using multi-modal inputs including depth images, allowing generalization across object geometry.

      <title>OrbitGrasp: $SE(3)$-Equivariant Grasp Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While grasp detection is an important part of any robotic manipulation pipeline, reliable and accurate grasp detection in $SE(3)$ remains a research challenge. Many robotics applications in unstructured environments such as the home or warehouse would benefit a lot from better grasp performance. This paper proposes a novel framework for detecting $SE(3)$ grasp poses based on point cloud input. Our main contribution is to propose an $SE(3)$-equivariant model that maps each point in the cloud to a continuous grasp quality function over the 2-sphere $S^2$ using a spherical harmonic basis. Compared with reasoning about a finite set of samples, this formulation improves the accuracy and efficiency of our model when a large number of samples would otherwise be needed. In order to accomplish this, we propose a novel variation on EquiFormerV2 that leverages a UNet-style encoder-decoder architecture to enlarge the number of points the model can handle. Our resulting method, which we name $\textit{OrbitGrasp}$, significantly outperforms baselines in both simulation and physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent instruction-following robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect larger quantities of autonomous data that can collectively improve their performance. However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved 2x with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.</description>

      <title>Explicit Contact Optimization in Whole-Body Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can exploit contacts anywhere on their body surface to manipulate large and heavy items, objects normally out of reach or multiple objects at once. However, such manipulation through contacts using the whole surface of the body remains extremely challenging to achieve on robots. This can be labelled as Whole-Body Contact-Rich Manipulation (WBCRM) problem. In addition to the high-dimensionality of the Contact-Rich Manipulation problem due to the combinatorics of contact modes, admitting contact creation anywhere on the body surface adds complexity, which hinders planning of manipulation within a reasonable time. We address this computational problem by formulating the contact and motion planning of planar WBCRM as hierarchical continuous optimization problems. To enable this formulation, we propose a novel continuous explicit representation of the robot surface, that we believe to be foundational for future research using continuous optimization for WBCRM. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement of convergence, planning time and feasibility - with, on the average, 99% less iterations and 96% reduction in time to find a solution over considered scenarios, without recourse to prone-to-failure trajectory refinement steps.</description>

      <title>Learning to Singulate Objects in Packed Environments using a Dexterous Hand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic object singulation, where a robot must isolate, grasp, and retrieve a target object in a cluttered environment, is a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation. This task is difficult due to occlusions and how other objects act as obstacles for manipulation. A robot must also reason about the effect of object-object interactions as it tries to singulate the target. Prior work has explored object singulation in scenarios where there is enough free space to perform relatively long pushes to separate objects, in contrast to when space is tight and objects have little separation from each other. In this paper, we propose the Singulating Objects in Packed Environments (SOPE) framework. We propose a novel method that involves a displacement-based state representation and a multi-phase reinforcement learning procedure that enables singulation using the 16-DOF Allegro Hand. We demonstrate extensive experiments in Isaac Gym simulation, showing the ability of our system to singulate a target object in clutter. We directly transfer the policy trained in simulation to the real world. Over 250 physical robot manipulation trials, our method obtains success rates of 79.2%, outperforming alternative learning and non-learning methods.</description>

      <title>M3Bench: Benchmarking Whole-body Motion Generation for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose M^3Bench, a new benchmark of whole-body motion generation for mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M^3Bench requires an embodied agent to understand its configuration, environmental constraints and task objectives, then generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement tasks. M^3Bench features 30k object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M^3BenchMaker. This automatic data generation tool produces coordinated whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions, requiring only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark incorporates various task splits to assess generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory evaluation. Through extensive experimental analyses, we reveal that state-of-the-art models still struggle with coordinated base-arm motion while adhering to environment-context and task-specific constraints, highlighting the need to develop new models that address this gap. Through M^3Bench, we aim to facilitate future robotics research towards more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Making a Complete Mess and Getting Away with it: Traveling Salesperson Problems with Circle Placement Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where the agent places a circular obstacle next to each node once it visits it. Referred to as the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Circle Placement (TSP-CP), the aim is to maximize the obstacle radius for which a valid closed tour exists and then minimize the tour cost. The TSP-CP finds relevance in various real-world applications, such as harvesting, quarrying, and open-pit mining. We propose several novel solvers to address the TSP-CP, its variant tailored for Dubins vehicles, and a crucial subproblem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem on self-deleting graphs (TSP-SD). Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed solvers outperform the current state-of-the-art on related problems in solution quality.</description>

      <title>LoRD: Adapting Differentiable Driving Policies to Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between operational domains can severely affect the performance of learned models in self-driving vehicles (SDVs). While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 8.83% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Shelf-Supervised Cross-Modal Pre-Training for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such 3D data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only, RGB-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.

      <title>Enhancing Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Cooperation in Decentralized MARL via GNN-driven Intrinsic Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is emerging as a key framework for various sequential decision-making and control tasks. Unlike their single-agent counterparts, multi-agent systems necessitate successful cooperation among the agents. The deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios often requires decentralized training, a diverse set of agents, and learning from infrequent environmental reward signals. These challenges become more pronounced under partial observability and the lack of prior knowledge about agent heterogeneity. While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity. Evaluation of CoHet in the Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) and Vectorized Multi-Agent Simulator (VMAS) benchmarks demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in a range of cooperative multi-agent scenarios. Our research is supplemented by an analysis of the impact of the agent dynamics model on the intrinsic motivation module, insights into the performance of different CoHet variants, and its robustness to an increasing number of heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Structured Data Processing through Robotic Process Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has emerged as a game-changing technology in data extraction, revolutionizing the way organizations process and analyze large volumes of documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and payment advices. This study investigates the use of RPA for structured data extraction and evaluates its advantages over manual processes. By comparing human-performed tasks with those executed by RPA software bots, we assess efficiency and accuracy in data extraction from invoices, focusing on the effectiveness of the RPA system. Through four distinct scenarios involving varying numbers of invoices, we measure efficiency in terms of time and effort required for task completion, as well as accuracy by comparing error rates between manual and RPA processes. Our findings highlight the significant efficiency gains achieved by RPA, with bots completing tasks in significantly less time compared to manual efforts across all cases. Moreover, the RPA system consistently achieves perfect accuracy, mitigating the risk of errors and enhancing process reliability. These results underscore the transformative potential of RPA in optimizing operational efficiency, reducing human labor costs, and improving overall business performance.</description>
