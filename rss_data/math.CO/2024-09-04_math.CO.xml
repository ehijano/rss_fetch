      <title>The extra basis in noncommuting variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergeron, Hohlweg, Rosas, and Zabrocki from 2006 to give a combinatorial description for the coproduct of the x-basis in the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions in noncommuting variables, NCSym, which arises in the theory of Grothendieck bialgebras. We achieve this using the theory of Hopf monoids and the Fock functor. We also determine combinatorial expansions of this basis in terms of the monomial and power sum symmetric functions in NCSym, and by taking the commutative image of the x-basis we discover a new multiplicative basis for the algebra of symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Uniform Shared Neighborhood Structures in Edge-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A shared neighborhood structure (SNS) in a graph is a subgraph induced by the intersection of the open neighbor sets of two adjacent vertices. If a SNS is the same for all adjacent vertices in an edge-regular graph, call the SNS a uniform shared neighborhood structure (USNS). USNS-forbidden graphs (graphs which cannot be a USNS of an edge-regular graph) and USNS in graph products of edge-regular graphs are examined.</description>

      <title>A note on an infinite family of graphs with all different integral Laplacian eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give an infinite family of optimal graphs called $G^+(d,c)$. They are optimal in the sense that they have the maximum possible number of vertices for given a diameter $d$ and the so-called `outer multiset dimension' $c$. We provide their spectra, which have the property that their Laplacian eigenvalues are all different and integral. Finally, we also obtained their eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Structural and Spectral Properties of Chordal Ring, Multi-ring and Mixed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chordal ring (CR) graphs are a well-known family of graphs used to model some interconnection networks for computer systems in which all nodes are in a cycle. Generalizing the CR graphs, in this paper, we introduce the families of chordal multi-ring (CMR), chordal ring mixed (CRM), and chordal multi-ring mixed (CMRM) graphs. In the case of mixed graphs, we can have edges (without direction) and arcs (with direction). The chordal ring and chordal ring mixed graphs are bipartite and 3-regular. They consist of a number $r$ (for $r\geq 1$) of (undirected or directed) cycles with some edges (the chords) joining them. In particular, for CMR, when $r=1$, that is, with only one undirected cycle, we obtain the known families of chordal ring graphs. Here, we use plane tessellations to represent our chordal multi-ring graphs. This allows us to obtain their maximum number of vertices for every given diameter. Besides, we computationally obtain their minimum diameter for any value of the number of vertices. Moreover, when seen as a lift graph (also called voltage graph) of a base graph on Abelian groups, we obtain closed formulas for the spectrum, that is, the eigenvalue multi-set of its adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Equivalence classes, solitary patterns and cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive theory on these graphs; see Lucchesi and Murty [Perfect Matchings, Springer 2024]. Two edges are mutually dependent if every perfect matching either contains both or neither. This is an equivalence relation and induces a partition of the edges; each part is called an equivalence class. Note that $\frac{n}{2}$ is an upper bound on the size of any equivalence class. We characterize those graphs that attain this upper bound, thus fixing an error in [Discrete Mathematics, 343(8), 2020].
  Sch\"onberger (1934) strengthened the famous result of Petersen by proving that every 2-connected cubic graph is matching covered. This immediately begs the question as to which 2-connected cubic graphs have the property that each edge belongs to two or more perfect matchings. An edge is solitary if it belongs to exactly one perfect matching. Note that if any member of an equivalence class is solitary then so is each member; such an equivalence class is called a solitary class. This leads us to the solitary pattern -- the sequence of sizes of solitary classes in nonincreasing order. For instance, $K_4$ has solitary pattern (2,2,2) whereas the Petersen graph has solitary pattern ().
  Using the theory of Lucchesi and Murty, we prove that every 3-connected cubic graph $G$ has one of the following solitary patterns: (2,2,2), (2,2,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1), (2), (1,1,1), (1,1), (1) or (); consequently, $G$ has at most six solitary edges. We also provide characterizations of 3-connected cubic graphs that have a given solitary pattern except for (1,1), (1) and (). Finally, we prove that every 2-connected cubic graph, except $\theta, K_4, \overline{C_6}$ and the bicorn, has at most $\frac{n}{2}$ solitary edges, and equality holds if and only if its solitary edges comprise a perfect matching.</description>

      <title>An unexpected property of $\mathbf{g}$-vectors for rank 3 mutation-cyclic quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be a rank 3 mutation-cyclic quiver. It is known that every $\mathbf{c}$-vector of $Q$ is a solution to a quadratic equation of the form $$\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i^2 + \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3} \pm q_{ij} x_i x_j =1,$$where $q_{ij}$ is the number of arrows between the vertices $i$ and $j$ in $Q$. A similar property holds for $\mathbf{c}$-vectors of any acyclic quiver. In this paper, we show that $\mathbf{g}$-vectors of $Q$ enjoy an unexpected property. More precisely, every $\mathbf{g}$-vector of $Q$ is a solution to a quadratic equation of the form $$\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i^2 + \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3} p_{ij} x_i x_j =1,$$where $p_{ij}$ is the number of arrows between the vertices $i$ and $j$ in another quiver $P$ obtained by mutating $Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $m$-location is a local combinatorial condition for flag simplicial complexes introduced by Osajda. Osajda showed that simply connected 8-located locally 5-large complexes are hyperbolic. We treat the nonpositive curvature case of 7-located locally 5-large complexes.
  We show that any minimal area disc diagram in a 7-located locally 5-large complex is itself 7-located and locally 5-large. We define a natural CAT(0) metric for 7-located disc diagrams and use this to prove that simply connected 7-located locally 5-large complexes have quadratic isoperimetric function. Along the way, we prove that locally weakly systolic complexes are 7-located locally 5-large.</description>

      <title>Connections between Combinations Without Specified Separations and Strongly Restricted Permutations, Compositions, and Bit Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ be, respectively, the number of subsets and $k$-subsets of $\mathbb{N}_n=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no two subset elements differ by an element of the set $\mathcal{Q}$. We prove a bijection between such $k$-subsets when $\mathcal{Q}=\{m,2m,\ldots,jm\}$ with $j,m&gt;0$ and permutations $\pi$ of $\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$ with $k$ excedances satisfying $\pi(i)-i\in\{-m,0,jm\}$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$. We also identify a bijection between another class of restricted permutation and the cases $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,q\}$. This bijection allows us to prove a conjectured recursion relation for the number of such permutations which corresponds to the case $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,4\}$. We also obtain recursion relations for $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ in the case $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,5\}$ by first obtaining related recursion relations for the numbers of closed walks of a given length on a particular class of directed pseudograph. We give some classes of $\mathcal{Q}$ for which $S_n$ is also the number of compositions of $n+q$ into a given set of allowed parts, where $q$ is the largest element of $\mathcal{Q}$. A bijection between the $k$-subsets for any $\mathcal{Q}$ and bit strings is also noted. Aided by this, an efficient algorithm for finding $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ is given. We also prove a bijection between $k$-subsets for a class of $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set representations of size $k$ of equivalence classes for the occurrence of a given length-($q+1$) subword within bit strings. We then formulate a straightforward procedure for obtaining the generating function for the number of such equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isomorphism problem for digraphs is a fundamental problem in graph theory. This problem for Cayley digraphs has been extensively investigated over the last half a century. In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In particular, $1$-Cayley digraph is just the Cayley digraph. We first characterize the normalizer of $G$ in the full automorphism group of an $m$-Cayley digraph of a finite group $G$. This generalizes a similar result for Cayley digraph achieved by Godsil in 1981. Then we use this to study the isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs. The CI-property of a Cayley digraph (CI stands for `Cayley isomorphism') and the DCI-groups (whose Cayley digraphs are all CI-digraphs) are two key topics in the study of isomorphisms of Cayley digraphs. We generalize these concepts into $m$-Cayley digraphs by defining $m$CI- and $m$PCI-digraphs, and correspondingly, $m$DCI- and $m$PDCI-groups. Analogues to Babai's criterion for CI-digraphs are given for $m$CI- and $m$PCI-digraphs, respectively. With these we then classify finite $m$DCI-groups for each $m\geq 2$, and finite $m$PDCI-groups for each $m\geq 4$. Similar results are also obtained for $m$-Cayley graphs. Note that 1DCI-groups are just DCI-groups, and the classification of finite DCI-groups is a long-standing open problem that has been worked on a lot.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Bipartiteness vs Bi-Partitioning in Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a fundamental concept in graph theory and have significant applications in data analysis and modeling complex processes. A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two sets, with no connections within each set. Detecting bipartite graphs can be done by examining their cycles; a graph is bipartite if and only if there are no odd cycles present. This characteristic is essential in various problem domains, such as clustering and matching. Bipartite graphs can be identified through the spectrum of the Laplacian, a graph is bipartite if and only if the maximum eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian equals two. However, graphs are limited to representing pairwise interactions, to model higher-order connections in complex systems, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes are required. This raises the question of what is bipartiteness for simplicial complexes of higher dimensions - whether obtaining the maximum eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian is equivalent to partitioning the simplexes into two, similar to the graph case. We address this problem by fully characterizing those complexes for which the maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian is obtained, known as disorientable simplicial complexes, based on the parity of the length of cycles in their down dual graph. We show that a N-dimensional simplicial complex is disorientable if and only if its down dual graph has no simple odd cycle of distinct edges and no twisted even cycle of distinct edges. We note that having no odd cycle is the key to answering the bi-partitioning problem of the simplexes.</description>

      <title>Every nonsymmetric $4$-class association scheme can be generated by a digraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (di)graph $\Gamma$ generates a commutative association scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ if and only if the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ generates the Bose-Mesner algebra of $\mathfrak{X}$. In [17, Theorem 1.1], Monzillo and Penji\'{c} proved that, except for amorphic symmetric association schemes, every $3$-class association scheme can be generated by an adjacency matrix of a (di)graph. In this paper, we characterize when a commutative association scheme with exactly one pair of nonsymmetric relations can be generated by a digraph under the certain assumptions. As an application, we show that each nonsymmetric $4$-class association scheme can be generated by a digraph.</description>

      <title>Grundy Packing Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A map $c:V(G)\rightarrow\{1,\dots,k\}$ of a graph $G$ is a packing $k$-coloring if every two different vertices of the same color $i\in \{1,\dots,k\}$ are at distance more than $i$. The packing chromatic number $\chi_{\rho}(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a packing $k$-coloring. In this paper we introduce the notion of \textit{Grundy packing chromatic number}, analogous to the Grundy chromatic number of a graph. We first present a polynomial-time algorithm that is based on a greedy approach and gives a packing coloring of $G$. We then define the Grundy packing chromatic number $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum value that this algorithm yields in a graph $G$. We present several properties of $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$, provide results on the complexity of the problem as well as bounds and some exact results for $\Gamma_{\rho}(G)$.</description>

      <title>On asymptotically tight bound for the conflict-free chromatic index of nearly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ which does not contain isolated vertices. An edge coloring $c$ of $G$ is called conflict-free if each edge's closed neighborhood includes a uniquely colored element. The least number of colors admitting such $c$ is called the conflict-free chromatic index of $G$ and denoted $\chi'_{\rm CF}(G)$. It is known that in general $\chi'_{\rm CF}(G)\leq 3 \lceil \log_2\Delta \rceil+1$, while there is a family of graphs, e.g. the complete graphs, for which $\chi'_{\rm CF}(G)\geq (1-o(1))\log_2\Delta$. In the present paper we provide the asymptotically tight upper bound $\chi'_{\rm CF}(G)\leq (1+o(1))\log_2\Delta$ for regular and nearly regular graphs, which in particular implies that the same bound holds a.a.s. for a random graph $G=G(n,p)$ whenever $p\gg n^{-\varepsilon}$ for any fixed constant $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof is probabilistic and exploits classic results of Hall and Berge. This was inspired by our approach utilized in the particular case of complete graphs, for which we give a more specific upper bound. We also observe that almost the same bounds hold in the open neighborhood regime.</description>

      <title>Self-Reachable Chip Configurations on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the notion of a \emph{self-reachable} chip configuration on a simple graph, that is a chip configuration which can be re-obtained from itself after a (nonempty) sequence of vertex firings. In particular, we focus on the case of trees and provide a characterization for such configurations, as well as show that all self-reachable configurations with the same number of chips on a tree are reachable from one another. We conclude with a recursive enumeration formula for the number of self-reachable configurations.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of the independence polynomials of $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph if $n\geq p$ and every $p$ pairwise disjoint independent sets of $G$ are contained within $p$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. In this paper, we establish that every $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is $p$-quasi-regularizable if and only if $n\geq (p+1)\alpha $, where $\alpha $ is the independence number of $G$. This finding ensures that the independence polynomial of a connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is log-concave whenever $(p+1)\alpha \leq n\leq 2p\alpha +p+1$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the independence polynomial of the clique corona $G\circ K_{p}$ is invariably log-concave for all $p\geq 1$. As an application, we validate a long-standing conjecture claiming that the independence polynomial of a very well-covered graph is unimodal.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 4-dimensional Space with a Set of 4 Polyhypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Greenfeld and Tao disproof the conjecture that translational tilings of a single tile can always be periodic [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper shows that translational tiling of the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $5$ polycubes is undecidable. By introducing a technique that lifts a set of polycubes and its tiling from $3$-dimensional space to $4$-dimensional space, we manage to show that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of $4$ tiles is undecidable. This is a step towards the attempt to settle the conjecture of the undecidability of translational tiling of the $n$-dimensional space with a monotile, for some fixed $n$.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the number of edges in DP-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-critical (list $k$-critical, DP $k$-critical) if $\chi(G)= k$ ($\chi_\ell(G)= k$, $\chi_\mathrm{DP}(G)= k$) and for every proper subgraph $G'$ of $G$, $\chi(G')&lt;k$ ($\chi_\ell(G')&lt; k$, $\chi_\mathrm{DP}(G')&lt;k$). Let $f(n, k)$ ($f_\ell(n, k), f_\mathrm{DP}(n,k)$) denote the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $k$-critical (list $k$-critical, DP $k$-critical) graph. Our main result is that if $k\geq 5$ and $n\geq k+2$, then $$f_\mathrm{DP}(n,k)&gt;\left(k - 1 + \left \lceil \frac{k^2 - 7}{2k-7} \right \rceil^{-1}\right)\frac{n}{2}.$$ This is the first bound on $f_\mathrm{DP}(n,k)$ that is asymptotically better than the well-known bound on $f(n,k)$ by Gallai from 1963. The result also yields a slightly better bound on $f_{\ell}(n,k)$ than the ones known before.</description>

      <title>Schur-positivity for generalized nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is Schur-positive if its chromatic symmetric function expands nonnegatively in the Schur basis. All claw-free graphs are conjectured to be Schur-positive. We introduce a combinatorial object corresponding to a graph G, called a special rim hook G-tabloid, which is a variation on the special rim hook tabloid. These objects can be employed to compute any Schur coefficient of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph. We construct sign-reversing maps on these special rim hook G-tabloids to obtain a recurrence relation for the Schur coefficients of a family of claw-free graphs called generalized nets, then we prove the entire family is Schur-positive. We subsequently determine an analogous recurrence relation for another, similar family of claw-free graphs. Thus, we demonstrate a new method for proving Schur-positivity of chromatic symmetric functions, which has the potential to be applied to make further progress toward the aforementioned conjecture.</description>

      <title>On forbidden configurations in point-line incidence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Szemer\'edi--Trotter theorem states that the maximum number of incidences between $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane is $O(n^{4/3})$, which is asymptotically tight. Solymosi (2005) conjectured that for any set of points $P_0$ and for any set of lines $\mathcal{L}_0$ in the plane, the maximum number of incidences between $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane whose incidence graph does not contain the incidence graph of $(P_0,\mathcal{L}_0)$ is $o(n^{4/3})$. This conjecture is mentioned in the book of Brass, Moser, and Pach (2005). Even a stronger conjecture, which states that the bound can be improved to $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(P_0,\mathcal{L}_0)&gt;0$, was introduced by Mirzaei and Suk (2021). We disprove both of these conjectures. We also introduce a new approach for proving the upper bound $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ on the number of incidences for configurations $(P,\mathcal{L})$ that avoid certain subconfigurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Tur\'an number $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ of $H$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph which does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Ghosh, Gy\H{o}ri, Paulos and Xiao initiated the topic of the planar Tur\'an number for double stars. In this paper, we prove that $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,S_{2,4})\leq \frac{31}{14}n$ for $n\geq 1$, and show that equality holds for infinitely many integers $n$.</description>

      <title>Extending the science fiction and the Loehr--Warrington formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Macdonald piece polynomial $\operatorname{I}_{\mu,\lambda,k}[X;q,t]$, which is a vast generalization of the Macdonald intersection polynomial in the science fiction conjecture by Bergeron and Garsia. We demonstrate a remarkable connection between $\operatorname{I}_{\mu,\lambda,k}$, $\nabla s_{\lambda}$, and the Loehr--Warrington formula $\operatorname{LW}_{\lambda}$, thereby obtaining the Loehr--Warrington conjecture as a corollary. To connect $\operatorname{I}_{\mu,\lambda,k}$ and $\nabla s_{\lambda}$, we employ the plethystic formula for the Macdonald polynomials of Garsia--Haiman--Tesler, and to connect $\operatorname{I}_{\mu,\lambda,k}$ and $\operatorname{LW}_{\lambda}$, we use our new findings on the combinatorics of $P$-tableaux together with the column exchange rule. We also present an extension of the science fiction conjecture and the Macdonald positivity by exploiting $\operatorname{I}_{\mu,\lambda,k}$.</description>

Abstract: For given linear action of a finite group on a lattice and a positive integer q, we prove that the mod q permutation representation is a quasi-polynomial in q. Additionally, we establish several results that can be considered as mod q-analogues of results by Stapledon for equivariant Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. We also prove a reciprocity-type result for multiplicities of irreducible decompositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $L(d,1)$-labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment of nonnegative integers to the vertices such that adjacent vertices receive labels that differ by at least $d$ and those at a distance of two receive labels that differ by at least one, where $d\geq 1$. Let $\lambda^d_1 (G)$ denote the least $\lambda$ such that $G$ admits an $L(d,1)$-labeling using labels from $\{0,1,\ldots , \lambda \}$. We prove that $\lambda^d_1(X)\leq 2d+2$ for certain direct graph bundle $X= C_m\times^{\sigma_\ell} C_n$ and certain Cartesian graph bundle $X= C_m\Box^{\sigma_\ell} C_n$, where $\sigma_\ell$ is a cyclic $\ell$-shift, with equality if $1\leq d\leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any large $n$, there exists a set of $n$ points in the plane with $O(n^2/\sqrt{\log n})$ distinct distances, such that any four points in the set determine at least five distinct distances. This answers (in the negative) a question of Erd\H{o}s. The proof combines an analysis by Dumitrescu of forbidden four-point patterns with an algebraic construction of Thiele and Dumitrescu (to eliminate parallelograms), as well as a randomized transformation of that construction (to eliminate most other forbidden patterns).</description>

Abstract: We look at curvatures that are supported on k-dimensional parts of a simplicial complex G. These curvature all satisfy the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, provided that the k-dimensional simplices cover $G$. Each of these curvatures can be written as an expectation of Poincare-Hopf indices. Linear or non-linear wave dynamics with discrete or continuous time allow to deform these curvatures while keeping the Gauss-Bonnet property.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $\lambda_2(G)$ denote the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. We determine the extremal trees with maximum/minimum adjacency eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ in the class $\mathcal{T}(n,d)$ of $n$-vertex trees with diameter $d$. This contributes to the literature on $\lambda_2$-extremization over different graph families. We also revisit the notion of the spectral center of a tree and the proof of $\lambda_2$ maximization over trees.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal Ramsey numbers for slowly growing hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $F$ and a positive integer $n$, the Ramsey number $r(F,n)$ denotes the minimum $N$ such that every $N$-vertex $F$-free $k$-uniform hypergraph contains an independent set of $n$ vertices. A hypergraph is $\textit{slowly growing}$ if there is an ordering $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_t$ of its edges such that $|e_i \setminus \bigcup_{j = 1}^{i - 1}e_j| \leq 1$ for each $i \in \{2, \ldots, t\}$. We prove that if $k \geq 3$ is fixed and $F$ is any non $k$-partite slowly growing $k$-uniform hypergraph, then for $n\ge2$, \[ r(F,n) = \Omega\Bigl(\frac{n^k}{(\log n)^{2k - 2}}\Bigr).\] In particular, we deduce that the off-diagonal Ramsey number $r(F_5,n)$ is of order $n^{3}/\mbox{polylog}(n)$, where $F_5$ is the triple system $\{123, 124, 345\}$. This is the only 3-uniform Berge triangle for which the polynomial power of its off-diagonal Ramsey number was not previously known. Our constructions use pseudorandom graphs, martingales, and hypergraph containers.</description>

Abstract: Let $S_r(p,q)$ be the $r$-associated Stirling numbers of the second kind, the number of ways to partition a set of size $p$ into $q$ subsets of size at least $r$. For $r=1$, these are the standard Stirling numbers of the second kind, and for $r=2$, these are also known as the Ward Numbers. This paper concerns asymptotic expansions of these Stirling numbers; such expansions have been known for many years. However, while uniform convergence of these expansions was conjectured in Hennecart's 1994 paper, it has not been fully proved. A recent paper (Connamacher and Dobrosotskaya, 2020) went a long way, by proving uniform convergence on a large set. In this paper we build on that paper and prove convergence "everywhere."</description>

      <title>Bipartite graphs are $(\frac{4}{5}-\varepsilon) \frac{\Delta}{\log \Delta}$-choosable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alon and Krivelevich conjectured that if $G$ is a bipartite graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, then the choosability (or list chromatic number) of $G$ satisfies $\chi_{\ell}(G) = O \left ( \log \Delta \right )$. Currently, the best known upper bound for $\chi_{\ell}(G)$ is $(1 + o(1)) \frac{\Delta}{\log \Delta}$, which also holds for the much larger class of triangle-free graphs. We prove that for $\varepsilon = 10^{-3}$, every bipartite graph $G$ of sufficiently large maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\chi_{\ell}(G) &lt; (\frac{4}{5} -\varepsilon) \frac{\Delta}{\log \Delta}$. This improved upper bound suggests that list coloring is fundamentally different for bipartite graphs than for triangle-free graphs and hence gives a step toward solving the conjecture of Alon and Krivelevich.</description>

      <title>Parity statistics on restricted permutations and the Catalan--Schett polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Kitaev and Zhang's recent work on non-overlapping ascents in stack-sortable permutations and Dumont's permutation interpretation of the Jacobi elliptic functions, we investigate some parity statistics on restricted permutations. Some new related bijections are constructed and two refinements of the generating function for descents over $321$-avoiding permutations due to Barnabei, Bonetti and Silimbanian are obtained. In particular, an open problem of Kitaev and Zhang about non-overlapping ascents on $321$-avoiding permutations is solved and several combinatorial interpretations for the Catalan--Schett polynomials are found. The stack-sortable permutations are at the heart of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Uniquely colorable hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph is uniquely $k$-colorable if there exists exactly one partition of its vertex set into $k$ parts such that every edge contains at most one vertex from each part. For integers $k \ge r \ge 2$, let $\Phi_{k,r}$ denote the minimum real number such that every $n$-vertex $k$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with positive codegree greater than $\Phi_{k,r} \cdot n$ and no isolated vertices is uniquely $k$-colorable. A classic result by of Bollob\'{a}s\cite{Bol78} established that $\Phi_{k,2} = \frac{3k-5}{3k-2}$ for every $k \ge 2$.
  We consider the uniquely colorable problem for hypergraphs. Our main result determines the precise value of $\Phi_{k,r}$ for all $k \ge r \ge 3$. In particular, we show that $\Phi_{k,r}$ exhibits a phase transition at approximately $k = \frac{4r-2}{3}$, a phenomenon not seen in the graph case. As an application of the main result, combined with a classic theorem by Frankl--F\"{u}redi--Kalai, we derive general bounds for the analogous problem on minimum positive $i$-degrees for all $1\leq i&lt;r$, which are tight for infinitely many cases.</description>

      <title>Subgraph-universal planar graphs for trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists an outerplanar graph on $O(n^{c})$ vertices for $c = \log_2(3+\sqrt{10}) \approx 2.623$ that contains every tree on $n$ vertices as a subgraph. This extends a result of Chung and Graham from 1983 who showed that there exist (non-planar) $n$-vertex graphs with $O(n \log n)$ edges that contain all trees on $n$ vertices as subgraphs and a result from Gol'dberg and Livshits from 1968 who showed that there exists a universal tree for $n$-vertex trees on $n^{O(\log(n))}$ vertices.
  Furthermore, we determine the number of vertices needed in the worst case for a planar graph to contain three given trees as subgraph to be on the order of $\frac{3}{2}n$, even if the three trees are caterpillars. This answers a question recently posed by Alecu et al. in 2024.
  Lastly, we investigate (outer)planar graphs containing all (outer)planar graphs as subgraph, determining exponential lower bounds in both cases. We also construct a planar graph on $n^{O(\log(n))}$ vertices containing all $n$-vertex outerplanar graphs as subgraphs.</description>

      <title>The complexity of recognizing $ABAB$-free hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of geometric hypergraphs gave rise to the notion of $ABAB$-free hypergraphs. A hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is called $ABAB$-free if there is an ordering of its vertices such that there are no hyperedges $A,B$ and vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ in this order satisfying $v_1,v_3\in A\setminus B$ and $v_2,v_4\in B\setminus A$. In this paper, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide if a hypergraph is $ABAB$-free. We show a number of analogous results for hypergraphs with similar forbidden patterns, such as $ABABA$-free hypergraphs. As an application, we show that deciding whether a hypergraph is realizable as the incidence hypergraph of points and pseudodisks is also NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On fractional matching extendability of Cayley graphs of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional matching extendability is a concept that brings together two widely studied topics in graph theory, namely that of fractional matchings and that of matching extendability. A {\em fractional matching} of a graph $\Gamma$ with edge set $E$ is a function $f$ from $E$ to the real interval $[0,1]$ with the property that for each vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$ the sum of the $f$-values of all the edges incident to $v$ is at most $1$. When this sum equals $1$ for each vertex $v$, the fractional matching is {\em perfect}. A graph of order at least $2t+1$ is {\em fractional $t$-extendable} if it contains a matching of size $t$ and if each such matching $M$ can be extended to a fractional perfect matching in the sense that the corresponding function $f$ assigns the value $1$ to each edge of $M$.
  In this paper we study fractional matching extendability of Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. We show that with the obvious exceptions of cycles of odd length all connected Cayley graphs of Abelian groups are fractional $1$-extendable and we classify the fractional $2$-extendable Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. This extends the classification of $2$-extendable (in the classical sense) connected Cayley graphs of Abelian groups of even order from 1995 obtained by Chan, Chen and Yu.</description>

      <title>Intersection Graphs with and without Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ admits product structure if there exists a constant $k$ such that every $G \in \mathcal{G}$ is a subgraph of $H \boxtimes P$ for a path $P$ and some graph $H$ of treewidth $k$. Famously, the class of planar graphs, as well as many beyond-planar graph classes are known to admit product structure. However, we have only few tools to prove the absence of product structure, and hence know of only a few interesting examples of classes. Motivated by the transition between product structure and no product structure, we investigate subclasses of intersection graphs in the plane (e.g., disk intersection graphs) and present necessary and sufficient conditions for these to admit product structure. Specifically, for a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (e.g., a disk) and a real number $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we consider intersection graphs of $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$. That is, each vertex $v$ is a homothetic copy of $S$ of which at least an $\alpha$-portion is not covered by other vertices, and there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ if and only if $u \cap v \neq \emptyset$. For $\alpha = 1$ we have contact graphs, which are in most cases planar, and hence admit product structure. For $\alpha = 0$ we have (among others) all complete graphs, and hence no product structure. In general, there is a threshold value $\alpha^*(S) \in [0,1]$ such that $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$ admit product structure for all $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*(S)$ and do not admit product structure for all $\alpha &lt; \alpha^*(S)$. We show for a large family of sets $S$, including all triangles and all trapezoids, that it holds $\alpha^*(S) = 1$, i.e., we have no product structure, except for the contact graphs (when $\alpha= 1$). For other sets $S$, including regular $n$-gons for infinitely many values of $n$, we show that $0 &lt; \alpha^*(S) &lt; 1$ by proving upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Improving the Crossing Lemma by Characterizing Dense 2-Planar and 3-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Crossing Lemma by Ajtai et al.~and Leighton from 1982 gave an important lower bound of $c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ for the number of crossings in any drawing of a given graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The original value was $c= 1/100$, which then has gradually been improved. Here, the bounds for the density of $k$-planar graphs played a central role. Our new insight is that for $k=2,3$ the $k$-planar graphs have substantially fewer edges if specific local configurations that occur in drawings of $k$-planar graphs of maximum density are forbidden. Therefore, we are able to derive better bounds for the crossing number $\text{cr}(G)$ of a given graph $G$. In particular, we achieve a bound of $\text{cr}(G) \ge \frac{73}{18}m-\frac{305}{18}(n-2)$ for the range of $5n &lt; m \le 6n$, while our second bound $\text{cr}(G) \ge 5m - \frac{407}{18}(n-2)$ is even stronger for larger $m&gt;6n$.
  For $m &gt; 6.79n$, we finally apply the standard probabilistic proof from the BOOK and obtain an improved constant of $c&gt;1/27.61$ in the Crossing Lemma. Note that the previous constant was $1/29$. Although this improvement is not too impressive, we consider our technique as an important new tool, which might be helpful in various other applications.</description>

      <title>On S-Packing Coloring of Subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)$ of positive integers with $s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \ldots \leq s_k$, an $S$-packing coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$ the distance between any two distinct $x, y \in V_i$ is at least $s_i + 1$. In 2023, Yang and Wu proved that all 3-irregular subcubic graphs are $(1,1,3)$-packing colorable. In 2024, Mortada and Togni proved that every 1-saturated subcubic graph is $(1, 1, 2)$-packing colorable. In this paper, we provide new, concise proofs for these two theorems using a novel tool.</description>

      <title>An exploration of the balance game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance game is played on a graph $G$ by two players, Admirable (A) and Impish (I), who take turns selecting unlabeled vertices of $G$. Admirable labels the selected vertices by $0$ and Impish by $1$, and the resulting label on any edge is the sum modulo $2$ of the labels of the vertices incident to that edge. Let $e_0$ and $e_1$ denote the number of edges labeled by $0$ and $1$ after all the vertices are labeled. The discrepancy in the balance game is defined as $d = e_1 - e_0$. The two players have opposite goals: Admirable attempts to minimize the discrepancy $d$ while Impish attempts to maximize $d$. When (A) makes the first move in the game, the (A)-start game balance number, $b^A_g(G)$, is the value of $d$ when both players play optimally, and when (I) makes the first move in the game, the (I)-start game balance number, $b^I_g(G)$, is the value of $d$ when both players play optimally. Among other results, we show that if $G$ has order $n$, then $-\log_2(n) \le b^A_g(G) \le \frac{n}{2}$ if $n$ is even and $0 \le b^A_g(G) \le \frac{n}{2} + \log_2(n)$ if $n$ is odd. Moreover we show that $b^A_g(G) + b^I_g(\overline{G}) = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <title>Online Ramsey numbers of ordered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online ordered Ramsey game is played between two players, Builder and Painter, on an infinite sequence of vertices with ordered graphs $(G_1,G_2)$, which have linear orderings on their vertices. On each turn, Builder first selects an edge before Painter colors it red or blue. Builder's objective is to construct either an ordered red copy of $G_1$ or an ordered blue copy of $G_2$, while Painter's objective is to delay this for as many turns as possible. The online ordered Ramsey number $r_o(G_1,G_2)$ is the number of turns Builder takes to win in the case that both players play optimally.
  Few lower bounds are known for this quantity. In this paper, we introduce a succinct proof of a new lower bound based on the maximum left- and right-degrees in the ordered graphs. We also upper bound $r_o(G_1,G_2)$ in two cases: when $G_1$ is a cycle and $G_2$ a complete bipartite graph, and when $G_1$ is a tree and $G_2$ a clique.</description>

Abstract: Due to their elegant and simple nature, unitary Cayley graphs have been an active research topic in the literature. These graphs are naturally connected to several branches of mathematics, including number theory, finite algebra, representation theory, and graph theory. In this article, we study the perfectness property of these graphs. More precisely, we provide a complete classification of perfect unitary Cayley graphs associated with finite rings.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma=(K_n,H)$ be a signed complete graph whose negative edges induce a subgraph $H$. Let $A(\Gamma)$ be the adjacency matrix of the signed graph $\Gamma$. The largest eigenvalue of $A(\Gamma)$ is called the index of $\Gamma$. In this paper, the index of all the signed complete graphs whose negative edges induce a bicyclic graph $B$ is investigated. Specifically, the structure of the bicyclic graph $B$ such that $\Gamma=(K_n,B)$ has the maximum index is determined.</description>

Abstract: Let $W$ be a simply laced Weyl group of finite type and rank $n$. If $W$ has type $E_7$, $E_8$, or $D_n$ for $n$ even, then the root system of $W$ has subsystems of type $nA_1$. This gives rise to an irreducible Macdonald representation of $W$ spanned by $n$-roots, which are products of $n$ orthogonal roots in the symmetric algebra of the reflection representation. We prove that in these cases, the set of all maximal sets of orthogonal positive roots has the structure of a quasiparabolic set in the sense of Rains--Vazirani. The quasiparabolic structure can be described in terms of certain quadruples of orthogonal positive roots which we call crossings, nestings, and alignments. This leads to nonnesting and noncrossing bases for the Macdonald representation, as well as some highly structured partially ordered sets. We use the $8$-roots in type $E_8$ to give a concise description of a graph that is known to be non-isomorphic but quantum isomorphic to the orthogonality graph of the $E_8$ root system.</description>

      <title>Coverings of Groups, Regular Dessins, and Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coset geometry representation of regular dessins is established, and employed to describe quotients and coverings of regular dessins and surfaces. A characterization is then given of face-quasiprimitive regular dessins as coverings of unicellular regular dessins. It shows that there are exactly three O'Nan-Scott-Praeger types of face-quasiprimitive regular dessins which are smooth coverings of unicellular regular dessins, leading to new constructions of interesting families of regular dessins. Finally, a problem of determining smooth Schur covering of simple groups is initiated by studying coverings between $\SL(2,p)$ and $\PSL(2,p)$, giving rise to interesting regular dessins like Fibonacci coverings.</description>

      <title>All trees on $n$ edges decompose $K_{n,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Graham and H\"aggkvist (1989), which states that any tree on $n$ edges decomposes the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$. We do so by translating the decomposition problem into a labeling problem, namely $\vec{\beta}$-labeling (oriented beta-labeling). Our proof employs the polynomial method using a functional reformulation of the conjecture. We also introduce additional algebraic properties that the decomposition grants. A proof of the graceful tree conjecture (1967) follows as an immediate consequence of the current result.</description>

      <title>The $n$-Color Partition Function and Some Counting Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Merca and Schmidt found some decompositions for the partition function $p(n)$ in terms of the classical M\"{o}bius function as well as Euler's totient. In this paper, we define a counting function $T_k^r(m)$ on the set of $n$-color partitions of $m$ for given positive integers $k, r$ and relate the function with the $n$-color partition function and other well-known arithmetic functions like the M\"obius function, Liouville function, etc. and their divisor sums. Furthermore, we use a counting method of Erd\"os to obtain some counting theorems for $n$-color partitions that are analogous to those found by Andrews and Deutsch for the partition function.</description>

Abstract: By inventing the notion of honeycombs, A. Knutson and T. Tao proved the saturation conjecture for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The Newell-Littlewood numbers are a generalization of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

      <description>arXiv:2409.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a higher-dimensional analogue of the {Random Travelling Salesman Problem}: let the complete $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K_n^{d}$ on $n$ vertices be equipped with i.i.d.\ volumes on its facets, uniformly random in $[0,1]$. What is the minimum volume $M_{n,d}$ of a sub-complex homeomorphic to the $d$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, containing all vertices? We determine the growth rate of $M_{n,2}$, and prove that it is well-concentrated. For $d&gt;2$ we prove such results to the extent that current knowledge about the number of triangulations of $\mathbb{S}^d$ allows.
  We remark that this can be thought of as a model of random geometry in the spirit of Angel \&amp; Schramm's UIPT, and provide a generalised framework that interpolates between our model and the uniform random triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^d$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the second class particle in half-line open TASEP under two different initial conditions with shock discontinuities. The exact formulas for the distribution of the second class particle can be derived by using the color-position symmetry theorem of colored half-space TASEP. We study the asymptotic distribution of second class particles under the constant scaling and KPZ-type scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The immaculate Hecke poset was introduced and investigated by Niese, Sundaram, van Willigenburg, Vega and Wang, who established the full poset structure, and determined modules for the 0-Hecke algebra action on immaculate and row-strict immaculate tableaux.
  In this paper, we extend their results by introducing the skew immaculate Hecke poset. We investigate the poset structure, and construct modules for the 0-Hecke algebra action on skew immaculate and skew row-strict immaculate tableaux, thus showing that the skew immaculate Hecke poset captures representation-theoretic information analogous to the immaculate Hecke poset. We also describe branching rules for the resulting skew modules.</description>

      <title>A superpotential for Grassmannian Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While mirror symmetry for flag varieties and Grassmannians has been extensively studied, Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian are singular, and hence standard mirror symmetry statements are not well-defined. Nevertheless, in this article we introduce a ``superpotential'' $W^{\lambda}$ for each Grassmannian Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$, generalizing the Marsh-Rietsch superpotential for Grassmannians, and we show that $W^{\lambda}$ governs many toric degenerations of $X_{\lambda}$. We also generalize the ``polytopal mirror theorem'' for Grassmannians from our previous work: namely, for any cluster seed $G$ for $X_{\lambda}$, we construct a corresponding Newton-Okounkov convex body $\Delta_G^{\lambda}$, and show that it coincides with the superpotential polytope $\Gamma_G^{\lambda}$, that is, it is cut out by the inequalities obtained by tropicalizing an associated Laurent expansion of $W^{\lambda}$. This gives us a toric degeneration of the Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$ to the (singular) toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ of the Newton-Okounkov body. Finally, for a particular cluster seed $G=G^\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ we show that the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ has a small toric desingularisation, and we describe an intermediate partial desingularisation $Y(\mathcal{F}_\lambda)$ that is Gorenstein Fano. Many of our results extend to more general varieties in the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries and the Cohen--Lenstra distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the cokernels of random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries. Let $X_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ in which some entries are fixed to be zero and the other entries are i.i.d. copies of a random variable $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. We consider the minimal number of random entries of $X_n$ required for the cokernel of $X_n$ to converge to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution. When $\xi$ is given by the Haar measure, we prove a lower bound of the number of random entries and prove its converse-type result using random regular bipartite multigraphs. When $\xi$ is a general random variable, we determine the minimal number of random entries. Let $M_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $k$-step stairs of zeros and the other entries given by independent random $\epsilon$-balanced variables valued in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We prove that the cokernel of $M_n$ converges to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution under a mild assumption. This extends Wood's universality theorem on random $p$-adic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent investigations indicate that for the classification of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals, it suffices to consider biconnected graphs with some whiskers attached (in short, `block with whiskers'). This paper provides explicit combinatorial formulae for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of two specific classes of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals: (i) chain of cycles with whiskers and (ii) $r$-regular $r$-connected block with whiskers. For the first type, we introduce a new invariant of graphs in terms of the number of blocks in certain induced block graphs, and this invariant may help determine the regularity of other classes of binomial edge ideals. For the second type, we present the formula as a linear function of $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant to show that if $P$ and $Q$ are two real polynomials, any real function of the form $x^\alpha(1-x)^{\beta} P - Q$, has at most $\deg P +\deg Q + 2$ roots in the interval $]0,~1[$. As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the number of positive solutions to a real polynomial system $f=g=0$ in two variables where $f$ has three monomials terms, and $g$ has $t$ terms. The approach we adopt for tackling this Fewnomial bound relies on the theory of Wronskians, which was used in Koiran et.\ al.\ (J.\ Symb.\ Comput., 2015) for producing the first upper bound which is polynomial in $t$.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graphon is the limit of a converging graph sequence. Graphons of dense graphs are useful as they can act as a blueprint and generate graphs of arbitrary size with similar properties. But for sparse graphs this is not the case. Sparse graphs converge to the zero graphon, making the generated graphs empty or edgeless. Thus, the classical graphon definition fails for sparse graphs. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation and to understand sparse graphs more deeply. However, the fragile nature of sparse graphs makes these methods mathematically complex. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a certain subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. Line graphs map edges to vertices and connects edges when edges in the original graph share a vertex. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>Record-biased permutations and their permuton limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a non-uniform distribution on permutations biased by their number of records that we call \emph{record-biased permutations}. We give several generative processes for record-biased permutations, explaining also how they can be used to devise efficient (linear) random samplers. For several classical permutation statistics, we obtain their expectation using the above generative processes, as well as their limit distributions in the regime that has a logarithmic number of records (as in the uniform case). Finally, increasing the bias to obtain a regime with an expected linear number of records, we establish the convergence of record-biased permutations to a deterministic permuton, which we fully characterize.
  This model was introduced in our earlier work [N. Auger, M. Bouvel, C. Nicaud, C. Pivoteau, \emph{Analysis of Algorithms for Permutations Biased by Their Number of Records}, AofA 2016], in the context of realistic analysis of algorithms. We conduct here a more thorough study but with a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>The $m$-th Element of a Sidon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 35 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Jha (arXiv:2007.04243, arXiv:2011.11038) has found identities that connect certain sums over the divisors of $n$ to the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of squares and triangular numbers. In this note, we state a generalized result that gives such relations for $s$-gonal numbers for any integer $s\geq3$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Gireesh, Ray, and Shivashankar studied an analog, $\overline{a}_t(n)$, of the $t$-core partition function, $c_t(n)$. In this paper, we study the function $\overline{a}_5(n)$ in conjunction with $c_5(n)$ as well as another analogous function $\overline{b}_5(n)$. We also find several arithmetic identities for $\overline{a}_5(n)$ and $\overline{b}_5(n)$.</description>

      <title>A note on the random greedy independent set algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3732</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.3732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let r be a fixed constant and let H be an r-uniform, D-regular hypergraph on N vertices. Assume further that D &gt; N^\epsilon for some \epsilon&gt;0. Consider the random greedy algorithm for forming an independent set in H. An independent set is chosen at random by iteratively choosing vertices at random to be in the independent set. At each step we choose a vertex uniformly at random from the collection of vertices that could be added to the independent set (i.e. the collection of vertices v with the property that v is not in the current independent set I and I \cup {v} contains no edge of H). Note that this process terminates at a maximal subset of vertices with the property that this set contains no edge of H; that is, the process terminates at a maximal independent set. We prove that if H satisfies certain degree and codegree conditions then there are \Omega(N ((log N) / D)^{1/(r-1)}) vertices in the independent set produced by the random greedy algorithm with high probability. This result generalizes a lower bound on the number of steps in the H-free process due to Bohman and Keevash and produces objects of interest in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Hopf monoids of ordered simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pure ordered simplicial complexes (i.e., simplicial complexes with a linear order on their ground sets) from the Hopf-theoretic point of view. We define a \textit{Hopf class} to be a family of pure ordered simplicial complexes that give rise to a Hopf monoid under join and deletion/contraction. The prototypical Hopf class is the family of ordered matroids. The idea of a Hopf class allows us to give a systematic study of simplicial complexes related to matroids, including shifted complexes, broken-circuit complexes, and \textit{unbounded matroids} (which arise from unbounded generalized permutohedra with 0/1 coordinates).
  We compute the antipodes in two cases: \textit{facet-initial complexes} (a much larger class than shifted complexes) and unbounded ordered matroids. In the latter case, we embed the Hopf monoid of ordered matroids into the Hopf monoid of ordered generalized permutohedra, enabling us to compute the antipode using the topological method of Aguiar and Ardila. The calculation is complicated by the appearance of certain auxiliary simplicial complexes that we call \textit{Scrope complexes}, whose Euler characteristics control certain coefficients of the antipode. The resulting antipode formula is multiplicity-free and cancellation-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that every $O(m)$-edge-connected simple graph $G$ of size divisible by $m$ with minimum degree at least $2^{O(m)}$ has an edge-decomposition into isomorphic copies of any given tree $T$ of size $m$. Moreover, the minimum degree condition can be dropped for graphs $G$ with girth greater than the diameter of $T$. These results improve two results due to Bensmail, Harutyunyan, Le, Merker, and Thomass\'e (2017) and Merker (2017) who gave a factorial upper bound on the necessary edge-connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we consider a graph process recently introduced by Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli. In their model, the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are ordered uniformly at random and are then revealed consecutively to a player called Builder. At every round, Builder must decide if they accept the edge proposed at this round or not. We prove that, for every $d\ge 2$, Builder can construct a spanning $d$-connected graph after $(1+o(1))n\log n/2$ rounds by accepting $(1+o(1))dn/2$ edges with probability converging to 1 as $n\to \infty$. This settles a conjecture of Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli.</description>

      <title>Lozenge Tilings of Hexagons with Intrusions I: Generalized Intrusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MacMahon's classical theorem on the number of boxed plane partitions has been generalized in several directions. One way to generalize the theorem is to view boxed plane partitions as lozenge tilings of a hexagonal region and then generalize it by making some holes in the region and counting its tilings. In this paper, we provide new regions whose numbers of lozenges tilings are given by simple product formulas. The regions we consider can be obtained from hexagons by removing structures called intrusions. In fact, we show that the tiling generating functions of those regions under certain weights are given by similar formulas. These give the $q$-analogue of the enumeration results.</description>

      <title>Continued fractions for cycle-alternating permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutation is said to be cycle-alternating if it has no cycle double rises, cycle double falls or fixed points; thus each index $i$ is either a cycle valley ($\sigma^{-1}(i)&gt;i&lt;\sigma(i)$) or a cycle peak ($\sigma^{-1}(i)&lt;i&gt;\sigma(i)$). We find Stieltjes-type continued fractions for some multivariate polynomials that enumerate cycle-alternating permutations with respect to a large (sometimes infinite) number of simultaneous statistics that measure cycle status, record status, crossings and nestings along with the parity of the indices. Our continued fractions are specializations of more general continued fractions of Sokal and Zeng. We then introduce alternating Laguerre digraphs, which are generalization of cycle-alternating permutations, and find exponential generating functions for some polynomials enumerating them. We interpret the Stieltjes--Rogers and Jacobi--Rogers matrices associated to some of our continued fractions in terms of alternating Laguerre digraphs.</description>

      <title>Powers of planar graphs, product structure, and blocking partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $k$-power of any planar graph $G$ is contained in $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_{f(\Delta(G),k)}$ for some graph $H$ with bounded treewidth, some path $P$, and some function $f$. This resolves an open problem of Ossona de Mendez. In fact, we prove a more general result in terms of shallow minors that implies similar results for many `beyond planar' graph classes, without dependence on $\Delta(G)$. For example, we prove that every $k$-planar graph is contained in $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_{f(k)}$ for some graph $H$ with bounded treewidth and some path $P$, and some function $f$. This resolves an open problem of Dujmovi\'c, Morin and Wood. We generalise all these results for graphs of bounded Euler genus, still with an absolute bound on the treewidth.
  At the heart of our proof is the following new concept of independent interest. An $\ell$-blocking partition of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into connected sets such that every path of length greater than $\ell$ in $G$ contains at least two vertices in one part. We prove that for some constant $\ell \ge 1$ every graph of Euler genus $g$ has an $\ell$-blocking partition with parts of size bounded by a function of $\Delta(G)$ and $g$. Motivated by this result, we study blocking partitions in their own right. We show that every graph $G$ has a $2$-blocking partition with parts of size bounded by a function of $\Delta(G)$ and $\textrm{tw}(G)$. On the other hand, we show that 4-regular graphs do not have $\ell$-blocking partitions with bounded size parts.</description>

      <title>Optimal spread for spanning subgraphs of Dirac hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ and $H$ be hypergraphs on $n$ vertices, and suppose $H$ has large enough minimum degree to necessarily contain a copy of $G$ as a subgraph. We give a general method to randomly embed $G$ into $H$ with good "spread". More precisely, for a wide class of $G$, we find a randomised embedding $f\colon G\hookrightarrow H$ with the following property: for every $s$, for any partial embedding $f'$ of $s$ vertices of $G$ into $H$, the probability that $f$ extends $f'$ is at most $O(1/n)^s$. This is a common generalisation of several streams of research surrounding the classical Dirac-type problem. For example, setting $s=n$, we obtain an asymptotically tight lower bound on the number of embeddings of $G$ into $H$. This recovers and extends recent results of Glock, Gould, Joos, K\"uhn, and Osthus and of Montgomery and Pavez-Sign\'e regarding enumerating Hamilton cycles in Dirac hypergraphs. Moreover, using the recent developments surrounding the Kahn--Kalai conjecture, this result implies that many Dirac-type results hold robustly, meaning $G$ still embeds into $H$ after a random sparsification of its edge set. This allows us to recover a recent result of Kang, Kelly, K\"uhn, Osthus, and Pfenninger and of Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin for perfect matchings, and obtain novel results for Hamilton cycles and factors in Dirac hypergraphs. Notably, our randomised embedding algorithm is self-contained and does not require Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma or iterative absorption.</description>

      <title>Cost-sharing in Parking Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the total displacement statistic of parking functions from the perspective of cooperative game theory. We introduce parking games, which are coalitional cost-sharing games in characteristic function form derived from the total displacement statistic. We show that parking games are supermodular cost-sharing games, indicating that cooperation is difficult (i.e., their core is empty). Next, we study their Shapley value, which formalizes a notion of "fair" cost-sharing and amounts to charging each car for its expected marginal displacement under a random arrival order. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Shapley value of parking games, in contrast with known hardness results on computing the Shapley value of arbitrary games. The algorithm leverages the permutation-invariance of total displacement, combinatorial enumeration, and dynamic programming. We conclude with open questions around an alternative solution concept for supermodular cost-sharing games and connections to other areas in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>The directed Oberwolfach problem with variable cycle lengths: a recursive construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The directed Oberwolfach problem OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_k)$ asks whether the complete symmetric digraph $K_n^\ast$, assuming $n=m_1+\ldots +m_k$, admits a decomposition into spanning subdigraphs, each a disjoint union of $k$ directed cycles of lengths $m_1,\ldots,m_k$. We hereby describe a method for constructing a solution to OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_k)$ given a solution to OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_\ell)$, for some $\ell&lt;k$, if certain conditions on $m_1,\ldots,m_k$ are satisfied. This approach enables us to extend a solution for OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_\ell)$ into a solution for OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_\ell,t)$, as well as into a solution for OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_\ell,2^{\langle t \rangle})$, where $2^{\langle t \rangle}$ denotes $t$ copies of 2, provided $t$ is sufficiently large.
  In particular, our recursive construction allows us to effectively address the two-table directed Oberwolfach problem. We show that OP$^\ast(m_1,m_2)$ has a solution for all $2 \le m_1\le m_2$, with a definite exception of $m_1=m_2=3$ and a possible exception in the case that $m_1 \in \{ 4,6 \}$, $m_2$ is even, and $m_1+m_2 \ge 14$. It has been shown previously that OP$^\ast(m_1,m_2)$ has a solution if $m_1+m_2$ is odd, and that OP$^\ast(m,m)$ has a solution if and only if $m \ne 3$.
  In addition to solving many other cases of OP$^\ast$, we show that when $2 \le m_1+\ldots +m_k \le 13$, OP$^\ast(m_1,\ldots,m_k)$ has a solution if and only if $(m_1,\ldots,m_k) \not\in \{ (4),(6),(3,3) \}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following question by Balister, Gy\H{o}ri and Schelp: given $2^{n-1}$ nonzero vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ with zero sum, is it always possible to partition the elements of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ into pairs such that the difference between the two elements of the $i$-th pair is equal to the $i$-th given vector for every $i$? An analogous question in $\mathbb{F}_p$, which is a case of the so-called "seating couples" problem, has been resolved by Preissmann and Mischler in 2009. In this paper, we prove the conjecture in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ in the case when the number of distinct values among the given difference vectors is at most $n-2\log n-1$, and also in the case when at least a fraction $\frac12+\varepsilon$ of the given vectors are equal (for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $n$ sufficiently large based on $\varepsilon$).</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz's problem via $\epsilon$-t-nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Zarankiewicz's problem asks for the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain the complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$. In one of the cornerstones of extremal graph theory, K\H{o}v\'ari S\'os and Tur\'an proved an upper bound of $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{t}})$. In a celebrated result, Fox et al. obtained an improved bound of $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{d}})$ for graphs of VC-dimension $d$ (where $d&lt;t$). Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao and Tran improved the bound for the case of semilinear graphs. At SODA'23, Chan and Har-Peled further improved Basit et al.'s bounds and presented (quasi-)linear upper bounds for several classes of geometrically-defined incidence graphs, including a bound of $O(n \log \log n)$ for the incidence graph of points and pseudo-discs in the plane.
  In this paper we present a new approach to Zarankiewicz's problem, via $\epsilon$-t-nets - a recently introduced generalization of the classical notion of $\epsilon$-nets. We show that the existence of `small'-sized $\epsilon$-t-nets implies upper bounds for Zarankiewicz's problem. Using the new approach, we obtain a sharp bound of $O(n)$ for the intersection graph of two families of pseudo-discs, thus both improving and generalizing the result of Chan and Har-Peled from incidence graphs to intersection graphs. We also obtain a short proof of the $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{d}})$ bound of Fox et al., and show improved bounds for several other classes of geometric intersection graphs, including a sharp $O(n\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ bound for the intersection graph of two families of axis-parallel rectangles.</description>

Abstract: Let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be patterns of length three; that is $\sigma, \tau \in \{123,132,213,231,312,321\}$. In this paper, we enumerate the set of cyclic permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ that avoid $\sigma$ in their one-line notation and another pattern $\tau$ in their cycle notation.</description>

      <title>Sandpile groups for cones over trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sandpile groups are a subtle graph isomorphism invariant, in the form of a finite abelian group, whose cardinality is the number of spanning trees in the graph. We study their group structure for graphs obtained by attaching a cone vertex to a tree. For example, it is shown that the number of generators of the sandpile group is at most one less than the number of leaves in the tree. For trees on a fixed number of vertices, the paths and stars are shown to provide extreme behavior, not only for the number of generators, but also for the number of spanning trees, and for Tutte polynomial evaluations that count the recurrent sandpile configurations by their numbers of chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study half-space separation in the convexity of chordless paths of a graph, i.e., monophonic convexity. In this problem, one is given a graph and two (disjoint) subsets of vertices and asks whether these two sets can be separated by complementary convex sets, called half-spaces. While it is known this problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete for geodesic convexity -- the convexity of shortest paths -- we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for monophonic convexity.</description>

      <title>On the minimum spectral radius of connected graphs of given order and size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Hong from 1993 related to the minimum spectral radii of the adjacency matrices of connected graphs of given order and size. Hong asked if it is true that among all connected graphs of given number of vertices $n$ and number of edges $e$, the graphs having minimum spectral radius (the minimizer graphs) must be almost regular, meaning that the difference between their maximum degree and their minimum degree is at most one. In this paper, we answer Hong's question positively for various values of $n$ and $e$ and in several cases, we determined the graphs with minimum spectral radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a classic result of Gessel, the exponential generating functions for $k$-regular graphs are D-finite. Using Gr\"obner bases in Weyl algebras, we compute the linear differential equations satisfied by the generating function for 5-, 6-, and 7- regular graphs. The method is sufficiently robust to consider variants such as graphs with multiple edges, loops, and graphs whose degrees are limited to fixed sets of values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture is true if we replace the edge bound with $d + \big\lceil k \big\lfloor\frac{d-1}{k+1}\big\rfloor \big(\frac{d}{k+1} - \frac{1}{2} \big\lceil\frac{d}{k+1}\big\rceil \big)\big\rceil \leq d + \frac{k}{2} \cdot \big(\frac{d}{k+1}\big)^2$. More precisely: let $G$ be a graph, let $d$ and $k$ be positive integers and $\gamma(G) = \max_{H \subseteq G, v(H) \geq 2} \frac{e(H)}{v(H) - 1}$. If $\gamma(G) \leq k + \frac{d}{d + k + 1}$, then there is a partition of $E(G)$ into $k + 1$ forests, where in one forest every connected component has at most $d + \big\lceil k \big\lfloor\frac{d-1}{k+1}\big\rfloor \big(\frac{d}{k+1} - \frac{1}{2} \big\lceil\frac{d}{k+1}\big\rceil \big)\big\rceil$ edges.</description>

Abstract: Two players play a game by alternately splitting a surface of a compact $2$-manifold along a simple closed curve that is not null-homotopic and attaching disks to the resulting boundary; the last player who can move wins. Starting from an orientable surface, the $G$-series is $01\dot{2}\dot{0}$ according to increasing genus. Starting from a nonorientable surface, the $G$-series is $012\dot{4}60\dot{3}$ according to increasing genus. Nim addition determines the $G$-values of the remaining compact $2$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of Client-Waiter and Waiter-Client games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positional games were introduced by Hales and Jewett in 1963, and their study became more popular after Erdos and Selfridge's first result on their connection to Ramsey theory and hypergraph coloring in 1973. Several conventions of these games exist, and the most popular one, Maker-Breaker was proved to be PSPACE-complete by Schaefer in 1978. The study of their complexity then stopped for decades, until 2017 when Bonnet, Jamain, and Saffidine proved that Maker-Breaker is W[1]-complete when parameterized by the number of moves. The study was then intensified when Rahman and Watson improved Schaefer's result in 2021 by proving that the PSPACE-hardness holds for 6-uniform hypergraphs. More recently, Galliot, Gravier, and Sivignon proved that computing the winner on rank 3 hypergraphs is in P.
  We focus here on the Client-Waiter and the Waiter-Client conventions. Both were proved to be NP-hard by Csernenszky, Martin, and Pluh\'ar in 2011, but neither completeness nor positive results were known for these conventions. In this paper, we complete the study of these conventions by proving that the former is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to 6-uniform hypergraphs, and by providing an FPT-algorithm for the latter, parameterized by the size of its largest edge. In particular, the winner of Waiter-Client can be computed in polynomial time in k-uniform hypergraphs for any fixed integer k. Finally, in search of finding the exact bound between the polynomial result and the hardness result, we focused on the complexity of rank 3 hypergraphs in the Client-Waiter convention. We provide an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with an oracle in NP.</description>

Abstract: Using PET and quantitative concatenation techniques, we establish box-norm control with the "expected" directions for counting operators for general multidimensional polynomial progressions, with at most polynomial losses in the parameters. Such results are often useful first steps towards obtaining explicit upper bounds on sets lacking instances of given such progressions. In the companion paper arXiv:2407.08637, we complete this program for sets in $[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y), (x, y + P(z))$, where $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an integer root of multiplicity $1$.</description>

      <title>Corners with polynomial side length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $P$-polynomial corner, for $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ a polynomial, is a triple of points $(x,y),\; (x+P(z),y),\; (x,y+P(z))$ for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$. In the case where $P$ has an integer root of multiplicity $1$, we show that if $A \subseteq [N]^2$ does not contain any nontrivial $P$-polynomial corners, then $$|A| \ll_P \frac{N^2}{(\log\log\log N)^c}$$ for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$. This simultaneously generalizes a result of Shkredov about corner-free sets and a recent result of Peluse, Sah, and Sawhney about sets without $3$-term arithmetic progressions of common difference $z^2-1$. The main ingredients in our proof are a multidimensional quantitative concatenation result from our companion paper arXiv:2407.08636 and a novel degree-lowering argument for box norms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of almost purely operational methods in the study of umbral calculus. To accomplish this goal, we systematically reconstruct the theory operationally, offering new proofs and results throughout. Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power series, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion theorem, derive formulas for both fractional and regular compositional iterates and generalize Jabotinsky matrices. In addition, we will develop several new insights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel expressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally, we will elaborate on both established and new concepts and examples, such as pseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Analysis of natural cardinal ranking vectors for pairwise comparisons and the universal efficiency of the Perron geometric mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In models using pair-wise (ratio) comparisons among alternatives, a cardinal ranking vector should be deduced from a reciprocal matrix. The right Perron eigenvector (RP) was traditionally used, though several other options have emerged. We consider some alternatives, mostly new, namely the entry-wise reciprocal of the left Perron vector (LP), the left singular vector (LS), the entry-wise reciprocal of the right singular vector (RS), the arithmetic and geometric means of RP and LP (AP and GP), and of LS and RS (AS and GS). (The ranking vector AS was proposed by Gass and Rapcs\'ak (2004)). All 8 of these vectors produce the natural vector in the consistent case. We compare them empirically, in terms of efficiency, for random matrices, as a function of the number of alternatives. It turns out that the vector GP is universily efficient, and this fact is proven. The vector GS performs better that the remaining 6 vectors. We show that, for reciprocal matrices obtained from consistent matrices by modifying one column and the corresponding row, all 8 vectors are efficient. Moreover, the cone generated by the columns is efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past, analogies to Brooks' theorem have been found for various parameters of graph coloring for infinite locally finite connected graphs in ZFC. We prove these theorems are not provable in ZF (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). Moreover, such theorems follow from Konig's Lemma (every infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray-a weak form of AC) in ZF. In ZF, we formulate new conditions for the existence of the distinguishing chromatic number, the distinguishing chromatic index, the total chromatic number, the total distinguishing chromatic number, the odd chromatic number, and the neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally finite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma. In this direction, we strengthen a recent result of Stawiski from 2023.</description>

      <title>Homology of Segre powers of Boolean and subspace lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segre products of posets were defined by Bj\"orner and Welker [J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 198(1-3), 43--55 (2005)]. We investigate the $t$-fold Segre powers of the Boolean lattice $B_n$ and the subspace lattice $B_n(q)$. The case $t=2$ was considered by Yifei Li in [Alg. Comb. 6 (2), 457--469, 2023]. We describe how to construct an EL-labeling for the $t$-fold Segre power $P^{(t)}=P\circ \cdots \circ P$ ($t$ factors) from an EL-labeling of a pure poset $P$. We develop an extension of the product Frobenius characteristic defined by Li to examine the action of the $t$-fold direct product of the symmetric group on the homology of rank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$, giving an explicit formula for the decomposition into irreducibles for the homology of the full poset. We show that the stable principal specialisation of the associated Frobenius characteristics coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariants for the $t$-fold Segre power of the subspace lattice.</description>

      <title>On conflict-free colorings of cyclic polytopes and the girth conjecture for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conflict-free colorings for hypergraphs derived from the family of facets of $d$-dimensional cyclic polytopes. For odd dimensions $d$, the problem is fairly easy. However, for even dimensions $d$ the problem becomes very difficult. We provide sharp asymptotic bounds for the conflict-free chromatic number in all even dimensions $4\leq d \leq 20$ except for $d=16$. We also provide non-trivial upper and lower bounds for all even dimensions $d$. We exhibit a strong relation to the famous Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture in extremal graph theory which might be of independent interest for the study of conflict-free colorings. Improving the upper or lower bounds for general even dimensions $d$ would imply an improved lower or upper bound (respectively) on the Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture. Finally, we extend our result for dimension $4$ showing that the hypergraph whose hyperedges are the union of two discrete intervals from $[n]$ of cardinality at least $3$ has conflict-free chromatic number $\Theta(\sqrt {n})$.</description>

      <title>Shelling of links and star clusters in edgewise subdivision of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some combinatorial properties of the links and the star clusters of the faces in a concrete triangulation $T_{k,q}$ (the edgewise subdivision) of a $(k-1)$-simplex. We show that the link of a vertex in $T_{k,q}$ is the reduced order complexes of the product of chains and determine the number of combinatorially different links of all vertices of $T_{k,q}$. The combinatorial type of the link of an $s$-dimensional face of $T_{k,q}$ corresponds to the partition $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_s)$ of $k$ into $s$ parts and further partitions of each $\lambda_i$. We introduce a new permutation statistic (the faithful initial part) and use it to describe the facets of the star cluster of a facet of $T_{k,q}$. Using a concrete shelling we show that the $i$-th entry of $h$-vector of the star cluster counts the number of permutations from $\mathbb{S}_k$ with exactly $i$ descents, taking into account the faithful initial part as the multiplicity. Finally, we describe a concrete shelling order for $T_{k,q}$, obtain a combinatorial interpretation and find a concrete formula for its $h$-vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple non-complete connected graph on $[n] = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $\kappa(G) \geq 1$ its vertex connectivity. Let $f(G)$ denote the number of free vertices of $G$ and $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ the diameter of $G$. The final goal of this paper is to determine all sequences of integers $(n,f,d,k)$ with $n\geq 8$, $f\geq 0$, $d\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$ for which there exists a finite simple non-complete connected graph on $[n]$ with $f=f(G)$, $d=\mathrm{diam}(G)$ and $k=\kappa(G)$.</description>

      <title>A Refined Laser Method and Faster Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of matrix multiplication is measured in terms of $\omega$, the smallest real number such that two $n\times n$ matrices can be multiplied using $O(n^{\omega+\epsilon})$ field operations for all $\epsilon&gt;0$; the best bound until now is $\omega&lt;2.37287$ [Le Gall'14]. All bounds on $\omega$ since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the `value' of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on $\omega$, and we indeed obtain the best bound on $\omega$ to date: $$\omega &lt; 2.37286.$$ The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12]. Our improvement to the laser method is quite general, and we believe it will have further applications in arithmetic complexity.</description>

      <title>On the interaction of the Coxeter transformation and the rowmotion bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a finite poset and $L$ the associated distributive lattice of order ideals of $P$. Let $\rho$ denote the rowmotion bijection of the order ideals of $P$ viewed as a permutation matrix and $C$ the Coxeter matrix for the incidence algebra $kL$ of $L$. Then we show the identity $(\rho^{-1} C)^2=id$, as was originally conjectured by Sam Hopkins. Recently it was noted that the rowmotion bijection is a special case of the much more general grade bijection $R$ that exists for any Auslander regular algebra. This motivates to study the interaction of the grade bijection and the Coxeter matrix for general Auslander regular algebras. For the class of higher Auslander algebras coming from $n$-representation finite algebras we show that $(R^{-1} C)^2=id$ if $n$ is even and $(R^{-1}C+id)^2=0$ when $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>A Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_2^\omega$-system of order $5$ that is not Abramov of order $5$, and non-measurability of the inverse theorem for the $U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler that every Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: {\mathbf F}_2^n \to {\mathbf C}$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$.</description>

      <title>A hyperelliptic saga on a generating function of the squares of Legendre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We decompose the generating function $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{2n}nP_n(y)^2z^n$ of the squares of Legendre polynomials as a product of periods of hyperelliptic curves. These periods satisfy a family of $\textit{second}$ order differential equations. This is highly unusual since $\textit{four}$ is the expected order for genus 2. These second order equations are arithmetic and yet, surprisingly, their monodromy group is dense in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. This suggests that they cannot be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions, which is novel for arithmetic second order differential equations that are $\textit{defined over}$ $\mathbb{Q}$, and also novel for a $\textit{family}$ of such equations. We complement our analysis with a recipe for constructing similar examples.

      <description>arXiv:2309.01747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z\subset Fl(n)$ be the closure of a generic torus orbit in the full flag variety. Anderson-Tymoczko express the cohomology class of $Z$ as a sum of classes of Richardson varieties. Harada-Horiguchi-Masuda-Park give a decomposition of the permutohedron, the moment map image of $Z$, into subpolytopes corresponding to the summands of the Anderson-Tymoczko formula. We construct an explicit toric degeneration inside $Fl(n)$ of $Z$ into Richardson varieties, whose moment map images coincide with the HHMP decomposition, thereby obtaining a new proof of the Anderson-Tymoczko formula.</description>

      <title>Bangle functions are the generic basis for cluster algebras from punctured surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any possibly-punctured surface with non-empty boundary $\mathbf{\Sigma}=(\Sigma, \mathbb{M}, \mathbb{P})$, and any tagged triangulation $T$ of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in the sense of Fomin--Shapiro--Thurston, the coefficient-free bangle functions of Musiker--Schiffler--Williams coincide with the coefficient-free generic Caldero--Chapoton functions arising from the Jacobian algebra of the quiver with potential $(Q(T), W(T))$ associated to $T$ by Cerulli Irelli and the second author.
  When the set of boundary marked points $\mathbb{M}$ has at least two elements, Schr\"oer and the first two authors have shown, relying heavily on results of Mills, Muller and Qin, that the generic coefficient-free Caldero-Chapoton functions form a basis of the coefficient-free (upper) cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{\Sigma})=\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$. So, the set of bangle functions proposed by Musiker--Schiffler--Williams over ten years ago is indeed a basis.</description>

Abstract: We characterize Borel line graphs in terms of 10 forbidden induced subgraphs, namely the 9 finite graphs from the classical result of Beineke together with a 10th infinite graph associated to the equivalence relation $\mathbb{E}_0$ on the Cantor space. As a corollary, we prove a partial converse to the Feldman--Moore theorem, which allows us to characterize all locally countable Borel line graphs in terms of their Borel chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous multispecies PushTASEP: Dynamics and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a natural multispecies variant of the inhomogeneous PushTASEP with site-dependent rates on the finite ring. We show that the stationary distribution of this process is proportional to the ASEP polynomials at $q = 1$ and $t = 0$. This is done by constructing a multiline process which projects to the multispecies PushTASEP, and identifying its stationary distribution using time-reversal arguments. We also study symmetry properties of the process under interchange of the rates associated to the sites. These results hold not just for events depending on the configuration at a single time in equilibrium, but also for systems out of equilibrium and for events depending on the path of the process over time. Lastly, we give explicit formulas for nearest-neighbour two-point correlations in terms of Schur functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $k\geqslant 3$ and let $A=\{0=a_{0}&lt;a_{1}&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{k-1}\}$ with $\gcd(A)=1$. Freiman-Lev conjecture [V.F. Lev, Restricted set addition in groups, I. The classical setting, J. London Math. Soc. 62(2000), 27-40] is a well-known conjecture which related to restricted sumsets. Up to now, Freiman-Lev conjecture is open for all $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$. In this paper, we prove the Freiman-Lev conjecture is true for $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}&lt;2k-4$. That is, Freiman-Lev conjecture is still open for the case $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}\geq 2k-4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random structures with $n$-element domains over a relational signature, we define its first order (FO) complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space $\ell^{\infty}/c_0$. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to $\{0,1\}$ and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence $\varphi$, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all $\varphi$ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to compare symbolic and ordinary powers of monomial ideals using commutative algebra and combinatorics. Monomial ideals whose symbolic and ordinary powers coincide are called Simis ideals. Weighted monomial ideals are defined by assigning linear weights to monomials. We examine Simis and normally torsion-free ideals, relate some of the properties of monomial ideals and weighted monomial ideals, and present a structure theorem for edge ideals of $d$-uniform clutters whose ideal of covers is Simis in degree $d$. One of our main results is a combinatorial classification of when the dual of the edge ideal of a weighted oriented graph is Simis in degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of integer programming and the $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{VNumber}$.</description>

      <title>The $\text{v}$-function of powers of sums of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, $I\subset R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $J\subset T=K[y_1,\dots,y_m]$ be graded ideals. Set $S=R\otimes_KT$ and let $L=IS+JS$. The behaviour of the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(L^k)$ in terms of the $\text{v}$-functions $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$ is investigated. When $I$ and $J$ are monomial ideals, we describe $\text{v}(L^k)$, giving an explicit formula involving $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Infrared Subtractions &amp; Infrared-Safe Computables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Topographs for binary quadratic forms and class numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a topograph.</description>

      <title>Orbits of permutation groups with no derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. The same conjecture was implicitly made by Feldman. We prove other cases of the conjecture, and we highlight connections our results have with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes. Along the way, we also prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order.</description>
