      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for EDFA: Parameter Identification and Gain Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the key component that facilitates long-haul transmission in optical fiber communications by increasing capacity and reducing costs, accurate characterization and gain settings of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are essential for quality of transmission estimation and system configuration optimization. However, it is difficult to construct accurate and reliable EDFA models due to complex physical mechanisms and dynamic loading conditions. Although some mathematical and data-driven models have been proposed, their practical applications will face limitations of intricate parameter measurements and high data requirements, respectively. To overcome limitations of both methods, a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) method for parameter identification and gain estimation of EDFA is proposed, which greatly reduces the data requirements by embedding physical prior knowledge in the neural network. In this approach, the gain of EDFA can be accurately estimated by a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based forward model when parameters including absorption, gain, saturation, and background loss are known. For practical scenarios where parameters are unknown, PINN-based inverse models are established first to identify actual values of parameters from only several sets of input-output data pairs, and PINN-based forward models are accordingly established for gain estimation with identified values. Moreover, an experimental system is constructed to verify the feasibility and performance of proposed method in practical scenarios. Results show that PIML-based method can effectively identify physical parameters from measured data, and better gain estimation results are achieved with mean absolute error of 0.127 dB and standard deviation of 0.065 dB using identified values than typical values of parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Rhombohedral Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) is an emerging wide-bandgap van der Waals (vdW) material that combines strong second-order nonlinear optical properties with the structural flexibility of layered 2D systems. Here we show that rBN hosts optically-addressable spin defects and single-photon emitters (SPEs). Both are fabricated deterministically, using site-specific techniques, and are compared to their analogues in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Emission spectra in hBN and rBN are compared, and computational models of defects in hBN and rBN are used to elucidate the debated atomic structure of the B-center SPE in BN. Our results establish rBN as a monolithic vdW platform that uniquely combines second-order nonlinear optical properties, optically addressable spin defects, and high-quality SPEs, opening new possibilities for integrated quantum and nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>A deep learning-based noise correction method for light-field fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-field microscopy (LFM) enables rapid volumetric imaging through single-frame acquisition and fast 3D reconstruction algorithms. The high speed and low phototoxicity of LFM make it highly suitable for real-time 3D fluorescence imaging, such as studies of neural activity monitoring and blood flow analysis. However, in vivo fluorescence imaging scenarios, the light intensity needs to be reduced as much as possible to achieve longer-term observations. The resulting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by reduced light intensity significantly degrades the quality of 3D reconstruction in LFM. Existing deep learning-based methods struggle to incorporate the structured intensity distribution and noise characteristics inherent to LFM data, often leading to artifacts and uneven energy distributions. To address these challenges, we propose the denoise-weighted view-channel-depth (DNW-VCD) network, integrating a two-step noise model and energy weight matrix into an LFM reconstruction framework. Additionally, we developed an attenuator-induced imaging system for dual-SNR image acquisition to validate DNW-VCD's performance. Experimental results our method achieves artifact-reduced, real-time 3D imaging with isotropic resolution and lower phototoxicity, as verified through imaging of fluorescent beads, algae, and zebrafish heart.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic-Assisted Growth of Perovskite Microwires for Room-Temperature All-Optical Switching Based on Total Internal Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of efficient integrated photonic circuits is fundamental for ongoing research in information processing and computer science. The greatest challenge in strong light-matter regime facing photonic systems is achieving strong nonlinearities, which are exploitable in strongly coupled systems, leading to the formation of exciton-polaritons. In this context, the use of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites offers a promising alternative, exhibiting robust interactions at Room Temperature (RT). However, the development of perovskite-based integrated devices requires both the ability to achieve long in-plane propagation, and the development of alternative fabrication approaches tailored to perovskite materials, designed to preserve their optical properties and prevent degradation. Herein, we present the realization of a proof-of-concept all-optical switch using propagating polaritons confined in Total Internal Reflection (TIR), which ensures long in-plane propagation and limited optical losses. We realized an efficient injection/extraction of the TIR-confined waveguide polariton modes by employing gold grating couplers prepatterned on the substrate.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution for Interferometric Imaging: Model Comparisons and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Super-Resolution techniques in holographic microscopy to enhance quantitative phase imaging. An off-axis Mach-Zehnder interferometric setup was employed to capture interferograms. The study evaluates two Super-Resolution models, RCAN and Real-ESRGAN, for their effectiveness in reconstructing high-resolution interferograms from a microparticle-based dataset. The models were assessed using two primary approaches: image-based analysis for structural detail enhancement and morphological evaluation for maintaining sample integrity and phase map accuracy. The results demonstrate that RCAN achieves superior numerical precision, making it ideal for applications requiring highly accurate phase map reconstruction, while Real-ESRGAN enhances visual quality and structural coherence, making it suitable for visualization-focused applications. This study highlights the potential of Super-Resolution models in overcoming diffraction-imposed resolution limitations in holographic microscopy, opening the way for improved imaging techniques in biomedical diagnostics, materials science, and other high-precision fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>

      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe subnanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in 1987, including two-cell and multi-speckle DWS, challenges such as merging single and multi-speckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell Echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge Echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of regularized inversion algorithms to enhance data quality at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Photomolecular Effect as A Potential Explanation for The Cloud Absorption Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud absorption is acknowledged as the biggest source of uncertainty in the climate models. For over 70 years, many experiments have reported clouds absorbing more solar radiation than theory could predict. In the visible spectrum, simulations based on optical constants of water lead to negligible cloud absorption. This result had been explored by some experimentalists to calibrate the cloud absorption measurements. However, the author and his collaborators recently discovered that visible light can directly cleave off water molecular clusters at liquid-air interfaces (PNAS, e2312751120, 2023; e2320844121, 2024), which is named the photomolecular effect in analogy to the photoelectric effect. This discovery suggests that a crucial piece of physics has been missing in the existing theories: light can be absorbed at water-air interface. The photomolecular effect can be simulated by generalizing the boundary conditions for the Maxwell equations using Feibelman parameters that were derived in the past research on the surface photoelectric effect and surface plasmons. In this work, the author uses simulation to show that including the photomolecular effect at the air-water interface can potentially explain the cloud absorption anomaly. Although the lack of accurate Feibelman parameter values prevents a direct comparison of the current theory with experiments, this work points to an unexplored mechanism for explaining the cloud absorption anomaly and calls for further investigation on the impacts of photomolecular effect in the climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Emergence of coupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in $m$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is of fundamental importance in a wide range of subjects with generalization to multi-component systems relevant for multi-species fluids and cold atomic mixtures. We present a general framework in which a family of multi-component KdV (mKdV) equations naturally arises from a broader mathematical structure under reasonable assumptions on the nature of the nonlinear couplings. In particular, we derive a universal form for such a system of $m$ KdV equations that is parameterized by $m$ non-zero real numbers and two symmetric functions of those $m$ numbers. Secondly, we show that physically relevant setups such as $N\geq m+1$ multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (MNLS), under scaling and perturbative treatment, reduce to such a mKdV equation for a specific choice of the symmetric functions. The reduction from MNLS to mKdV requires one to be in a suitable parameter regime where the associated sound speeds are repeated. Hence, we connect the assumptions made in the derivation of mKdV system to physically interpretable assumptions for the MNLS equation. Lastly, our approach provides a systematic foundation for facilitating a natural emergence of multi-component partial differential equations starting from a general mathematical structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Flux Grown hBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging material for use in quantum technologies, hosting bright and stable single photon emitters (SPEs). The B-center is one promising SPE in hBN, due to the near-deterministic creation methods and regular emission wavelength. However, incorporation of B-centers in high-quality crystals remains challenging, typically relying on additional post-growth methods to increase creation efficiency. Here, we have demonstrated controlled carbon doping of hBN during growth, using a metal flux based method to increase the efficiency of B-center creation. Importantly, single B-centers with $g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.5$ were able to be generated in the as-grown hBN when carbon additions during growth exceeded 2.5 wt.% C. Resonant excitation measurements revealed linewidths of 3.5 GHz with only moderate spectral diffusion present, demonstrating the applicability of the as-grown hBN as a host for high quality B-centers.</description>

      <title>Scalable registration of single quantum emitters within solid immersion lenses through femtosecond laser writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically active silicon-vacancy (V$_{Si}$) centers in silicon carbide (SiC) serve as qubits, interfacing spins via photons. This capability allows the encoding of photonic information within the spin state and facilitates on-demand readout, promising applications such as quantum memories. However, electron irradiation, a common technique for creating defects in SiC, lacks spatial selectivity, limiting scalability. We employed femtosecond laser writing within photonic structures to generate single (V$_{Si}$) centers, registering them to photonic structures and enhancing optical collection efficiency by a factor of 4.5. Characterization of 28 laser-written defects centers in solid immersion lenses (SILs) showed distributions relative to the photonic structure's center of 260 nm in the x-direction and 60 nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$ nm and $\pm 90$ nm, respectively. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in SiC.</description>

Abstract: In optics and photonics, a small number of building blocks, like resonators, waveguides, arbitrary couplings, and parametric interactions, allow the design of a broad variety of devices and functionalities, distinguished by their scattering properties. These include transducers, amplifiers, and nonreciprocal devices, like isolators or circulators. Usually, the design of such a system is handcrafted by an experienced scientist in a time-consuming process where it remains uncertain whether the simplest possibility has indeed been found. In our work, we develop the discovery algorithm AutoScatter [https://github.com/jlandgr/autoscatter] that automates this challenge. By optimizing the continuous and discrete system properties our automated search identifies the minimal resources required to realize the requested scattering behavior. In the spirit of artificial scientific discovery, it produces a complete list of interpretable solutions and leads to generalizable insights, as we illustrate in several examples. This opens the door towards automated discovery of scattering setups for photonics, microwaves and optomechanics, with possible future extensions to periodic structures, sensing, and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Laser Driven Terahertz Surface Plasmon Polaritons on Long Metal Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a novel scheme for efficiently generating intense terahertz (THz) surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on a sub-wavelength-diameter meter-long metal wire. Driven by a subrelativistic femtosecond laser (a0=0.3, 3 mJ) focused at the wire's midpoint, single-cycle ten-megawatt THz SPPs are excited and propagating bidirectionally along it over 25 cm. The measured laser-to-SPPs energy conversion efficiency is reaching up to ~2.4%, which is the highest value at present. It is proved that the THz SPPs are excited by coherent transition radiation of the subrelativistic laser produced escaping electrons. Particle-in-cell together with CST simulations confirm the experimental observations. Our scheme of using readily available subrelativistic laser should thus be useful to applications requiring terawatt level single-cycle THz SPPs.</description>

      <title>Critical nonreciprocity in gyrotropic coupled-waveguide system for TE-mode optical isolator and circulator</title>

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increasingly require more advanced integrated functionalities and devices to meet the key application challenges. This evolution with the serial integration of optical functions in the same photonic circuit often results in internal reflections and optical feedback, which can specifically destabilize lasers. One solution to overcome this issue is to integrate an optical isolator at the output of the lasers. Among various proposed designs, magneto-optical-based isolators have significantly improved over the past decades in terms of compactness, insertion loss, isolation ratio, and spectral isolation bandwidth. Despite these improvements, the TE optical isolator still lacks in performance. This paper introduces a new operational principle for a TE optical isolator based on modal beating in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) coupled-waveguide system. This approach combines evanescent-coupled silicon waveguides and the magneto-optical effect, resulting in a nonreciprocal propagation that can be optimized for optical isolation. This new concept shows promise in achieving a high-performing TE optical isolator, as it does not depend on resonance and is free from constraints associated with interferometers. Based on data from magneto-optical garnet materials, the simulated device has a length of 500 $\mu$m and its 20 dB-isolation bandwidth is as high as 35 nm. With broadband and high isolation, this simulated device opens possibilities for miniaturizing complex photonic circuits used in optical communication, data communication, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Coherent optical two-photon resonance tomographic imaging in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging is a three-dimensional imaging technique, where a gradient of the magnetic field is used to interrogate spin resonances with spatial resolution. The application of this technique to probe the coherence of atoms with good three-dimensional resolution is a challenging application. We propose and demonstrate an optical method to probe spin resonances via a two-photon Raman transition, reconstructing the 3D-structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence, which is itself subject to external fields. Our method relies on a single time-and-space resolved heterodyne measurement, allowing the reconstruction of a complex 3D coherence profile. Owing to the optical interface, we reach a tomographic image resolution of $14\times14\times36$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^3$. The technique allows to probe any transparent medium with a resonance structure and provides a robust diagnostic tool for atom-based quantum information protocols. As such, it is a viable technique for application to magnetometry, electrometry, and imaging of electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quasi-Global Solutions to Compound Lens Based Computational Imaging Systems</title>

Abstract: Recently, joint design approaches that simultaneously optimize optical systems and downstream algorithms through data-driven learning have demonstrated superior performance over traditional separate design approaches. However, current joint design approaches heavily rely on the manual identification of initial lenses, posing challenges and limitations, particularly for compound lens systems with multiple potential starting points. In this work, we present Quasi-Global Search Optics (QGSO) to automatically design compound lens based computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution in all search results. Extensive experimental results illustrate that QGSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global search ability, which automatically provides compound lens based computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to existing paradigms. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LiGpy/QGSO.</description>

      <title>Transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics in an autonomous discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an autonomous system of two coupled single-mode cavities, one of which interacts with a multimode resonator. We demonstrate that for small coupling strengths between single-mode cavities, the Loschmidt echo oscillates periodically in time and spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry takes place. The Loschmidt echo behavior is an indication of the non-ergodic nature of the system when its evolution is time-reversible and the system retains a memory of the initial state under the action of small perturbations. This behavior reveals the presence of a time crystalline order in the autonomous system. In this regime, the system is a new class of time crystals - autonomous discrete time crystals. An increase in the coupling strength leads to a transition from periodic oscillations to an exponential decay in time of the Loschmidt echo. This corresponds to the transition from non-ergodic behavior to ergodic one in the system, and is accompanied by the disappearance of time crystalline order. We demonstrate that at the transition point the time-averaged variance of the number of photons reaches a maximum, which serves as a signature of the transition. We show that such a transition can also be observed when changing the number of degrees of freedom in the resonator, which is achieved by changing its length.</description>

      <title>In Situ Optimization of an Optoelectronic Reservoir Computer with Digital Delayed Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>
