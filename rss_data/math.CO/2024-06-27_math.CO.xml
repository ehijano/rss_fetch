      <title>Spectral conditions implying the existence of doubly chorded cycles without or with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What spectral conditions imply a graph contains a chorded cycle? This question was asked by R.J. Gould in 2022. We answer three modified versions of Gould's question by giving tight spectral conditions that imply the existence of doubly chorded cycle, a doubly chorded cycle with two chords incident to a vertex, and a doubly chorded cycle on five vertices with two chords incident to one vertex, in a graph, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work of Scott and Wilmer and of Woodroofe extends the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem from set systems to subspaces of k-forms in an exterior algebra. We prove an extension of the Hilton-Milner theorem to the exterior algebra setting, answering in a strong way a question asked by these authors.</description>

      <title>The Repetition Threshold for Rote Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17867v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Rote words, which are infinite binary words with factor complexity $2n$. We prove that the repetition threshold for this class is $5/2$. Our technique is purely computational, using the Walnut theorem prover and a new technique for generating automata from morphisms due to the first author and his co-authors.</description>

      <title>Equidistant dimension of Johnson and Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the recently introduced concept of equidistant dimension $eqdim(G)$ of graph $G$ is considered. Useful property of distance-equalizer set of arbitrary graph $G$ has been established. For Johnson graphs $J_{n,2}$ and Kneser graphs $K_{n,2}$ exact values for $eqdim(J_{n,2})$ and $eqdim(K_{n,2})$ have been derived, while for Johnson graphs $J_{n,3}$ it is proved that $eqdim(J_{n,3}) \le n-2$. Finally, exact value of $eqdim(J_{2k,k})$ for odd $k$ has been presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to study some $n$-tuples of elements belonging to a ring $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ related to the combinatorics of congruence subgroups of the modular group. More precisely, we will focus here on the notion of minimal monomial solutions. These are the solutions of a matrix equation (also appearing during the study of Coxeter's friezes), modulo an integer $N$, all of whose components are identical and minimal for this property. Our objective here is to study the links between the size of minimal monomial solutions and a property of irreducibility which is central in the study of the combinatorics of the modular group. In particular, we will obtain an upper bound of the size of irreducible monomial solutions and we will prove that some sizes automatically lead to irreducibility.</description>

In particular, we determine all mixed graphs without negative $4$-cycle whose spectral radius does not exceed $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}}$, and identify all limit points of spectral radii of mixed graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Extension Techniques for Discovering Non-Algebraic Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit some combinatorial and information-theoretic extension techniques for detecting non-algebraic matroids. These are the Dress-Lov\'asz and Ahlswede-K\"orner extension properties. We provide optimizations of these techniques to reduce their computational complexity, finding new non-algebraic matroids on 9 and 10 points. In addition, we use the Ahlswede-K\"orner extension property to find better lower bounds on the information ratio of secret sharing schemes for ports of non-algebraic matroids.</description>

      <title>Solution of some tiling open problems of Propp, Lai, and some related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <title>Towards odd-sunflowers: temperate families and lightnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by odd-sunflowers, introduced recently by Frankl, Pach, and P{\'a}lv{\"o}lgyi, we initiate the study of temperate families: a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P}([n])$ is said to be \emph{temperate} if each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ contains at most $|A|$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$ as a proper subset.
  We show that the maximum size of a temperate family is attained by the middle two layers of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$. As a more general result, we obtain that the middle $t+1$ layers of the hypercube maximise the size of a family $\mathcal{F}$ such that each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ contains at most $\sum_{j=1}^t \binom{|A|}{j}$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$ as a proper subset. Moreover, we classify all such families consisting of the maximum number of sets.
  In the case of intersecting temperate families, we find the maximum size and classify all intersecting temperate families consisting of the maximum number of sets for odd $n$. We also conjecture the maximum size for even $n$.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in a Hypercube Spatial Voting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conditions for equilibria in the following Voronoi game on the discrete hypercube. Two players position themselves in $\{0,1\}^d$ and each receives payoff equal to the measure (under some probability distribution) of their Voronoi cell (the set of all points which are closer to them than to the other player). This game can be thought of as a discrete analogue of the Hotelling--Downs spatial voting model in which the political spectrum is determined by $d$ binary issues rather than a continuous interval.
  We observe that if an equilibrium does exist then it must involve the two players co-locating at the majority point (ie the point representing majority opinion on each separate issue). Our main result is that a sufficient condition for an equilibrium is that on each issue the majority option is held by at least $\frac{3}{4}$ of voters. The value $\frac{3}{4}$ can be improved slightly in a way that depends on $d$ and with this improvement the result is best possible. We give similar sufficient conditions for the existence of a local equilibrium.
  We also analyse the situation where the distribution is a mix of two product measures. We show that either there is an equilibrium or the best response to the majority point is its antipode.</description>

      <title>Hook length biases for self-conjugate partitions and partitions with distinct odd parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a hook length bias between self-conjugate partitions and partitions of distinct odd parts, demonstrating that there are more hooks of fixed length $t \geq 2$ among self-conjugate partitions of $n$ than among partitions of distinct odd parts of $n$ for sufficiently large $n$. More precisely, we derive asymptotic formulas for the total number of hooks of fixed length $t$ in both classes. This resolves a conjecture of Ballantine, Burson, Craig, Folsom, and Wen.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Graph Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define, study, and construct {\em Error-Correcting Graph Codes}. An error-correcting graph code of distance $\delta$ is a family $C$ of graphs, on a common vertex set of size $n$, such that if we start with any graph in $C$, we would have to modify the neighborhoods of at least $\delta n$ vertices in order to reach some other graph in $C$.
  This is a natural graph generalization of the standard Hamming distance error-correcting codes for binary strings. We show:
  1. Combinatorial results determining the optimal rate vs distance tradeoff nonconstructively.
  2. A connection to rank-metric codes, enabling some simple and some involved constructions achieving certain positive rates and distances.
  3. Graph code analogues of Reed-Solomon codes and code concatenation, leading to positive distance codes for all rates and positive rate codes for all distances.
  4. Graph code analogues of dual-BCH codes, yielding large codes with distance $\delta = 1-o(1)$. This gives an explicit "graph code of Ramsey graphs".
  Several recent works, starting with the paper of Alon, Gujgiczer, K\"orner, Milojevi\'c, and Simonyi, have studied more general graph codes; where the symmetric difference between any two graphs in the code is required to have a desired property. Error-correcting graph codes are a particularly interesting instantiation of this concept.</description>

      <title>On the binomial transforms of Ap\'ery-like sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(2)$, Ap\'ery defined two integer sequences through $3$-term recurrences, which are known as the famous Ap\'ery numbers. Zagier, Almkvist--Zudilin and Cooper successively introduced the other $13$ sporadic sequences through variants of Ap\'ery's $3$-term recurrences. All of the $15$ sporadic sequences are called Ap\'ery-like sequences. Motivated by Gessel's congruences mod $24$ for the Ap\'ery numbers, we investigate the congruences in the form $u_n\equiv \alpha^n \pmod{N_{\alpha}}~(\alpha\in \mathbb{Z},N_{\alpha}\in \mathbb{N}^{+})$ for all of the $15$ Ap\'ery-like sequences $\{u_n\}_{n\ge 0}$. Let $N_{\alpha}$ be the largest positive integer such that $u_n\equiv \alpha^n \pmod{N_{\alpha}}$ for all non-negative integers $n$. We determine the values of $\max\{N_{\alpha}|\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for all of the $15$ Ap\'ery-like sequences $\{u_n\}_{n\ge 0}$.The binomial transforms of Ap\'ery-like sequences provide us a unified approach to this type of congruences for Ap\'ery-like sequences.</description>

      <title>On Toeplitz graphs being line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Toeplitz graph $T_n \langle t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_k\rangle$ is a simple graph with the vertex set $[n]$ such that two vertices $v$ and $w$ are adjacent if and only if $|v-w| = t_i$ for some $i \in [k]$.
  In this paper, we investigate line Toeplitz graphs, which are Toeplitz graphs that happen to be line graphs.
  We first show that for a sufficiently large $n$, the family of claw-free Toeplitz graphs of order $n$ is $T_n \langle t,2t,\ldots,kt\rangle$ for some nonnegative integers $t$ and $k$.
  Interestingly, this family consists of a union of Toeplitz graphs each of which is isomorphic to a $k$-tree the notion of which was introduced by Patil in 1986.
  Then we completely characterize $T_n \langle t,2t,\ldots,kt\rangle$ for any positive integer $n$ that is a line graph.
  Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive description of a line Toeplitz graph $T_n \langle t_1,t_2\rangle$ and $T_n \langle t_1,t_2,t_3\rangle$.
  In general, line Toeplitz graph seems very challenging to characterize completely. Even for $T_n \langle t_1,t_2,t_3\rangle$, it was not easy to do so.
  It is also worth mentioning that there is a line Toeplitz graph that is not in the form $T_n \langle t,2t,3t\rangle$.</description>

      <title>On Frobenius Formulas of Power Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A=(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ be a sequence of relative prime integers, each greater than or equal to 2. The Frobenius number $g(A)$ represents the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a nonnegative linear combination of the elements in $A$. Our recent work has introduced a combinatorial method for calculating $g(A)$ in the specific form $A=(a, a+B)=(a, a+b_1, \ldots, a+b_k)$. This method reduces the problem to a simpler optimization problem, denoted as $O_B(M)$. In this paper, we apply this method to solve the open problem of characterizing $g(A)$ for the square sequence $A=(a,a+1,a+2^2,\ldots, a+k^2)$. We demonstrate that the Frobenius number $g(a, a+1^2, a+2^2, \ldots)$ for the infinite square sequence admits a simpler solution. This is because the corresponding optimization problem, $O_B(M)$, can be solved by applying number-theoretic principles, specifically Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem and related results. Consequently, we are able to resolve the open problem by utilizing Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem in conjunction with generating functions.</description>

      <title>The Frobenius transform of a symmetric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an abelian group homomorphism $\mathscr{F}$, which we call the Frobenius transform, from the ring of symmetric functions to the ring of the symmetric power series. The matrix entries of $\mathscr{F}$ in the Schur basis are the restriction coefficients $r_\lambda^\mu = \dim \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{S}_n}(V_\mu, \mathbb{S}^\lambda \mathbb{C}^n)$, which are known to be nonnegative integers but have no known combinatorial interpretation. The Frobenius transform satisfies the identity $\mathscr{F}\{fg\} = \mathscr{F}\{f\} \ast \mathscr{F}\{g\}$, where $\ast$ is the Kronecker product.
  We prove for all symmetric functions $f$ that $\mathscr{F}\{f\} = \mathscr{F}_{\mathrm{Sur}}\{f\} \cdot (1 + h_1 + h_2 + \cdots)$, where $\mathscr{F}_{\mathrm{Sur}}\{f\}$ is a symmetric function with the same degree and leading term as $f$. Then, we compute the matrix entries of $\mathscr{F}_{\mathrm{Sur}}\{f\}$ in the complete homogeneous, elementary, and power sum bases and of $\mathscr{F}^{-1}_{\mathrm{Sur}}\{f\}$ in the complete homogeneous and elementary bases, giving combinatorial interpretations of the coefficients where possible. In particular, the matrix entries of $\mathscr{F}^{-1}_{\mathrm{Sur}}\{f\}$ in the elementary basis count words with a constraint on their Lyndon factorization.
  As an example application of our main results, we prove that $r_\lambda^\mu = 0$ if $|\lambda \cap \hat\mu| &lt; 2|\hat\mu| - |\lambda|$, where $\hat\mu$ is the partition formed by removing the first part of $\mu$. We also prove that $r_\lambda^\mu = 0$ if the Young diagram of $\mu$ contains a square of side length greater than $2^{\lambda_1 - 1}$, and this inequality is tight.</description>

      <title>Convex Geometry of Building Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building sets were introduced in the study of wonderful compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements and were later generalized to finite meet-semilattices. Convex geometries, the duals of antimatroids, offer a robust combinatorial abstraction of convexity. Supersolvable convex geometries and antimatroids appear in the study of poset closure operators, Coxeter groups, and matroid activities. We prove that the building sets on a finite meet-semilattice form a supersolvable convex geometry. As an application, we demonstrate that building sets and nested set complexes respect certain restrictions of finite meet-semilattices unifying and extending results of several authors.</description>

      <title>Weak colourings of Kirkman triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\delta$-colouring of the point set of a block design is said to be {\em weak} if no block is monochromatic. The {\em weak chromatic number} $\chi(S)$ of a block design $S$ is the smallest integer $\delta$ such that $S$ has a weak $\delta$-colouring. It has previously been shown that any Steiner triple system has weak chromatic number at least $3$ and that for each $v\equiv 1$ or $3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Steiner triple system on $v$ points that has weak chromatic number $3$. Moreover, for each integer $\delta \geq 3$ there exist infinitely many Steiner triple systems with weak chromatic number $\delta$.
  We consider colourings of the subclass of Steiner triple systems which are resolvable. We show that for each $v\equiv 3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Kirkman triple system on $v$ points with weak chromatic number $3$. We also show that for each integer $\delta \geq 3$, there exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with weak chromatic number $\delta$. We close with several open problems.</description>

      <title>Caps and Wickets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H_n^{(3)}$ be a 3-uniform linear hypergraph, i.e. any two edges have at most one vertex common. A special hypergraph, {\em wicket}, is formed by three rows and two columns of a $3 \times 3$ point matrix. In this note, we give a new lower bound on the Tur\'an number of wickets using estimates on cap sets. We also show that this problem is closely connected to important questions in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Winning Maker Strategy in the Maker-Breaker $C_4$-Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maker-Breaker subgraph games are among the most famous combinatorial games. For given $n,q \in \mathbb{N}$ and a subgraph $C$ of the complete graph $K_n$, the two players, called Maker and Breaker, alternately claim edges of $K_n$. In each round of the game Maker claims one edge and Breaker is allowed to claim up to $q$ edges. If Maker is able to claim all edges of a copy of $C$, he wins the game. Otherwise Breaker wins. In this work we introduce the first constructive strategy for Maker for the $C_4$-Maker-Breaker game and show that he can win the game if $q &lt; 0.16 n^{2/3}$. According to the theorem of Bednarska and Luczak (2000) $n^{2/3}$ is asymptotically optimal for this game, but the constant given there for a random Maker strategy is magnitudes apart from our constant 0.16.</description>

      <title>On the independence number of sparser random Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_A$ of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined to have vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and an edge between two distinct vertices $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in A$. Green and Morris proved that if the set $A$ is a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $p = 1/2$, then the independence number of $\Gamma_A$ is asymptotically equal to $\alpha(G(n, 1/2))$ with high probability. Our main theorem is the first extension of their result to $p = o(1)$: we show that, with high probability, $$\alpha(\Gamma_A) = (1 + o(1)) \alpha(G(n, p))$$ as long as $p \ge (\log n)^{-1/80}$.
  One of the tools in our proof is a geometric-flavoured theorem that generalises Fre\u{i}man's lemma, the classical lower bound on the size of high dimensional sumsets. We also give a short proof of this result up to a constant factor; this version yields a much simpler proof of our main theorem at the expense of a worse constant.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction in one dimension from unlabeled Euclidean lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.06550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $3$-connected ordered graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Let $\mathbf{p}$ be a randomly chosen mapping of these $n$ vertices to the integer range $\{1, 2,3, \ldots, 2^b\}$ for $b\ge m^2$. Let $\ell$ be the vector of $m$ Euclidean lengths of $G$'s edges under $\mathbf{p}$. In this paper, we show that, with high probability over $\mathbf{p}$, we can efficiently reconstruct both $G$ and $\mathbf{p}$ from $\ell$. This reconstruction problem is NP-HARD in the worst case, even if both $G$ and $\ell$ are given. We also show that our results stand in the presence of small amounts of error in $\ell$, and in the real setting, with sufficiently accurate length measurements.
  Our method combines lattice reduction, which has previously been used to solve random subset sum problems, with an algorithm of Seymour that can efficiently reconstruct an ordered graph given an independence oracle for its matroid.</description>

      <title>Content systems and deformations of cyclotomic KLR algebras of type $A$ and $C$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study of the cyclotomic KLR algebras of affine types $A$ and $C$. We start by introducing a graded deformation of these algebras and the constructing all of the irreducible representations of the deformed cyclotomic KLR algebras using content systems and a generalisation of the Young's seminormal forms for the symmetric groups. Quite amazingly, this theory simultaneously captures the representation theory of the cyclotomic KLR algebras of types $A$ and $C$, with the main difference being the definition of residue sequences of tableaux. We then use our semisimple deformations to construct two "dual" cellular bases for the non-semisimple KLR algebras of affine types $A$ and $C$. As applications of this theory we recover many of the main features from the representation theory in type $A$, simultaneously proving them for the cyclotomic KLR algebras of types $A$ and $C$. These results are completely new in type $C$ and we, usually, more direct proofs in type $A$. In particular, we show that these algebras categorify the irreducible integrable highest weight modules of the corresponding Kac-Moody algebras, we construct and classify their simple modules, we investigate links with canonical bases and we generalise Kleshchev's modular branching rules to these algebras.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we introduce simple structures for the analysis of complex hypergraphs, hypergraph animals. These structures are designed to describe the local node neighbourhoods of nodes in hypergraphs. We establish their relationships to lattice animals and network motifs, and we develop their combinatorial properties for sparse and uncorrelated hypergraphs. We make use of the tight link of hypergraph animals to partition numbers, which opens up a vast mathematical framework for the analysis of hypergraph animals. We then study their abundances in random hypergraphs. Two transferable insights result from this analysis: (i) it establishes the importance of high-cardinality edges in ensembles of random hypergraphs that are inspired by the classical Erd\"os-Reny\'i random graphs; and (ii) there is a close connection between degree and hyperedge cardinality in random hypergraphs that shapes animal abundances and spectra profoundly. Both findings imply that hypergraph animals can have the potential to affect information flow and processing in complex systems. Our analysis of also suggests that we need to spend more effort on investigating and developing suitable conditional ensembles of random hypergraphs that can capture real-world structures and their complex dependency structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist convex bodies of constant width in $\mathbb{E}^n$ with illumination number at least $(\cos(\pi/14)+o(1))^{-n}$, answering a question by G. Kalai. Furthermore, we prove the existence of finite sets of diameter $1$ in $\mathbb{E}^n$ which cannot be covered by $(2/\sqrt{3}+o(1))^{n}$ balls of diameter $1$, improving a result by J. Bourgain and J. Lindenstrauss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize Borel line graphs in terms of 10 forbidden induced subgraphs, namely the 9 finite graphs from the classical result of Beineke together with a 10th infinite graph associated to the equivalence relation $\mathbb{E}_0$ on the Cantor space. As a corollary, we prove a partial converse to the Feldman--Moore theorem, which allows us to characterize all locally countable Borel line graphs in terms of their Borel chromatic numbers.</description>
