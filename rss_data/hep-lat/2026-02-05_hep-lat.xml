      <title>Probing Instanton Dynamics in the Pion Vector Form Factor with Wilson Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instanton liquid model is believed to capture the main features of vacuum QCD dynamics. Recently, multiple predictions for hadron structure functions have been derived and compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD calculations, finding a general agreement. In order to explore the precision of the instanton liquid model, one has to compare its predictions with non-perturbative simulations in a regime dominated by instanton dynamics. This has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and the strong running coupling constant. In this contribution, we propose to study a fermionic observable, the pion electromagnetic form factor, for which instanton liquid model predictions have been discussed in Phys.Rev.D 109, 074029. We use the Wilson flow to single out the dominant contribution from the instantons out of a lattice QCD configuration ensemble. We describe the details of our numerical setup, and some first, preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting the coherent state variational algorithm for large $N$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feasibility of studying, numerically, properties of infinite volume QCD-like theories in the large $N$ limit using coherent state variational methods is reassessed. An entirely new implementation of this approach is described, applicable to SU($N$) lattice gauge theories, with or without fundamental representation fermions, on cubic lattices of up to four dimensions. In addition to various test cases, initial results are presented for Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory on an infinite two-dimensional spatial lattice.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): insertions of dimension-six operators that conserve baryon number. In line with our previous publications, we obtain the results in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations. We compute the renormalization of the dimension-six four-fermion and three-gluon operators, as well as the power corrections to lower-dimension operators in the presence of masses, i.e., the down-mixing into dimension-five dipole operators, masses, gauge couplings, and theta terms. Our results are of interest for a broad range of low-energy precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and the QCD Axion: Lecture Notes via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a self-contained, graduate-level introduction to the strong $CP$ problem and QCD axion physics from an effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint. We review the construction of the chiral EFT of QCD yielding a $\theta$-dependent potential, from which vacuum alignment, $\theta$ periodicity and branch structure follow. We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $\theta$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $\theta$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections.</description>
