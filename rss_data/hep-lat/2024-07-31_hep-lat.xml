      <title>Timelike meson form-factors beyond the elastic region from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the vector-isovector timelike form-factors of the pion and the kaon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. We calculate two-point correlation functions with $m_\pi \sim 280$ MeV, extracting both the finite-volume spectrum and matrix elements for these states created from the vacuum by a vector current. After determining the coupled-channel $\pi\pi, K\overline{K}$ scattering amplitudes, we perform the necessary correction for the significant finite-volume effects present in the current matrix elements, leading to the timelike form-factors. We find these to be dominated by the presence of the $\rho$ resonance, and we extract its decay constant by an analytic continuation of the amplitudes to the resonance pole. In addition, the spacelike pion form-factor is determined on the same lattice configurations, and a dispersive parameterization is used to simultaneously describe the spacelike and elastic timelike regions.</description>

      <title>Sparsity dependence of Krylov state complexity in the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 26$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$. Our results also indicate that the Krylov complexity peak has a holographic interpretation similar to the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and effective dimensional reduction in the four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of effective dimensional reduction in the 4D Yang-Mills (YM) theory. We propose a new gauge fixing of "dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate effective dimensional reduction in the DR gauge using SU(3) quenched lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider "$tz$-projection" of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, the 4D YM theory is reduced into an ensemble of 2D YM systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <title>Inclusive reactions from finite Minkowski spacetime correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining in the range of volumes that we studied. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work Phys.Rev.D 109(2024),073007, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable Mathematica notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <title>Study on the electromagnetic properties of the $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ states with $J^P = 1^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is conducted to elucidate their nature, which continues to be the subject of controversy and incomplete understanding in the field. In this study, the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments of the tetraquarks $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ are extracted in the context of a compact diquark-antidiquark configuration with the help of the QCD light-cone rules method. The magnetic dipole moments are given as $\mu_{[sc] [\bar u \bar b]} = -2.12^{+0.74}_{-0.59} \mu_N$, $\mu_{[sc] [\bar d \bar b]} = 1.66^{+0.60}_{-0.46} \mu_N$, and $\mu_{[sc] [\bar s \bar b]} = 2.01^{+0.61}_{-0.50} \mu_N$. The order of magnitude of the magnetic dipole moments would suggest that these outcomes may be achievable in forthcoming experiments. The magnetic and quadrupole moments of hadrons represent another important observable, along with their mass and decay width, which contribute to our understanding of the underlying quark structure and dynamics. Therefore, we hope that the results of this study will prove useful in theoretical and experimental investigations, which we anticipate will be an interesting research topic.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay in a finite volume from relativistic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay process $nn\rightarrow ppee$ within the light Majorana-exchange scenario is studied using the relativistic pionless effective field theory (EFT) in finite-volume cubic boxes with the periodic boundary conditions. Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables from lattice QCD available at $m_\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted with a precision of 10\%-20\% and their volume dependence is investigated. This is possible thanks to the fact that the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be properly renormalized in the relativistic pionless EFT without the uncertain $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ contact term, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case. The predictions for the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly matched to the LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses. Therefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the benchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the predictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>
