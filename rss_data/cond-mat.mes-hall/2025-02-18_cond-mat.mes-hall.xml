      <title>Thermal and thermoelectric transport in flat bands with non-trivial quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although quasiparticles in flat bands have zero group velocity, they can display an anomalous velocity due to the quantum geometry. We address the thermal and thermoelectric transport in flat bands in the clean limit with a small amount of broadening due to inelastic scattering. We derive general Kubo formulas for flat bands in the DC limit up to linear order in the broadening and extract expressions for the thermal conductivity, the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients. We show that the Seebeck coefficient for flat Chern bands is topological up to second order corrections in the broadening. We identify thermal and thermoelectric transport signatures for two generic flat Chern bands and also for the generalized flattened Lieb model, which describes a family of three equally spaced flat Chern bands where the middle one is topologically trivial. Finally, we address the saturation of the quantum metric lower bound for a general family of Hamiltonians with an arbitrary number of flat Chern bands corresponding to SU(2) coherent states. We find that only the extremal bands in this class of Hamiltonians saturate the bound, provided that the momentum dependence of their Hamiltonians is described by a meromorphic function.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability of Skyrmion Tubes in Nanostructured Cuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in bulk materials are typically regarded as two-dimensional structures. However, they also exhibit three-dimensional configurations, known as skyrmion tubes, which elongate and extend in-depth. Understanding the configurations and stabilization mechanism of skyrmion tubes is crucial for the development of advanced spintronic devices. However, the generation and annihilation of skyrmion tubes in confined geometries are still rarely reported. Here, we present direct imaging of skyrmion tubes in nanostructured cuboids of a chiral magnet FeGe using Lorentz transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), while applying an in-plane magnetic field. It is observed that skyrmion tubes stabilize in a narrow field-temperature region near the Curie temperature (Tc). Through a field cooling process, metastable skyrmion tubes can exist in a larger region of the field-temperature diagram. Combining these experimental findings with micromagnetic simulations, we attribute these phenomena to energy differences and thermal fluctuations. Our results could promote topological spintronic devices based on skyrmion tubes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Drude model: surface and non-local effects in near-field radiative heat transfer and the Casimir puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charge and current response functions $P$ and $\Pi$ in a semi-infinite metal block using the electron surface Green's functions. The surface electrons behave similarly to a two-dimensional Fermi gas but are strongly damped due to coupling to the bulk. This substantially reduces the region of validity of the Drude model for $P$, which requires the frequency $\omega \gg \max( v_F q, 1/\tau)$, here $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, $q$ is the wavevector and $\tau$ is an effective relaxation time. As a consequence, for typical metal in near-field heat transfer, the Coulomb interaction goes as $1/d^4$ with the distance of the vacuum gap instead of the well-known $1/d^2$ of Drude model result. The current response $\Pi$ is shown to be highly anisotropic. The Drude model describes well the transverse directions parallel to the surface but is very different in the normal direction up to about 100 lattice sites away from the surface. These ideas and the residue diamagnetic effect of a nonzero $\Pi$ on the surface at zero frequency still cannot resolve the Casimir puzzle.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally High Nonlinear Optical Response in Two-dimensional Type II Dirac Semimetal Nickel di-Telluride (NiTe2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel ditelluride (NiTe2) is a newly identified Type-II Dirac semimetal, showing novel characteristics in electronic transport and optical experiments. In this study, we explored the nonlinear optical properties of two-dimensional NiTe2 using experimental and computational techniques (density functional theory-based approach). Few layered two-dimensional NiTe2 (2D-NiTe2) are synthesized using liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), which is characterized using X-ray diffraction technique, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy. The nonlinear refractive index and third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the prepared 2D-NiTe2 are determined from the self-induced diffraction pattern generated using different wavelengths ( 405, 532, and 650 nm) in the far field. In addition, the diffraction pattern generated by spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) is further verified by varying concentration (2D-NiTe2 in the IPA solvent), wavelength (of incoming laser beams), and cuvette width (active path length). The high value of third-order nonlinear susceptibility (in order of 10-9 e.s.u.) determined using SSPM in the 2D-NiTe2 can be attributed to the laser-induced hole coherence effect. Lastly, utilizing the reverse saturable absorption property of 2D-hBN, asymmetric light propagation is also demonstrated in the 2D-NiTe2/2D-hBN heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent spin susceptibility and effective mass in monolayer MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin MoSe2 is a promising platform for investigating quantum phenomena due to its large effective mass, high crystal quality, and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we demonstrate a triple-gate device design with bismuth contacts, enabling reliable ohmic contact down to low electron densities, with a maximum Hall mobility of approximately 22,000 cm2/Vs. Low-temperature transport measurements illustrate metal-insulator transitions, and density-dependent quantum oscillation sequences. Enhanced spin susceptibility and density-dependent effective mass are observed, attributed to interaction effects and valley polarization. These findings establish monolayer MoSe2 as a versatile platform for further exploring interaction-driven quantum states.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons and domain walls in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Electrical Detection of Reciprocal Orbital Edelstein Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-Orbitronics leverages the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in solids for information processing. The orbital Edelstein effect and orbital Hall effect, where the charge current induces a nonequilibrium orbital angular momentum, offer a promising method to manipulate nanomagnets efficiently using light elements. Despite extensive research, understanding the Onsager reciprocity of orbital transport, fundamentally rooted in the second law of thermodynamics and time-reversal symmetry, remains elusive. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the Onsager reciprocity of orbital transport in an orbital Edelstein system by utilizing nonlocal measurements. This method enables the precise identification of the chemical potential generated by orbital accumulation, avoiding the limitations associated with local measurements. Remarkably, we observe that the direct and inverse orbital-charge conversion processes produce identical electric voltages, confirming Onsager reciprocity in orbital transport. Additionally, we find that the orbital decay length, approximately 100 nm at room temperature, is independent of Cu thickness and decreases with lowering temperature, revealing a distinct contrast to spin transport behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into both the reciprocity of the charge-orbital interconversion and the nonlocal correlation of orbital degree of freedom, laying the ground for orbitronics devices with long-range interconnections.</description>

      <title>Imaging current flow and injection in scalable graphene devices through NV-magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global electronic properties of solid-state devices are strongly affected by the microscopic spatial paths of charge carriers. Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Storing quantum coherence in a quantum dot nuclear spin ensemble for over 100 milliseconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: States with long coherence are a crucial requirement for qubits and quantum memories. Nuclear spins in epitaxial quantum dots are a great candidate, offering excellent isolation from external environments and on-demand coupling to optical flying qubits. However, coherence times are limited to $\lesssim1$ ms by the dipole-dipole interactions between the nuclei and their quadrupolar coupling to inhomogeneous crystal strain. Here, we combine strain engineering of the nuclear spin ensemble and tailored dynamical decoupling sequences to achieve nuclear spin coherence times exceeding 100 ms. Recently, a reversible transfer of quantum information into nuclear spin ensembles has been demonstrated in quantum dots. Our results provide a path to develop this concept into a functioning solid-state quantum memory suitable for quantum repeaters in optical quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in nonmagnetic/noncollinear-antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) appearing at the interface of a nonmagnetic/noncollinear-antiferromagnetic bilayer. DMI is an antisymmetric exchange interaction between neighboring magnetic spins, arising in the absence of inversion center between the spins and the explicit expression of which being dictated by system symmetry. We formulate the interfacial DMI for different crystalline orientations of the noncollinear antiferromagnet with stacked-Kagome lattice structure. From this formulation, we show that, when the Kagome planes are perpendicular to the sample film plane, the DMI serves as a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. Our findings reveal a novel physical manifestation of a DMI, shedding a new light on microscopic mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy in noncollinear antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Strain engineering of valley-polarized hybrid excitons in a 2D semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding and manipulating digital information in quantum degrees of freedom is one of the major challenges of today's science and technology. The valley indices of excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are well-suited to address this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new class of strain-tunable, valley-polarized hybrid excitons in monolayer TMDs, comprising a pair of energy-resonant intra- and intervalley excitons. These states combine the advantages of bright intravalley excitons, where the valley index directly couples to light polarization, and dark intervalley excitons, characterized by low depolarization rates. We demonstrate that the hybridized state of dark KK' intervalley and defect-localized excitons exhibits a degree of circular polarization of emitted photons that is three times higher than that of the constituent species. Moreover, a bright KK intravalley and a dark KQ exciton form a coherently coupled hybrid state under energetic resonance, with their valley depolarization dynamics slowed down a hundredfold. Overall, these valley-polarized hybrid excitons with strain-tunable valley character emerge as prime candidates for valleytronic applications in future quantum and information technology.</description>

      <title>Tracking Adiabaticity in Non-Equilibrium Many-Body Systems: The Hard Case of the X-ray Photoemission in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level of adiabaticity determines many properties of time-dependent quantum systems. However, a reliable and easy-to-apply criterion to check and track it remains an open question, especially for complex many-body systems. Here we test techniques based on metrics which have been recently proposed to quantitatively characterize and track adiabaticity. We investigate the time evolution of x-ray photoemission in metals, which displays a strongly out-of-equilibrium character, continuum energy spectrum, and experiences the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe: a nightmarish scenario for this type of test. Our results show that the metrics-based methods remains valid. In particular, we demonstrate that the natural local density distance is able not only to track adiabaticity, but also to provide information not captured by the corresponding Bures' or trace distances about the system's dynamics. In the process, we establish an explicit upper limit for this local density distance in terms of the trace distance, and derive a simple analytical solution that accurately describes the time evolution of a Fermi gas with a localized scattering potential for a large range of parameters. We also demonstrate that, for x-ray photoemission, the quantum adiabatic criterion, as commonly used, fails to predict and track adiabaticity. The local particle density is typically much simpler to compute than the corresponding quantum state and it is experimentally measurable: this makes the method tested extremely appealing.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent approach to the X-ray photoemission problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray photoemission from simple metals has been thoroughly studied, experimentally, and theoretically, in the frequency domain. Here we investigate the same problem in the time domain, with the ultimate purpose of improving the numerical renormalization-group method. We focus our study on the time dependence of the photoemission current $\mathcal{F}(t)$, a fidelity, in the terminology of quantum information. To establish benchmarks, we first calculate $\mathcal{F}(t)$ analytically and numerically for a tight-binding model. Analytically, we derive an approximate expression that becomes very precise at large times. Numerically, we diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian and compute $\mathcal{F}(t)$ from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a straightforward procedure that covers the segment of the $t$ axis in which the analytical expression is less accurate. The time dependence shows features of physical interest that have received little attention because they are inconspicuous in the frequency domain; the analytical expression provides a simple interpretation and traces them to an unusual form of interference. We then turn to eNRG, a recently proposed real-space variant that is more flexible than Wilson's NRG method, and present two complementary time-dependent algorithms. Comparison with the benchmarks shows that one of the eNRG algorithms yields virtually exact photocurrents with a small fraction of the computational effort to diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian. The second algorithm is computationally less demanding and produces precise results at long times. In contemplation of extensions to correlated-impurity models, we identify sources of deviation and discuss the virtues and drawbacks of the two procedures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gilbert Damping via Cubic Spin-Orbit Coupling at 2DHG/Ferromagnetic Insulator Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of Gilbert damping at 2DHG/ferromagnetic insulator (FI) interfaces, where spin pumping from the FI layer injects spins into the 2DHG, and cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) significantly boosts spin relaxation and spin-pumping efficiency compared to 2DEG systems. The dominant contribution to spin damping arises from interband transitions which does exhibits conductivity-like behavior as the temperature, \( T \to 0 \). Our results reveal that damping remains stronger than in 2DEG due to the persistent influence of cubic RSOC. The interplay between RSOC and magnon absorption broadens the spectral response, with the damping peak shifting more notably at higher temperatures. Stronger RSOC expands the magnon interaction phase space, thus widening the damping spectrum. A key observation emerges with the Fermi level (\(E_f\)): a finite \(E_f\) sustains spin imbalance and enhances damping, whereas \(E_f = 0\) suppresses it, unlike in 2DEG. The electric field tunability of RSOC enables real-time control over spin relaxation and angular momentum transfer, offering a pathway toward voltage-controlled spintronic devices. These findings highlight the superior potential of 2DHG for tailoring spin dynamics via electric and thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Layer-Resolved Quantum Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Counterflow and Machine Learning Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</description>

      <title>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases arise as the parameters of a quantum system are varied as a function of time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependency can be removed and the Berry topological phase can be obtained from a trajectory on the parameter space. Although this approach is usually applied in solid-state physics without further reflection, in many cases, say in Dirac or Weyl materials, the adiabatic approximation is never met as many systems are gapless. Here it is shown how to use other time dependent defined topological quantities, in particular the Aharonov-Anandan phase that provides information not only about the topology but also about band transitions. Therefore, we analyze the problem of graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, demonstrating how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary information about the topology and interband transitions. This is achieved using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetization symmetry for the MnTe altermagnetic candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves nearly independent of temperature, they mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes below the N\'eel vector reorientation field. In contrast, $M(\alpha)$ dependences are quite unusual at low temperatures and in low magnetic fields: below 81~K, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump, the easy axis direction is equally $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. We provide experimental arguments that the spontaneous magnetization of MnTe below 81~K differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism of conventional antiferromagnetics, thus, it requires to take into account formation of the altermagnetic ground state. Despite the MnTe altermagnetic state is expected to be g-wave, i.e. $\pi/3$ periodic one, our experiment confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Single-Molecule Water Motion on h-BN and Graphene: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Behaviour of Water on 2D Material Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding water behaviour on 2D materials is crucial for sensing, microfluidics, and tribology. While water/graphene interactions are well studied, water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) remains largely unexplored. Despite structural similarity to graphene, h-BN's slightly polar B-N bonds impart a large band gap, high thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, making it promising for electronics, lubricants, and coatings. Moreover, existing water studies often focus on multilayer water dynamics, overlooking single-molecular details. We bridge this gap by studying single-molecular water friction and diffusion on h-BN, comparing it with graphene using helium spin-echo experiments and ab initio calculations. Our findings show that water diffusion on h-BN/Ni follows a complex rotational-translational dynamic, unlike graphene. While conventional views treat water motion as discrete jumps between equivalent adsorption sites, we demonstrate that on h-BN, water molecules rotate freely around their centre of mass. Although the binding energies of water on h-BN and graphene are similar, the activation energy for water dynamics on h-BN is 2.5 times lower than on graphene, implying a much lower barrier for molecular mobility. The fundamentally different diffusion characteristics which classical models cannot capture, underscores the need to rethink how we model water on polar 2D materials. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the metal substrate strongly influences water friction, with h-BN/Ni showing a markedly lower friction than graphene/Ni, in stark contrast to the free-standing materials. These findings challenge assumptions about 2D material-water interactions, highlighting the crucial role of substrate effects in chemistry and material science and offer insights for designing next-generation microfluidic devices that require precise water mobility control.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Entanglement Transitions from Non-Hermitian Skin Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled unconventional spectral, topological and critical phenomena, challenging traditional band theories. This thesis advances its understanding in three aspects. First, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is shown to protect real spectra in some ansatz models, not relying on crystal symmetries. Second, we discover the phenomenon of scaling-induced non-Hermitian exceptional criticality (SIEC), marked by a unconventional negative dip in entanglement entropy scaling, deviating from the well-established logarithmic behavior. A scaling-dependent generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) is developed to analytically predict this SIEC. Third, we formulate a theoretical framework for phase-space GBZs, extending the concept of the GBZ to position-dependent systems, particularly for those with spatially inhomogeneous NHSE hoppings. Unprecedented phenomena, including GBZ bifurcation which also protects the stability of real spectra, are revealed, introducing new forms of topological robustness governed by phase-space GBZ bifurcations. This thesis also explores the NHSE in Bethe lattices, where the hyperbolic-like lattice geometry gives rise to a hierarchy of loop sizes that leads to new forms of critical NHSE behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Spin frustration and unconventional spin twisting state in van der Waals ferromagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically flat surfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials pave an avenue for addressing a long-standing fundamental issue of how a perfectly compensated antiferromagnet (AFM) surface frustrates a ferromagnetic (FM) overlayer in FM/AFM heterostructures. By revealing the AFM and FM spin structures separately in vdW Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 heterostructures, we find that C-type in-plane AFM NiPS3 develops three equivalent AFM domains which are robust against external magnetic field and magnetic coupling with Fe5GeTe2. Consequently, spin frustration at the Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 interface was shown to develop a perpendicular Fe5GeTe2 magnetization in the interfacial region that switches separately from the bulk of the Fe5GeTe2 magnetizations. In particular, we discover an unconventional spin twisting state that the Fe5GeTe2 spins twist from perpendicular direction near the interface to in-plane direction away from the interface in Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3. Our finding of the twisting spin texture is a unique property of spin frustration in van der Waals magnetic heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission medium to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Dimension Effect of Nanocarbon Precursors on Diamond Synthesis and Transformation Mechanism under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensions is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, we report the imperative dimension effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure, by comparing the distinct transition processes of zero-dimensional (0D) carbon nanocages (CNCs) and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrated that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure-temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimension effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced liquid-solid phase coexistence in 2D electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent imaging experiments show a surprisingly robust regime of liquid-solid phase coexistence in a 2D electron system near the quantum melting/freezing transition, with the two phases mixed in mesoscopic domains. Strikingly, the experiments find no noticeable difference in electron density between the liquid and solid domains, which is at odds with both microemulsion scenarios and scenarios in which phase coexistence is driven by fluctuations of a long-ranged disorder potential. Here, we show that such phase coexistence without density difference can be induced by random fluctuations of a short-ranged disorder potential. We further show that disorder tends to stabilize the Wigner Crystal phase to higher densities, which is also consistent with the experiments.</description>

      <title>An ultra-compact deterministic source of maximally entangled photon pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ultra-compact source of maximally entangled on-demand photon pairs. Our results are based on coupling of single GaAs quantum dots that are embedded in monolithic micro-lenses to a single-mode fiber with directly attached to 3D-printed micro-optics (NA of 0.6) inside a cryogenic environment. This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation. Utilizing the exciton-biexciton emission cascade available in GaAs quantum dots under resonant excitation, near maximally entangled photon pairs with peak entanglement negatives 2n of 0.96(2) in a 4 ps time window, and 0.81(1) when averaged over one exciton lifetime, are demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the desorption mechanism of hydrogen isotopes from graphene surface using first-principles calculations, with focus on the effects of quantum tunneling. At low temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a dominant role in the desorption process of both hydrogen monomers and dimers. In the case of dimer desorption, two types of mechanisms, namely the traditional one-step desorption in the form of molecules (molecular mechanism), and the two-step desorption in the form of individual atoms (atomic mechanism) are studied and compared. For the ortho-dimers, the dominant desorption mechanism is found to switch from the molecular mechanism to the atomic mechanism above a critical temperature, which is respectively ~ 300 K and 200 K for H and D.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of machine learning techniques for conditional generative adversarial networks in inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Review on thermoelectric properties of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.</description>

      <title>Irreversible multi-band effects and Lifshitz transitions at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface under field effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the irreversible effects of an applied electric field on the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 conducting interfaces, with focus on their multiband character. We study samples of different types, namely with either crystalline or amorphous LaAlO3 overlayer. Our two-band analysis highlights the similarity of the electronic properties of crystalline and amorphous interfaces, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities. Furthermore, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns, at least in qualitative terms, in the two types of samples. In agreement with previous works on crystalline interfaces, we observe that an irreversible charge depletion takes place after application of a first positive back gate voltage step. Such charge depletion affects much more, in relative terms, the higher and three-dimensional dyz, dzx bands than the lower and bidimensional dxy, driving the system through the Lifshitz transition from two-band to single band behavior. The quantitative analysis of experimental data evidences the roles of disorder, apparent in the depletion regime, and temperature. Noteworthy, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns in crystalline and amorphous samples, at least in qualitative terms, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable strong coupling in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface for optical modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the exciton\`s nonradiative decay rate. These results highlight how hybrid-2D excitonic metasurfaces offer novel opportunities to realize nanophotonic devices for active wavefront manipulation and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Tunable Ultra-Strong Magnon-Magnon Coupling Approaching the Deep-Strong Regime in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum coupling rate of 0.91. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from the gap size from the measured spectrum with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter and show that the gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited for the ultra-strong coupling regime. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime by engineering the magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the potential of vdW AFMs as a model case to study magnetisation dynamics in low-symmetry magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermi sea of a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which governs its conductance quantization and is characterized by the Euler characteristic ($\chi_F$). In contrast to the well-known band topology, which is determined by the global features of wave functions, the topology of such metallic systems is intrinsically linked to the geometry of the Fermi sea. As a result, probing and identifying $\chi_F$ in high-dimensional systems presents a challenge. Here, we propose a generic dimensional reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the features of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces. Moreover, we reveal that $\chi_F$ can be interpreted as a topological invariant of band topology by mapping a metallic system to a gapped system. Building on this nontrivial result, we identify a broad class of topological superconductors (SCs) whose topological numbers are precisely determined by the $\chi_F$ of their normally filled bands. This provides an indirect method to capture $\chi_F$ by measuring the (pseudo)spin polarizations of these topological SCs. Our findings are expected to significantly advance research into Fermi sea topology.</description>

      <title>Josephson junction of minimally twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport properties of Josephson junctions composed of superconductor/minimally twisted bilayer graphene/superconductor structures. In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.</description>

Abstract: Zero energy eigenstates $\psi_0(\theta)$ of the twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonian at the Dirac point show a high sensitivity to the twist angle $\theta$ near the magic angles where the effective Fermi velocity vanishes. We use information theory markers, like fidelity-susceptibility and entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix to the layer sector, to capture this quantum criticality of zero modes at magic twist angles.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that links mechanics and magnetism. Despite being discovered over a century ago, it remains significant in contemporary science, particularly within the fields of spintronics and ultrafast magnetism. Recent predictions suggest that the EdH effect may be realized in topological magnon systems, potentially leading to even richer properties. In this perspective, we introduce recent advancements in the EdH effect and discuss its developments in three key aspects: the microscopic mechanism, its manifestation in topological systems, and chirality-selective magnon-phonon coupling. Our discussions aim to inspire further explorations of the EdH effect and highlight its promising applications in different areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to tune the energy gap in bilayer graphene makes it the perfect playground for the study of the effects of internal electric fields, such as the crystalline field, which are developed \Reb{when other layered materials are deposited on top of it}. Here, we introduce a novel device architecture allowing a simultaneous control over the applied displacement field and the crystalline alignment between two materials. Our experimental and numerical results confirm that the crystal field and electrostatic doping due to the interface reflect the 120$^{\circ}$ symmetry of the bilayer graphene/BN heterostructure and are highly affected by the commensurate state. These results provide an unique insight into the role of twist angle in the development of internal crystal fields and intrinsic electrostatic doping in heterostructures. Our results highlight the importance of layer alignment, beyond the existence of a moir\'e superlattice, to understand the intrinsic properties of a heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</description>

Abstract: $FeCr_2S_4$ is a ferrimagnet with two oppositely ordered spin sublattices (Fe and Cr), connected via superexchange interaction, giving a non-zero net magnetic moment. We show, using time-resolved measurements of the magneto-optic Kerr effect, how the magnetic dynamics of the sublattices can be selectively manipulated by resonantly perturbing the Fe sublattice with ultrashort laser pulses. The mid-infrared excitation through intra-atomic Fe $d$-$d$ transitions triggers markedly slower dynamics in comparison to an off-resonant pumping affecting both of the two sublattices simultaneously. By changing probe wavelength to move in and out of resonance with the Fe $d$-$d$ transitions, we also show the specific contributions of the Fe sublattice to these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of unconventional spin Hall effect and antisymmetric planar Hall effect in IrO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. However, the correlation between USHE and APHE remains largely unexplored. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis confirms the coexistence of USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder in the heterogeneous material stack of semiconductor spin qubit systems introduces noise that compromises quantum information processing, posing a challenge to coherently control large-scale quantum devices. Here, we exploit low-disorder epitaxial strained quantum wells in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers to comprehensively probe the noise properties of complex micron-scale devices comprising of up to ten quantum dots and four rf-charge sensors arranged in a two-dimensional array. We demonstrate an average charge noise of $\sqrt{S_{0}}=0.3(1)$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz across different locations on the wafer, providing a benchmark for quantum confined holes. We then establish hole-spin qubit control in these heterostructures and extend our investigation from electrical to magnetic noise through spin echo measurements. Exploiting dynamical decoupling sequences, we quantify the power spectral density components arising from the hyperfine interaction with $^{73}$Ge spinful isotopes and identify coherence modulations associated with the interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin bath near the Ge quantum well. We estimate an integrated hyperfine noise amplitude $\sigma_f$ of 180(8) kHz from $^{73}$Ge and of 47(5) kHz from $^{29}$Si, underscoring the need for full isotopic purification of the qubit host environment.</description>

      <title>Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor and wavepacket dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the local geometry of quantum states, and its components directly account for the dynamical effects observed, e.g., in condensed matter systems. In this work, we address the problem of extending the QGT formalism to non-Hermitian systems with gain and loss. In particular, we investigate a wave-packet dynamics in two-band non-Hermitian systems to elucidate how non-Hermiticity affects the definition of QGT. We employ first-order perturbation theory to account for non-adiabatic corrections due to interband mixing. Our results suggest that two different generalizations of the QGT, one defined using only the right eigenstates and the other one using both the left and right eigenstates, both play a significant role in wave-packet dynamics. We then determine the accuracy of the perturbative approach by simulating a wave-packet dynamics in a well studied physical non-Hermitian system -- exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. Our work aids deeper understanding of quantum geometry and dynamical behaviour in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional 10-qubit array in germanium with robust and localised qubit control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for \textit{in situ} electric fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the interaction also causes a large qubit variability due to strong g-tensor anisotropy and dependence on the environment. Here, we leverage advances in material growth, device fabrication, and qubit control to realise a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array, with qubits coupled up to four neighbours that can be controlled with high fidelity. By exploring the large parameter space of gate voltages and quantum dot occupancies, we demonstrate that plunger gate driving in the three-hole occupation enhances electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), creating a highly localised qubit drive. Our findings, confirmed with analytical and numerical models, highlight the crucial role of intradot Coulomb interaction and magnetic field direction. Furthermore, the ability to engineer qubits for robust control is a key asset for further scaling.</description>

      <title>DPmoire: A tool for constructing accurate machine learning force fields in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In moir\'e systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moir\'e structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moir\'e systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spin currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>

      <title>Site-selective polar compensation of Mott electrons in a double perovskite heterointerface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double perovskite oxides (DPOs) with two transition metal ions ($A_2$$BB^\prime$O$_6$) offer a fascinating platform for exploring exotic physics and practical applications. Studying these DPOs as ultrathin epitaxial thin films on single crystalline substrates can add another dimension to engineering electronic, magnetic, and topological phenomena. Understanding the consequence of polarity mismatch between the substrate and the DPO would be the first step towards this broad goal. We investigate this by studying the interface between a prototypical insulating DPO Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and a wide-band gap insulator SrTiO$_3$. The interface is found to be insulating in nature. By combining several experimental techniques and density functional theory, we establish a site-selective charge compensation process that occurs explicitly at the Mn site of the film, leaving the Ni sites inert. We further demonstrate that such surprising selectivity, which cannot be explained by existing mechanisms of polarity compensation, is directly associated with their electronic correlation energy scales. This study establishes the crucial role of Mott physics in polar compensation process and paves the way for designer doping strategies in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation from a microwave field to a solid-state magnon mode. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.</description>

Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that often arise from a complex interplay between microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanisms and guided us in manipulating the dynamical properties of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanisms between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to discoveries of the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>
