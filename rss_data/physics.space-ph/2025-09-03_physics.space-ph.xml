      <title>Pinching of ICME Flux Rope: Unprecedented Multipoint Observations of Internal Magnetic Reconnection during Gannon's Superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme solar storm of May 10, 2024, during the 25th solar cycle, which recorded a symmetric H component index (Sym-H) reaching -500 nT, was the strongest since the 2003 Halloween storm. This event offered a unique opportunity for unprecedented multipoint observation of the complex interaction of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICME) from different vantage points. Utilizing NASA's Wind, ACE, DSCOVR, THEMIS-C, STEREO-A, MMS, and ISRO's recently launched Aditya-L1 spacecraft, we comprehensively investigated the spatio-temporal variations in interplanetary plasma and magnetic field parameters. Our study reveals large-scale quasi-steady magnetic reconnection within the interior of the ICME flux rope, possibly triggered by interactions between multiple ICMEs. A current sheet (CS) forms within the flux rope, enabling internal magnetic reconnection between concentric magnetic surfaces, which leads to a sharp reversal of the IMF By component, as observed at the L1 point. Concurrently, reconnection exhaust and enhanced electron and ion fluxes were detected with the CS, extending over 200 RE (1.3 million km) along the GSE-y direction. This finding sheds new light on the role of internal reconnection in ICME evolution, highlighting its pivotal role in modifying the morphology of the ICME magnetic structure and exerting severe space weather effects on Earth.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate- and Extremely High-Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- to 5+ and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant ones influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called "potentiality". We focus on the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has been unclear from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL extracted solar wind velocity as the predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1+) and high-Kp ranges under southward IMF. In this study, the IMF three components, solar wind speed, and plasma density from the OMNI database (1998-2019), covering solar cycle 23 to early 25, were used as inputs. Again, PL selected solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for moderate and extremely high Kp. The potentiality of solar wind density for these ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than in the previous study, suggesting its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as PL inputs under all Kp levels. Above moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind if density is large, suggesting that not only velocity but also density contributes significantly. These PL and statistical investigations show that solar wind density begins to regulate Kp above moderate geomagnetic activity under southward IMF. They also help understand the relationship between solar wind and geomagnetic activity and forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>Mass Translation and Reflectivity Device Solar Sail Momentum Management Using Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar sails enable propellant-free space missions by utilizing solar radiation pressure as thrust. However, disturbance torques act on the solar sail and effective attitude control leads to the continuous accumulation of reaction wheel angular momentum, necessitating an efficient momentum management strategy to prevent saturation. This paper presents a novel momentum management controller using model predictive control (MPC) that is tailored for solar sails, accommodating the unique actuation mechanisms of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs). A first-order hold discretization and tailored motion costs are applied to the AMT translation, while the RCD actuation is handled using pulse-width modulation (PWM)-inspired quantization to address their on-off inputs. To enhance prediction accuracy, an iterative backwards-in-time MPC approach is introduced, incorporating the effects of PWM-quantized inputs into the optimization process. The dynamic model accounts for the time-dependent center of mass and moment of inertia changes caused by AMT translation, extending its applicability to other spacecraft with mass-shifting actuators. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reaction wheel desaturation, attitude control, and momentum management actuation efficiency, highlighting the potential of integrating MPC to manage coupled nonlinear dynamics and discrete actuator constraints for solar sails.</description>

      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1-Score of 0.37, with an average detection delay of 24.5% of the event's duration while processing only a minimal portion of the event data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and resonant ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>
