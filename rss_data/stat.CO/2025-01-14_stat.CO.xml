      <title>Fast Approximate Solution of Stein Equations for Post-Processing of MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is conceptually elegant, but calculating posterior expectations can entail a heavy computational cost. Monte Carlo methods are reliable and supported by strong asymptotic guarantees, but do not leverage smoothness of the integrand. Solving Stein equations has emerged as a possible alternative, providing a framework for numerical approximation of posterior expectations in which smoothness can be exploited. However, existing numerical methods for Stein equations are associated with high computational cost due to the need to solve large linear systems. This paper considers the combination of iterative linear solvers and preconditioning strategies to obtain fast approximate solutions of Stein equations. Our main finding is that these methods can be effective, but that the performance of different preconditioning strategies is context-dependent, so that no single strategy can be universally preferred.</description>

      <title>Parallel ADMM Algorithm with Gaussian Back Substitution for High-Dimensional Quantile Regression and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of high-dimensional data analysis, modeling methods based on quantile loss function are highly regarded due to their ability to provide a comprehensive statistical perspective and effective handling of heterogeneous data. In recent years, many studies have focused on using the parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (P-ADMM) to solve high-dimensional quantile regression and classification problems. One efficient strategy is to reformulate the quantile loss function by introducing slack variables. However, this reformulation introduces a theoretical challenge: even when the regularization term is convex, the convergence of the algorithm cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Gaussian Back-Substitution strategy, which requires only a simple and effective correction step that can be easily integrated into existing parallel algorithm frameworks, achieving a linear convergence rate. Furthermore, this paper extends the parallel algorithm to handle some novel quantile loss classification models. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed modified P-ADMM algorithm exhibits excellent performance in terms of reliability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>CMHSU: An R Statistical Software Package to Detect Mental Health Status, Substance Use Status, and their Concurrent Status in the North American Healthcare Administrative Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of concurrent mental health and substance use (MHSU) and its detection in patients has garnered growing interest among psychiatrists and healthcare policymakers over the past four decades. Researchers have proposed various diagnostic methods, including the Data-Driven Diagnostic Method (DDDM), for the identification of MHSU. However, the absence of a standalone statistical software package to facilitate DDDM for large healthcare administrative databases has remained a significant gap. This paper introduces the R statistical software package CMHSU , available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), for the diagnosis of mental health (MH), substance use (SU), and their concurrent status (MHSU). The package implements DDDM using hospital and medical service physician visit counts along with maximum time span parameters for MH, SU, and MHSU diagnoses. A working example with a simulated real-world dataset is presented to explore three critical dimensions of MHSU detection based on the DDDM. Additionally, the limitations of the CMHSU package and potential directions for its future extension are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Beta Cauchy-Cauchy (BECCA) shrinkage prior for Bayesian variable selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Bayesian approach for variable selection in high-dimensional and potentially sparse regression settings. Our method replaces the indicator variables in the traditional spike and slab prior with continuous, Beta-distributed random variables and places half Cauchy priors over the parameters of the Beta distribution, which significantly improves the predictive and inferential performance of the technique. Similar to shrinkage methods, our continuous parameterization of the spike and slab prior enables us explore the posterior distributions of interest using fast gradient-based methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), while at the same time explicitly allowing for variable selection in a principled framework. We study the frequentist properties of our model via simulation and show that our technique outperforms the latest Bayesian variable selection methods in both linear and logistic regression. The efficacy, applicability and performance of our approach, are further underscored through its implementation on real datasets.</description>

      <title>CDsampling: An R Package for Constrained D-Optimal Sampling in Paid Research Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of paid research studies and clinical trials, budget considerations often require patient sampling from available populations which comes with inherent constraints. We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, it revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian variable selection using an informed reversible jump in imaging genetics: an application to schizophrenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a practical perspective, proposals are one of the main bottleneck for any Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. This paper suggests a novel data driven or informed proposal for reversible jump MCMC for Bayesian variable selection in the context of predictive risk assessment for schizophrenia based on imaging genetic data. Given functional Magnetic Resonance Image and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms information of healthy and people diagnosed with schizophrenia, we use a Bayesian probit model to select discriminating variables for inferential purposes, while to estimate the predictive risk, the most promising models are combined using a Bayesian model averaging scheme.</description>

      <title>Approximations to worst-case data dropping: unmasking failure modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A data analyst might worry about generalization if dropping a very small fraction of data points from a study could change its substantive conclusions. Finding the worst-case data subset to drop poses a combinatorial optimization problem. To overcome this intractability, recent works propose using additive approximations, which treat the contribution of a collection of data points as the sum of their individual contributions, and greedy approximations, which iteratively select the point with the highest impact to drop and re-run the data analysis without that point [Broderick et al., 2020, Kuschnig et al., 2021]. We identify that, even in a setting as simple as OLS linear regression, many of these approximations can break down in realistic data arrangements. Several of our examples reflect masking, where one outlier may hide or conceal the effect of another outlier. Based on the failures we identify, we provide recommendations for users and suggest directions for future improvements.</description>
