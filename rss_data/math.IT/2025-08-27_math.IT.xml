      <title>Multi-Resolution Codebook Design and Multiuser Interference Management for Discrete XL-RIS-Aided Near-Field MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) can effectively overcome severe fading and provide higher communication performance. However, current research on XL-RIS overlooks the discrete phase-shift characteristics of RIS in practical systems, which will result in significant performance degradation.In this paper, we investigate near-field communication schemes assisted by XL-RIS with discrete phase shifts.Specifically, we propose a hierarchical beam training method to obtain the user channel state information (CSI), and develop the jointly optimized codebook construction (JOCC) method and separately optimized codebook construction (SOCC) method for base station (BS) precoding and XL-RIS phase shifts, respectively. With JOCC, the most superior beam training performance can be obtained.With SOCC, higher performance than the single-antenna BS codebook can be obtained at a similar complexity.Further, we propose a flexible multiuser interference management (IM) method that is simple to solve. The IM method uses adaptive gain matrix approximation to take into account user fairness and can be solved in closed-form iterations. In addition, we extend the proposed method to a hybrid precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-resolution codebook construction method can obtain more accurate beam patterns and user CSI, and the proposed IM method obtains superior performance over the benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Position Statistics and Fisher Information in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a closed-form characterization of the joint distribution of first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Prior studies have investigated FAT modeling via inverse Gaussian distributions [1] and applied FAT statistics for parameter estimation and synchronization tasks [2], [3], while more recent work has characterized FAP for spatial channel analysis [4]. In contrast, we derive an explicit joint probability density function (PDF) under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Our result reveals a nontrivial coupling between arrival time and lateral position, generalizing known inverse Gaussian models. We further compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to key channel parameters, showing that the joint observation enables estimation of lateral drift and improves sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient -- capabilities not achievable with time-only or position-only models. This joint framework enhances the modeling and inference capabilities for molecular communication channels where spatial randomness itself carries non-negligible information.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Target Detection by Exploiting Both Deterministic Pilots and Unknown Random Data Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) plays a crucial role in 6G, to enable innovative applications such as drone surveillance, urban air mobility, and low-altitude logistics. However, the hybrid ISAC signal, which comprises deterministic pilot and random data payload components, poses challenges for target detection due to two reasons: 1) these two components cause coupled shifts in both the mean and variance of the received signal, and 2) the random data payloads are typically unknown to the sensing receiver in the bistatic setting. Unfortunately, these challenges could not be tackled by existing target detection algorithms. In this paper, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detector is derived, by leveraging the known deterministic pilots and the statistical characteristics of the unknown random data payloads. Due to the analytical intractability of exact performance characterization, we perform an asymptotic analysis for the false alarm probability and detection probability of the proposed detector. The results highlight a critical trade-off: both deterministic and random components improve detection reliability, but the latter also brings statistical uncertainty that hinders detection performance. Simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector, which highlights the necessity of designing a dedicated detector to fully exploited the signaling resources assigned to random data payloads.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for LL traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.</description>

      <title>On decoding extended Han-Zhang codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Han-Zhang codes are a class of linear codes where each code is either a non-generalized Reed-Solomon (non-GRS) maximum distance separable (MDS) code or a near MDS (NMDS) code. They have important applications in communication, cryptography, and storage systems. While many algebraic properties and explicit constructions of extended Han-Zhang codes have been well studied in the literature, their decoding has been unexplored. In this paper, we focus on their decoding problems in terms of $\ell$-error-correcting pairs ($\ell$-ECPs) and deep holes. On the one hand, we determine the existence and specific forms of their $\ell$-ECPs, and further present an explicit decoding algorithm for extended Han-Zhang codes based on these $\ell$-ECPs, which can correct up to $\ell$ errors in polynomial time, with $\ell$ about half of the minimum distance. On the other hand, we determine the covering radius of extended Han-Zhang codes and characterize two classes of their deep holes, which are closely related to the maximum-likelihood decoding method. By employing these deep holes, we also construct more non-GRS MDS codes with larger lengths and dimensions, and discuss the monomial equivalence between them and the well-known Roth-Lempel codes. Some concrete examples are also given to support these results.</description>

      <title>The fundamental limits of minimax risk for high-dimensional speckle noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which are often well described by a linear regression framework, coherent imaging systems follow a significantly more complex model. In these systems, the task is to recover the unknown signal or image $\mathbf{x}_o \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from observations $\mathbf{y}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{y}_L \in \mathbb{R}^m$ of the form \[ \mathbf{y}_l = A_l X_o \mathbf{w}_l + \mathbf{z}_l, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L, \] where $X_o = \mathrm{diag}(\mathbf{x}_o)$ is an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix, $\mathbf{w}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$ represent speckle noise, and $\mathbf{z}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_L \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_z^2 I_m)$ denote additive noise. The matrices $A_1, \ldots, A_L$ are known forward operators determined by the imaging system.
  Our goal is to characterize the minimax risk of estimating $\mathbf{x}_o$, in high-dimensional settings where $m$ could be even less than $n$. Motivated by insights from sparse regression, we note that the structure of $\mathbf{x}_o$ plays a central role in the estimation error. Here, we adopt a general notion of structure better suited to coherent imaging: we assume that $\mathbf{x}_o$ lies in a signal class $\mathcal{C}_k$ whose Minkowski dimension is bounded by $k \ll n$.
  We show that, when $A_1,\ldots,A_L$ are independent $m \times n$ Gaussian matrices, the minimax mean squared error (MSE) scales as \[ \frac{\max\{\sigma_z^4,\, m^2,\, n^2\}\, k \log n}{m^2 n L}. \]</description>

      <title>Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification. High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers, bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates $\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction, achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Toward Edge General Intelligence with Agentic AI and Agentification: Concepts, Technologies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed the evolution from centralized cloud intelligence towards decentralized edge general intelligence. However, traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution, enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence. First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze important enabling technologies, including compact model compression, energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms. Third, we provide representative case studies demonstrating Agentic AI's capabilities in low-altitude economy networks, intent-driven networking, vehicular networks, and human-centric service provisioning, supported by numerical evaluations. Furthermore, we identify current research challenges, review emerging open-source platforms, and highlight promising future research directions to guide robust, scalable, and trustworthy Agentic AI deployments for next-generation edge environments.</description>

      <title>A Tight Context-aware Privacy Bound for Histogram Publication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the privacy guarantees of the Laplace mechanism releasing the histogram of a dataset through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). While differential privacy is commonly used to quantify the privacy loss, it is a context-free definition that does not depend on the data distribution. In contrast, PML enables a more refined analysis by incorporating assumptions about the data distribution. We show that when the probability of each histogram bin is bounded away from zero, stronger privacy protection can be achieved for a fixed level of noise. Our results demonstrate the advantage of context-aware privacy measures and show that incorporating assumptions about the data can improve privacy-utility tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Tackling Federated Unlearning as a Parameter Estimation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at complexity that is only sublinear in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Identification over Affine Poisson Channels: Application to Molecular Mixture Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11569v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification capacity has been established as a relevant performance metric for various goal-/task-oriented applications, where the receiver may be interested in only a particular message that represents an event or a task. For example, in olfactory molecular communications (MCs), odors or pheromones, which are often a mixture of various molecule types, may signal nearby danger, food, or a mate. In this paper, we examine the identification capacity with deterministic encoder for the discrete affine Poisson channel which can be used to model MC systems with molecule counting receivers. We establish lower and upper bounds on the identification capacity in terms of features of the affinity matrix between the released molecules and receptors at the receiver. As a key finding, we show that even when the number of receptor types scales sub-linearly in the number of molecule types $N,$ the number of reliably identifiable messages can grow super-exponentially with the rank of the affinity matrix, $T,$ i.e., $\sim 2^{(T \log T)R},$ where $R$ denotes the coding rate. We further derive lower and upper bounds on $R,$ and show that the proposed capacity theorem includes several known results in the literature as its special cases.</description>

      <title>Deviation Inequalities for R\'{e}nyi Divergence Estimators via Variational Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R\'enyi divergences play a pivotal role in information theory, statistics, and machine learning. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature with their consistency properties established and minimax convergence rates quantified, existing accounts of probabilistic bounds governing the estimation error are relatively underdeveloped. Here, we make progress in this regard by establishing exponential deviation inequalities for smoothed plug-in estimators and neural estimators by relating the error to an appropriate empirical process and leveraging tools from empirical process theory. In particular, our approach does not require the underlying distributions to be compactly supported or have densities bounded away from zero, an assumption prevalent in existing results. The deviation inequality also leads to a one-sided concentration bound from the expectation, which is useful in random-coding arguments over continuous alphabets in information theory with potential applications to physical-layer security. As another concrete application, we consider a hypothesis testing framework for auditing R\'{e}nyi differential privacy using the neural estimator as a test statistic and obtain non-asymptotic performance guarantees for such a test.</description>

      <title>Average Achievable Rate Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO in the Finite Blocklength Regime with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI) introduces substantial challenges in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems, primarily due to the large dimensionality of channel parameters, especially under ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) constraints. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect CSI on the average achievable rate within the finite blocklength regime remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, this paper proposes a novel analytical framework that provides a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate with imperfect CSI in the Laplace domain. We demonstrate analytically that both the channel dispersion and the expected channel capacity can be expressed explicitly in terms of the Laplace transform of the large-scale fading component. Numerical simulations confirm that the derived expressions match closely with Monte Carlo simulations, verifying their accuracy. Furthermore, we theoretically show that although imperfect CSI degrades performance in the finite blocklength regime, the inherent characteristics of CF-mMIMO architecture effectively mitigates this loss.</description>

      <title>Advancing Free-Space Optical Communication System Architecture: Performance Analysis of Varied Optical Ground Station Network Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study discusses the current state of FSO technology, as well as global trends and developments in the industrial ecosystem to identify obstacles to the full realization of optical space-to-ground communication networks. Additionally, link performance and network availability trade-off studies are presented, comparing overall system performance between portable and large OGS networks in conjunction with a constellation of small low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The paper provides an up-to-date overview and critical analysis of the FSO industry and assesses the feasibility of low-cost portable terminals as an alternative to larger high-capacity OGS systems. This initiative aims to better inform optical communications stakeholders, including governments, academic institutions, satellite operators, manufacturers, and communication service providers</description>

      <title>Targeted Clifford logical gates for hypergraph product codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with an explicit framework for designing logical Clifford circuits for CSS codes, we construct logical gates for Hypergraph Product Codes. We first derive symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group. This enables us to design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary codes in this family. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the $[[18,2,3]]$ toric code.</description>

      <title>Distribution free M-estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.</description>
