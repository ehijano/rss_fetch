      <title>Are there stars in Bluesky after the return of Donald Trump to the White House?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the shift in the scientific community from X (formerly Twitter) to Bluesky, its impact on scientific communication, and consequently on social metrics (altmetrics). We analysed 14,497 publications from multidisciplinary and Library and Information Science (LIS) journals between January 2024 and March 2025. The results reveal a notable increase in Bluesky activity for multidisciplinary journals in November 2024, likely influenced by political and platform changes, with mentions multiplying for journals like Nature and Science. In LIS, the adoption of Bluesky is different and shows marked variation between European and United States journals. Although Bluesky remains a minority platform compared to X over the whole period, when focusing on user engagement after the United States elections, we see a much more even distribution between the two platforms. In two LIS journals, Bluesky even surpasses X, while in most others, the difference in user engagement was no longer as pronounced, marking a significant change from previous patterns in altmetrics.</description>

      <title>Identity resolution of software metadata using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</description>

      <title>BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</description>

      <title>SciHorizon: Benchmarking AI-for-Science Readiness from Scientific Data to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the paradigm of scientific discovery, establishing AI-for-Science (AI4Science) as a dynamic and evolving field. However, there is still a lack of an effective framework for the overall assessment of AI4Science, particularly from a holistic perspective on data quality and model capability. Therefore, in this study, we propose SciHorizon, a comprehensive assessment framework designed to benchmark the readiness of AI4Science from both scientific data and LLM perspectives. First, we introduce a generalizable framework for assessing AI-ready scientific data, encompassing four key dimensions: Quality, FAIRness, Explainability, and Compliance-which are subdivided into 15 sub-dimensions. Drawing on data resource papers published between 2018 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals, we present recommendation lists of AI-ready datasets for Earth, Life, and Materials Sciences, making a novel and original contribution to the field. Concurrently, to assess the capabilities of LLMs across multiple scientific disciplines, we establish 16 assessment dimensions based on five core indicators Knowledge, Understanding, Reasoning, Multimodality, and Values spanning Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Earth and Space Sciences. Using the developed benchmark datasets, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of over 50 representative open-source and closed source LLMs. All the results are publicly available and can be accessed online at www.scihorizon.cn/en.</description>
