      <title>A Semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Model for Chest CT-based 3D Blood Vessel Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) has been a powerful diagnostic tool since its emergence in the 1970s. Using CT data, three-dimensional (3D) structures of human internal organs and tissues, such as blood vessels, can be reconstructed using professional software. This 3D reconstruction is crucial for surgical operations and can serve as a vivid medical teaching example. However, traditional 3D reconstruction heavily relies on manual operations, which are time-consuming, subjective, and require substantial experience. To address this problem, we develop a novel semiparametric Gaussian mixture model tailored for the 3D reconstruction of blood vessels. This model extends the classical Gaussian mixture model by enabling nonparametric variations in the component-wise parameters of interest according to voxel positions. We develop a kernel-based expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating the model parameters, accompanied by a supporting asymptotic theory. Furthermore, we propose a novel regression method for optimal bandwidth selection. Compared to the conventional cross-validation-based (CV) method, the regression method outperforms the CV method in terms of computational and statistical efficiency. In application, this methodology facilitates the fully automated reconstruction of 3D blood vessel structures with remarkable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric conditional risk mapping under heteroscedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonparametric procedure to estimate the conditional probability that a nonstationary geostatistical process exceeds a certain threshold value is proposed. The method consists of a bootstrap algorithm that combines conditional simulation techniques with nonparametric estimations of the trend and the variability. The nonparametric local linear estimator, considering a bandwidth matrix selected by a method that takes the spatial dependence into account, is used to estimate the trend. The variability is modeled estimating the conditional variance and the variogram from corrected residuals to avoid the biasses. The proposed method allows to obtain estimates of the conditional exceedance risk in non-observed spatial locations. The performance of the approach is analyzed by simulation and illustrated with the application to a real data set of precipitations in the U.S.</description>

      <title>Dual-Frequency Radar Wave-Inversion for Sub-Surface Material Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moisture estimation of sub-surface soil and the overlaying biomass layer is pivotal in precision agriculture and wildfire risk assessment. However, the characterization of layered material is nontrivial due to the radar penetration-resolution tradeoff. Here, a waveform inversion-based method was proposed for predicting the dielectric permittivity (as a moisture proxy) of the bottom soil layer and the top biomass layer from radar signals. Specifically, the use of a combination of a higher and a lower frequency radar compared to a single frequency in predicting the permittivity of both the soil and the overlaying layer was investigated in this study. The results show that each layer was best characterized via one of the frequencies. However, for the simultaneous prediction of both layers permittivity, the most consistent results were achieved by inversion of data from a combination of both frequencies, showing better correlation with in situ permittivity and reduced prediction errors.</description>

      <title>Novel approaches to urban science problems: human mobility description by physical analogy of electric circuit network based on GPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility in an urban area is complicated; the origins, destinations, and transport methods of each person differ. The quantitative description of urban human mobility has recently attracted the attention of researchers, and it highly related to urban science problems. Herein, combined with physics inspiration, we introduce a revised electric circuit model (RECM) in which moving people are regarded as charged particles and analogical concepts of electromagnetism such as human conductivity and human potential enable us to capture the characteristics of urban human mobility. We introduce the unit system, ensure the uniqueness of the calculation result, and reduce the computation cost of the algorithm to 1/10000 compared with the original ECM, making the model more universal and easier to use. We compared features including human conductivity and potential between different cities in Japan to show our improvement of the universality and the application range of the model. Furthermore, based on inspiration of physics, we propose a route generation model (RGM) to simulate a human flow pattern that automatically determines suitable routes between a given origin and destination as a source and sink, respectively. These discoveries are expected to lead to new approaches to the solution of urban science problems.</description>

      <title>Bias versus variance when fitting multi-species molecular lines with a non-LTE radiative transfer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust radiative transfer techniques are requisite for efficiently extracting the physical and chemical information from molecular rotational lines.We study several hypotheses that enable robust estimations of the column densities and physical conditions when fitting one or two transitions per molecular species. We study the extent to which simplifying assumptions aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem introduce estimation biases and how to detect them.We focus on the CO and HCO+ isotopologues and analyze maps of a 50 square arcminutes field. We used the RADEX escape probability model to solve the statistical equilibrium equations and compute the emerging line profiles, assuming that all species coexist. Depending on the considered set of species, we also fixed the abundance ratio between some species and explored different values. We proposed a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions and considered the effect of both the thermal noise and calibration uncertainty. We analyzed any potential biases induced by model misspecifications by comparing the results on the actual data for several sets of species and confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. The variance of the estimations and the efficiency of the estimator were studied based on the Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound.Column densities can be estimated with 30% accuracy, while the best estimations of the volume density are found to be within a factor of two. Under the chosen model framework, the peak 12CO(1--0) is useful for constraining the kinetic temperature. The thermal pressure is better and more robustly estimated than the volume density and kinetic temperature separately. Analyzing CO and HCO+ isotopologues and fitting the full line profile are recommended practices with respect to detecting possible biases.Combining a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model with a rigorous analysis of the accuracy allows us to obtain an efficient estimator and identify where the model is misspecified. We note that other combinations of molecular lines could be studied in the future.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph adjusted plus-minus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In team sports, traditional ranking statistics do not allow for the simultaneous evaluation of both individuals and combinations of players. Metrics for individual player rankings often fail to consider the interaction effects between groups of players, while methods for assessing full lineups cannot be used to identify the value of lower-order combinations of players (pairs, trios, etc.). Given that player and lineup rankings are inherently dependent on each other, these limitations may affect the accuracy of performance evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel adjusted box score plus-minus (APM) approach that allows for the simultaneous ranking of individual players, lower-order combinations of players, and full lineups. The method adjusts for the complete dependency structure and is motivated by the connection between APM and the hypergraph representation of a team. We discuss the similarities of our approach to other advanced metrics, demonstrate it using NBA data from 2012-2022, and suggest potential directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Square Root LASSO: Well-posedness, Lipschitz stability and the tuning trade off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies well-posedness and parameter sensitivity of the Square Root LASSO (SR-LASSO), an optimization model for recovering sparse solutions to linear inverse problems in finite dimension. An advantage of the SR-LASSO (e.g., over the standard LASSO) is that the optimal tuning of the regularization parameter is robust with respect to measurement noise. This paper provides three point-based regularity conditions at a solution of the SR-LASSO: the weak, intermediate, and strong assumptions. It is shown that the weak assumption implies uniqueness of the solution in question. The intermediate assumption yields a directionally differentiable and locally Lipschitz solution map (with explicit Lipschitz bounds), whereas the strong assumption gives continuous differentiability of said map around the point in question. Our analysis leads to new theoretical insights on the comparison between SR-LASSO and LASSO from the viewpoint of tuning parameter sensitivity: noise-robust optimal parameter choice for SR-LASSO comes at the "price" of elevated tuning parameter sensitivity. Numerical results support and showcase the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient and Surrogate-Based Design Optimization of Underwater Vehicle Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics simulations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are a computational bottleneck in computer-aided design (CAD) optimization processes. To overcome this bottleneck, one requires either an optimization framework that is highly sample-efficient, or a fast data-driven proxy (surrogate model) for long-running simulations. Both approaches have benefits and limitations. Bayesian optimization is often used for sample efficiency, but it solves one specific problem and struggles with transferability; alternatively, surrogate models can offer fast and often more generalizable solutions for CFD problems, but gathering data for and training such models can be computationally demanding. In this work, we leverage recent advances in optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore both of these potential approaches, in the context of designing an optimal unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hull. Our study finds that the Bayesian Optimization-Lower Condition Bound (BO-LCB) algorithm is the most sample-efficient optimization framework and has the best convergence behavior of those considered. Subsequently, we show that our DNN-based surrogate model predicts drag force on test data in tight agreement with CFD simulations, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85%. Combining these results, we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup (with comparable accuracy) for the design optimization process when the surrogate model is used. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying Bayesian optimization and DNN-based surrogate modeling to the problem of UUV design optimization, and we share our developments as open-source software.</description>

      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>

      <title>Emotion Detection with Transformers: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of transformer-based models for emotion classification on text data. We train and evaluate several pre-trained transformer models, on the Emotion dataset using different variants of transformers. The paper also analyzes some factors that in-fluence the performance of the model, such as the fine-tuning of the transformer layer, the trainability of the layer, and the preprocessing of the text data. Our analysis reveals that commonly applied techniques like removing punctuation and stop words can hinder model performance. This might be because transformers strength lies in understanding contextual relationships within text. Elements like punctuation and stop words can still convey sentiment or emphasis and removing them might disrupt this context.</description>
