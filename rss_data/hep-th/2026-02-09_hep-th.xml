      <title>Stable Causality and Microcausality for Drummond-Hathrell Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local superluminal photon propagation arises at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/m_e^2)$ in the Drummond Hathrell (DH) effective action obtained by integrating out the electron in QED coupled to gravity. Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.
  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.
  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double-Scaled SYK &amp; Reaching the Stretched Horizon From Finite Cutoff Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</description>

      <title>On the $(\text{Fib} \boxtimes \text{Fib}) \rtimes S_2$ fusion category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There might exist non-rational Virasoro CFTs in two dimensions with a $(\text{Fib} \boxtimes \text{Fib}) \rtimes S_2$ categorical symmetry. We calculate the necessary ingredients for a modular conformal bootstrap analysis of these theories. After reviewing the basics of fusion categories, we present the irreducible representations, the lasso maps that intertwine between different Hilbert spaces, and finally the 22-by-22 modular S matrix. We highlight the peculiarities introduced by the non-invertible nature of the symmetry. This paper is written in a pedagogical manner and can therefore serve as an accessible entry point into the literature.</description>

      <title>Shear mode transport coefficients from multiple polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the transport coefficients associated with the shear sector of gravitational perturbations around asymptotically anti-de Sitter black branes. In the long-wavelength, low-frequency limit, the wave solutions admit a structure that is fully described in terms of multiple polylogarithms in several variables. We focus primarily on computing the transport coefficients for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, by performing a bulk computation in the five-dimensional black hole background up to order $\mathfrak{q}^{10}$, which extends the results previously available in the literature. We then generalise the procedure to $d+1$ dimensions, characterising the mathematical structure of the resulting transport coefficient expressions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering in Spinless WQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the computational framework for gravitational wave - black hole scattering in worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) without spin. Crucially, we prove on general grounds that, in the absence of dissipation, the exponential representation of the $S$-matrix maps -- through a partial-wave transformation -- directly onto the scattering phase shift from black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), indicating an exponentiation of the WQFT amplitude itself in partial-wave space. Computing explicitly, we reproduce the BHPT phase shift without spin up to $O(G^{3})$ from WQFT. While this result is expected, it lays the groundwork for higher-precision analyses involving non-minimal effects. Along the way, we outline our efficient diagram generation technique and include a pedagogical discussion on the computation of the required two-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Holographic Charged Transport with Higher Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first-order hydrodynamic transport coefficients (shear viscosity $\eta$, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, and charge conductivity $\sigma$) for a broad class of strongly coupled, four-dimensional charged relativistic gauge theory plasma with holographic gravitational duals containing higher-derivative corrections. The landscape of our holographic models captures non-conformal gauge theories with an arbitrary number of relevant coupling constants and a general scalar potential in the gravitational dual, allowing for a systematic exploration of charged transport along generic holographic RG flows. The leading-order higher-derivative corrections probe gauge theories with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point, and enable the engineering of diverse temperature and charge density profiles for the viscosities and the conductivity. Our results establish the membrane paradigm in higher-derivative holographic models: all the transport coefficients are extracted from the black brane horizon values of the gravitational scalars, and various functions defining the gravitational holographic dual.</description>

      <title>Krylov Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Realization of Carrollian Conformal Symmetry through Deformed Light-Cone Null Reduction of Complex Vector Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Banerjee et al.(2018)[1] and Saha et al. (2025) [2], we utilize the deformed light-cone formalism to investigate the Carrollian version of a complex vector field theory. We find that after applying the null-reduction procedure and the Carrollian limit c $\to$ 0, the "-" null-direction and spatial components of the parent vector field decouple completely into independent scalar fields, while the "+" null-direction component vanishes. We carefully derive and demonstrate the process by which the energy-momentum tensor degrades from the Lorentzian symmetry case to the non-relativistic scenario, and point out that the secondary constraint of the original parent theory will play a crucial role in the derivation of the Carrollian generators. Finally, as expected, the resulting generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations. This work represents an extension of the application of the deformed light-cone null reduction formalism.</description>

      <title>Projective Time, Cayley Transformations and the Schwarzian Geometry of the Free Particle--Oscillator Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the one--dimensional free particle and the harmonic oscillator from a unified viewpoint based on projective geometry, Cayley transformations, and the Schwarzian derivative. Treating time as a projective coordinate on $\mathbb {RP}^1$ clarifies the $SL(2,\mathbb R)\cong Sp(2,\mathbb R)$ conformal sector of the Schr\"odinger--Jacobi symmetry and provides a common framework for two seemingly different correspondences: the Cayley--Niederer (lens) map between the time--dependent Schr\"odinger equations and the conformal bridge transformation relating the stationary problems. We formulate these relations as canonical transformations on the extended phase space and as their metaplectic lifts, identifying the quantum Cayley map with the Bargmann transform. General time reparametrizations induce oscillator--type terms governed universally by the Schwarzian cocycle, connecting the present construction to broader appearances of Schwarzian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Seeing Page Curves and Islands with Blinders On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper summarizes recent discussions of the Page curve and the information paradox, and responds to the reasoning and examples from arXiv:2506.04311. We review arguments demonstrating that in quantum gravity the algebra of observables at infinity is complete, both in AdS and in asymptotically flat space. This completeness implies that the bulk Hilbert space in quantum gravity does not factorize along the radial direction, undermining a key common assumption in Hawking's argument for information loss and in initial derivations of the Page curve. As a consequence, in a standard theory of gravity, information does not ``emerge'' from a black hole in the manner suggested by the Page curve; rather, it is already encoded in asymptotic observables. Relatedly, the full black hole interior, and not just an ``island'', can be reconstructed from exterior data. Page curves and islands can be obtained by removing the Hamiltonian from the exterior algebra. This may be implemented operationally by restricting access to part of the asymptotic region (a detector with a ``blind spot'') or, in the special case of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, by formally discarding the Hamiltonian from the set of observables despite its physical accessibility. Such Page curves describe only the redistribution of information between measured and unmeasured degrees of freedom, rather than fundamental information recovery. Finally, Page curves and islands also arise when a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath, a setup that yields a nonstandard theory of gravity. We show how, even in this setting, the unusual localization of information in gravity provides a concrete physical mechanism for information transfer from the gravitational system into the bath.</description>

      <title>Bulk Phase Shift and Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy scattering of a light particle off a black hole at fixed impact parameter is described by an eikonal phase, which encodes the resulting time delay and angular deflection. This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative corrections to line defect integrated correlators in $Sp(N)$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory with gauge group $Sp(N)$ and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory consisting of four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the rank-two antisymmetric representation of the $Sp(N)$ gauge group. Building on previous results obtained via supersymmetric localization and a Toda equation, we determine the leading non-perturbative corrections at strong coupling to the integrated correlator between a Wilson line and two Higgs-branch moment map operators. In the case of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT, the presence of truncated asymptotic expansions led us to develop a resurgent method complementary to Cheshire cat resurgence. This approach has the advantage of yielding an exact expression for the correlator in terms of an analytic function, which can subsequently be expanded in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe families of probe D$q$-brane embeddings in the extremal black D$p$-brane backgrounds of type IIA and type IIB supergravity, specified by an arbitrary holomorphic function of a complex coordinate on the worldvolume of the D$q$-branes. These embeddings preserve one-quarter of the supersymmetry of the D$p$-brane background, or sometimes one-half of the supersymmetry when $p = q$. We discuss the holography of two example families of holomorphic probe branes in the near-horizon limit of the D3-brane background. The first is probe D5-branes, dual to defect hypermultiplets with a holomorphic mass, which in the infrared flow to Wilson lines located at the zeros of the mass. The second is probe D3-branes, holographically dual to states in the presence of Gukov--Witten surface defects in the dual $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum transport phenomena induced by anisotropic Lifshitz scale anomaly in a boundary Lifshitz field theory (BLFT) coupled to an external electromagnetic background. In this context, we obtain the anisotropic scale anomaly in Lifshitz field theories coupled to a background $U(1)$ gauge field and subsequently compute the anomaly induced near boundary current in a BLFT. Focusing on 5D BLFTs, we find that the temporal and spatial components of the induced current exhibit distinct power law dependencies on the distance from the boundary, reflecting the intrinsic time-space anisotropy of the theory. We further derive this anomalous current holographically from the bulk dual of BLFT and find that the temporal component is independent of the boundary conditions while the spatial component depends explicitly on them. The distance dependence is in exact agreement with the dual field theory result.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Holes in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new black hole solutions to the low-energy effective action of string theory. We introduce three- and four-dimensional solutions that are rotating, asymptotically flat, and exhibit a linear dilaton vacuum. These solutions cannot be overspun, i.e., do not have an extremality condition, akin to higher-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with one rotational angle. Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole. As such we advocate that large-$d$ can provide a useful vantage point to interpret the here introduced black holes, as well as more generally a way to generate new effective field theories and corresponding non-trivial solutions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the classical Compton amplitude for graviton interaction with a non-spinning massive body up to the third post-Minkowskian order. Our novel result utilizes the enhanced computational efficiency provided by worldline effective field theory in a non-trivial background spacetime. Physical constraints, such as infrared factorization, provide a useful cross-check of the result and we also consider its consistency with computations in black hole perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering: a Systematic Toolkit for Tidal Effects in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for systematic computations of scattering amplitudes for gravitational Raman scattering, -- the inelastic scattering of massless fields off compact relativistic objects. We focus on the small-frequency (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime relevant for the study of tidal effects, which can be mapped onto gravitational wave observables during the inspiraling phase of a merger. We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and other macroscopic objects may be surrounded by potentially large field configurations of very light scalars coupled to ordinary matter. If the star ends in a black hole, e.g. via a supernova or a neutron star merger, the source vanishes, and the field is released. In this paper, we improve on previous estimates for the field configurations arriving at large distances by including the effects of general relativity and an improved modelling of the initial field configurations. The total amount of energy released is typically of the same order of magnitude as suggested by simple flat space estimates. The spectrum receives noticeable corrections.</description>

      <title>Consistency of standard cosmologies using Bayesian model comparison and tension quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian assessment of model comparison and data-set consistency for LCDM (cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant) and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and type Ia supernova (SN) data. The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\ell$ versus high-$\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\,\sigma$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $\tau$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature.</description>

      <title>U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Combining the Generalized and Extended Uncertainty Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) are modifications to the Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle (HUP), expected to apply as the energy approaches the Planck scale. Here we consider a possible combination of these modifications (GEUP) and analyse the implications in various regions of the ($\Delta x$, $\Delta p$) plane. We also consider an alternative combination (EGUP) which exhibits duality between $\Delta p$ and $\Delta x$, showing that this has some unusual features. The parameters which describe these models are usually assumed to be positive but we extend our analysis to include negative values. All these proposals entail a link between black holes and the various types of Uncertainty Principle. In particular, the GEUP predicts a new kind of strong-gravity black hole and this implies an interesting link between black holes and elementary particles.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of partial fraction decompositions (PFDs) in several variables using tools from commutative algebra. We give criteria for when a rational function with poles on a hyperplane arrangement has a desirable PFD. Our criteria are obtained by examining the primary decomposition of ideals coming from hyperplane arrangements. We then present an algorithm for finding a PFD that satisfies properties desired by physicists, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for computing large examples coming from Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Universality of Primordial Anisotropies in Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model-independent formalism for describing anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originating from primordial perturbations. Despite their diverse physical origins -- such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity -- SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effective Dynamics and Stability of Vacuum in Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the details of the canonical quantization of effective quantum field theories in anti-de Sitter spacetime, emphasizing the stability of the quantum vacuum. We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with \xi R\phi^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of \xi), only when \xi \le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For \xi &gt; 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for \xi\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is conventionally assumed to be chargeless, the possibility of a charged massive particle (CHAMP) as the DM particle remains alive. With phenomenological constraints on the charge being very severe, such a scenario is often sought to be dismissed, citing naturalness. We demonstrate here that such a (mini)charged DM can be realized within the clockwork paradigm, without the need to invoke unnaturally small parameters. The model is examined against constraints, theoretical and experimental, and the phenomenologically admissible parameter space is delineated. Several intriguing tests, at the LHC as well as at future direct and indirect detection experiments, are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State with a Smooth Hadron-Quark Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian inference of the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) within a unified framework that incorporates hadronic matter, quark matter, and a smooth hadron--quark crossover. The EOS is constrained using physical consistency filters, gravitational-wave data from GW170817, NICER mass--radius measurements, and hypothetical future high-precision radius data. We find that current observations strongly constrain the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, particularly its slope and curvature, while the highest-density hadronic parameters and quark-matter parameters remain only weakly constrained. The posterior distributions favor a crossover centered at an energy density $\overline{\varepsilon}\sim(4$--$6)\varepsilon_0$ with a width $\Gamma\sim(0.5$--$1.0)\varepsilon_0$, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation. The most probable radius of a canonical neutron star is $R_{1.4}\simeq 11.5-13.0$ km, and the maximum mass is $M_{\rm TOV}\simeq 2.2\,M_\odot$. Overall, present data primarily probe the low-to-intermediate density EOS and provide limited direct sensitivity to quark matter and genuinely high-density physics, highlighting the need for next-generation precision radius measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first extension of the Many-Body Forces (MBF) Model to finite temperature. The MBF Model describes nuclear matter in a relativistic quantum hadrodynamics formalism that takes many-body forces into account through a field dependence of the nuclear interaction coupling constants. Assuming nuclear matter to be charge neutral, beta-equilibrated, and populated by the baryon octet, electrons, and muons, we explore the parameters of the model, three different hyperon coupling schemes (also introduced here for the first time in MBF), and temperature effects to describe basic properties of nuclear matter, including the speed of sound, compressibility, and adiabatic index. We also investigate the mass-radius relation of compact stars by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations at zero and finite temperature, including scenarios with fixed entropy per baryon. Our original results at finite temperature open the path to a new description of proto-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of timelike entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation as a novel probe of the black hole information paradox. By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To construct the high-temperature effective field theory of gauge-Higgs models up to $\mathcal{O}(g^6)$ in the gauge coupling, we integrate out hard modes to three-loop level and use the next-to-next-to-leading order effective potential. For the Abelian Higgs model, we quantify the impact of both higher-dimensional operators and higher-loop corrections on thermodynamic parameters relevant for gravitational-wave observables, finding that one-loop dimension-six effects typically dominate over two- and three-loop corrections to super-renormalizable parameters for the strongest transitions. We derive the three-loop scalar and Debye masses for the ${\rm U(1)}$ and ${\rm SU}(N)$ gauge-Higgs models, as well as the two-loop quartic couplings for the Abelian case, show gauge independence of physical parameters, and demonstrate that no new master integrals are required for the matching, while consistency of 4d and 3d renormalizability points to previously missing contributions in these master integrals.</description>

      <title>Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</description>

      <title>Triple crossing positivity bounds for multi-field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to extract triple crossing symmetric positivity bounds for effective field theories with multiple degrees of freedom, by making use of $su$ symmetric dispersion relations supplemented with positivity of the partial waves, $st$ null constraints and the generalized optical theorem. This generalizes the convex cone approach to constrain the $s^2$ coefficient space to higher orders. Optimal positive bounds can be extracted by semi-definite programs with a continuous decision variable, compared with linear programs for the case of a single field. As an example, we explicitly compute the positivity constraints on bi-scalar theories, and find all the Wilson coefficients can be constrained in a finite region, including the coefficients with odd powers of $s$, which are absent in the single scalar case.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time-Order-Correlators in Holographic EPR pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) for quantum fields in a holographic framework describing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. We compute the four-point and six-point OTOCs using the gravity dual, represented by the string worldsheet theory in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. These correlators quantify the rate at which information is scrambled, leading to the disentanglement of the EPR pair. We demonstrate consistency between two approaches for calculating OTOCs: the holographic influence functional on worldsheets perturbed by shock waves, and the worldsheet scattering in the eikonal approximation. We show that the OTOCs exhibit an initial phase of exponential growth, with six-point correlators indicating a marginally longer scrambling time compared to four-point correlators.</description>

      <title>Physical instabilities and the phase of the Euclidean path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the phase of the Euclidean gravity partition function on manifolds of the form $S^p \times M_q$. We find that the total phase is equal to the phase in pure gravity on $S^p$ times an extra phase that arises from negative mass squared fields that we obtain when we perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction to $S^p$. The latter can be matched to the phase expected for physical negative modes seen by a static path observer in $dS_p$. In the case of $S^p \times S^q$ the answer can be interpreted in terms of a computation in the static patch of $dS_p$ or $dS_q$. We also provide the phase when we have a product of many spheres. We clarify the procedure for determining the precise phase factor. We discuss some aspects of the interpretation of this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we reexamine decoherence effects in quantum field theories with gravity duals. The thought experiment proposed in \cite{DSW_22, DSW_23}, which reveals novel decoherence patterns associated with black holes, also manifests itself from the perspective of the boundary theory. In particular, we consider a moving mirror coupled to quantum critical theories characterized by a dynamical exponent $z$ that are dual to asymptotically Lifshitz geometries. The interference experiment occurs on the boundary, where a superposition of two spatially separated quantum states of a mirror is maintained for a finite time $\tau_0$ before recombination. We find that the interaction with a quantum field at finite temperature, arising from the presence of a Lifshitz black hole, leads to a constant decoherence rate. In contrast, for the zero-temperature case corresponding to pure Lifshitz spacetime, the decoherence rate vanishes in the large-time limit $\tau_0 \to \infty$. Remarkably, in the zero-temperature regime, the decoherence exhibits a power-law decay at large $\tau_0$ as $z \rightarrow \infty$, a behavior reminiscent of the decoherence patterns seen in extremal black hole geometries. In addition, we investigate the decoherence of one particle in an EPR pair constructed holographically. Our results indicate that causality plays a crucial role in determining whether the entanglement leads to the suppression of decoherence in the other particle.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

Abstract: We embed the perturbative Fock state of the Yang-Mills BV-multiplet in the vertex operator algebra of the path-integral for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric world line and evaluate the pull-back of the latter to an integral form on supermoduli space. Choosing a suitable Poincar\'e dual on the latter, we show that this integral form describes an extension of Yang-Mills theory. Upon projection back to the Fock space, we recover the Yang-Mills action from the world line. This furthermore gives an a priori justification for the construction of Yang-Mills equations of motion as emerging from deformations of the BRST differential.</description>

      <title>Baryons, Skyrmions and $\theta$-periodicity anomaly in chiral and vector-like gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the baryons and solitons of chiral and vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories with matter in mixed one and two-index representations. Focusing on the Color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, we compute the topology of the coset of their low-energy EFT. We find that in the chiral models under consideration, Skyrmions are always absent. We also show, however, that some of these models admit heavy baryons that are expected to be stable, because their decay into the lighter degrees of freedom of the EFT is forbidden by the unbroken symmetry group. This mismatch suggests that some deeper dynamical mechanism must be responsible with either the instability of the seemingly stable heavy baryons or the unreliability of the Skyrme model in the low-energy EFT. In the vector-like models all the expected baryons are mirrored by Skyrmions. Then we turn to the study of domain walls. We determine some aspects of their dynamics by matching the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly. We find that, for complete CFL, the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly is always matched without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom in the low-energy EFT. If part of the color group is unbroken, new dynamical degrees of freedom must be added to the low-energy EFT in the domain-wall background with few exceptions.</description>

Abstract: The one-loop gravitational path integral around Euclidean de Sitter space $S^D$ has a complex phase that casts doubt on a state counting interpretation. Recently, it was proposed to cancel this phase by including an observer. We explore this proposal in the case where the observer is a charged black hole in equilibrium with the de Sitter horizon. We compute the phase of the one-loop determinant within a two-dimensional dilaton gravity reduction, using both numerical and analytical methods. Our results interpolate between previous studies of a probe geodesic observer and the Nariai solution. We also revisit the prescription for going from the Euclidean path integral to the state-counting partition function, finding a positive sign in the final density of states.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic analysis for the metric of a generic solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory is provided by solving the field equations in the Fefferman-Graham frame. Using standard holographic renormalization, the counterterms that render the action finite are found up to seven spacetime dimensions. In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model in the near-extremal black brane background with quantum corrections in the near-horizon. The near-horizon geometry is described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and the quantum fluctuations are governed by the Schwarzian action. We introduce the Schwarzian modes into the RS metric, derive the quantum-corrected equation for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes via the Schwinger-Dyson equation, calculate the correction to the KK mass spectrum, and discuss the impact of quantum corrections on the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our work introduces both quantum corrections and temperature into the RS model, providing insights into cosmology and phase transitions within it.</description>

      <title>Diamonds in the Bulk and Large-$N$ Scaling in AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a quantum field of arbitrary mass and spin in the static patch of de Sitter spacetime, the Euclidean partition function receives contributions from edge modes localized on the horizon, expressible in terms of the Harish-Chandra character of the de Sitter group. Considering the flat limit and summing over all string fields, we obtain the partition function of edge modes in string theory near the Minkowski-Rindler horizon. Application of the Kronecker limit formula naturally yields a modular invariant one-loop partition function. The resulting expression generalizes the edge contribution of a massive vector boson in a spontaneously broken gauge theory to the infinite tower in string theory. It is naturally ultraviolet finite and amenable to a state-counting interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement characterizing topological phase transitions in holographic nodal line semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral has proven remarkably effective in the quantum regime of black hole physics. In this work, we examine the applicability of the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion for admissible complex metrics in the context of the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral. We find that, for the super-conformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with unequal angular momenta, the black hole saddle points violate the KSW criterion precisely where the statistical description of the index breaks down. The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>The heterotic G$_2$ system with reducible characteristic holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the heterotic G$_2$ system on almost contact metric manifolds with reduced characteristic holonomy. We focus on $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds and $(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, the latter being a convenient reformulation of spin $\eta$-Einstein $\alpha$-Sasaki manifolds. Investigating a $1$-parameter family of G$_2$-connections on the tangent bundle, we obtain several approximate solutions as well as one new class of exact solutions on degenerate $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is a "2-graph" $\Gamma^2$ embedded in a 3d Cauchy slice $\Sigma$, which has equipped the structure of a discrete 2-groupoid. Upon such 2-graphs, we model the extended Wilson surface operators in 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's {\it measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows these 2-graph operators -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matrix gives it a categorical quasitriangularity structure, which we call the {\it cobraiding}. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group 2-gauge theories on the lattice. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables from it.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^r$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, we actually prove such singularity germ is the cone vertex over a contact orbifold with weak K\"ahler-Einstein metric, forcing $r=1$. In particular, it admits a (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, which also extends to (canonical) actions of $\mathbb{H}^*\supset SU(2)$. These settle Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form by establishing the canonicity, the extensibility of the action, for instance. Our key idea is to use the Donaldson-Sun theory on local K\"ahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertions, assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)K\"ahler metrics. Conversely, our results can also be used to study the local behavior of such metrics around the germ.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lam\'{e} coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quasinormal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift terms. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Theory space and stability analysis of General Relativistic cosmological solutions in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0&lt;|\varepsilon|&lt;1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)&lt;0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the center of momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole--antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, demonstrating the applicability of the thin-defect approximation throughout the phenomenologically favoured region and without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a numerically stable and flexible framework for implementing open-system effects in inflationary perturbations, rather than the extraction of concrete predictions for the primordial spectrum. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

Abstract: Recently, references [1,2] found that the repetitive Penrose process cannot extract all the extractable rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and reference [3] found that the repetitive electric Penrose process cannot extract all the electrical energy of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.</description>

      <title>Higher curvature corrections to the black hole Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the annihilation to nothing scenario</title>

Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation incorporating higher-curvature corrections. We show that, once these corrections are taken into account, the WDW wave function exhibits severe divergences arising from contributions near the classical singularity. These divergences indicate that the low-energy effective field theory (EFT) description breaks down in this regime.
  Given that general relativity (GR) itself is merely a low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, our results suggest that any attempted resolution of the black hole singularity cannot be reliably discussed within the EFT framework. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture, but emphasizes that the annihilation-to-nothing scenario should be discussed within a UV-complete theoretical framework. It further clarifies that any genuine resolution of the singularity necessarily requires a framework capable of appropriately describing ultraviolet physics, such as degrees of freedom beyond those captured by GR or dynamics consistently defined up to arbitrarily high energy scales.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose Process in Accelerating Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01414</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates the repetitive Penrose process in accelerating Kerr black holes and explores the influence of the acceleration factor on the repetitive Penrose process. After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.</description>
