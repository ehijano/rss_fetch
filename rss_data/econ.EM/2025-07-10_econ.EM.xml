      <title>Identifying Present-Biased Discount Functions in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the identification of dynamic discrete choice models with sophisticated, quasi-hyperbolic time preferences under exclusion restrictions. We consider both standard finite horizon problems and empirically useful infinite horizon ones, which we prove to always have solutions. We reduce identification to finding the present-bias and standard discount factors that solve a system of polynomial equations with coefficients determined by the data and use this to bound the cardinality of the identified set. The discount factors are usually identified, but hard to precisely estimate, because exclusion restrictions do not capture the defining feature of present bias, preference reversals, well.</description>

      <title>Tracking the economy at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a high-frequency economic indicator using a Bayesian Dynamic Factor Model estimated with mixed-frequency data. The model incorporates weekly, monthly, and quarterly official indicators, and allows for dynamic heterogeneity and stochastic volatility. To ensure temporal consistency and avoid irregular aggregation artifacts, we introduce a pseudo-week structure that harmonizes the timing of observations. Our framework integrates dispersed and asynchronous official statistics into a unified High-Frequency Economic Index (HFEI), enabling real-time economic monitoring even in environments characterized by severe data limitations. We apply this framework to construct a high-frequency indicator for Ecuador, a country where official data are sparse and highly asynchronous, and compute pseudo-weekly recession probabilities using a time-varying mean regime-switching model fitted to the resulting index.</description>

      <title>Debiased Semiparametric Efficient Changes-in-Changes Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel extension of the influential changes-in-changes (CiC) framework [Athey and Imbens, 2006] to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and distributional causal estimands in panel data settings with unmeasured confounding. While CiC relaxes the parallel trends assumption inherent in difference-in-differences (DiD), existing approaches typically accommodate only a single scalar unobserved confounder and rely on monotonicity assumptions between the confounder and the outcome. Moreover, current formulations lack inference procedures and theoretical guarantees that accommodate continuous covariates. Motivated by the intricate nature of confounding in empirical applications and the need to incorporate continuous covariates in a principled manner, we make two key contributions in this technical report. First, we establish nonparametric identification under a novel set of assumptions that permit high-dimensional unmeasured confounders and non-monotonic relationships between confounders and outcomes. Second, we construct efficient estimators that are Neyman orthogonal to infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, facilitating valid inference even in the presence of high-dimensional continuous or discrete covariates and flexible machine learning-based nuisance estimation.</description>

      <title>Galerkin-ARIMA: A Two-Stage Polynomial Regression Framework for Fast Rolling One-Step-Ahead Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Estimation of Distributional Treatment Effects with Multi-Task Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically, precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Convexity Not Required: Estimation of Smooth Moment Condition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized and Simulated Method of Moments are often used to estimate structural Economic models. Yet, it is commonly reported that optimization is challenging because the corresponding objective function is non-convex. For smooth problems, this paper shows that convexity is not required: under conditions involving the Jacobian of the moments, certain algorithms are globally convergent. These include a gradient-descent and a Gauss-Newton algorithm with appropriate choice of tuning parameters. The results are robust to 1) non-convexity, 2) one-to-one moderately non-linear reparameterizations, and 3) moderate misspecification. The conditions preclude non-global optima. Numerical and empirical examples illustrate the condition, non-convexity, and convergence properties of different optimizers.</description>

      <title>Inference for Rank-Rank Regressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slope coefficient in a rank-rank regression is a popular measure of intergenerational mobility. In this article, we first show that commonly used inference methods for this slope parameter are invalid. Second, when the underlying distribution is not continuous, the OLS estimator and its asymptotic distribution may be highly sensitive to how ties in the ranks are handled. Motivated by these findings we develop a new asymptotic theory for the OLS estimator in a general class of rank-rank regression specifications without imposing any assumptions about the continuity of the underlying distribution. We then extend the asymptotic theory to other regressions involving ranks that have been used in empirical work. Finally, we apply our new inference methods to two empirical studies on intergenerational mobility, highlighting the practical implications of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy for Factor-Augmented Regressions with Weaker Loadings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the theoretical foundation for the recent tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing by Pitarakis (2023) and Pitarakis (2025), when the competing forecast specification is that of a factor-augmented regression model. This should be of interest for practitioners, as there is no theory justifying the use of these simple and powerful tests in such context. In pursuit of this, we employ a novel theory to incorporate the empirically well-documented fact of homogeneously/heterogeneously weak factor loadings, and track their effect on the forecast comparison problem.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for selecting policies that maximize expected welfare under estimation uncertainty. The proposed method explicitly balances the size of the estimated welfare against the uncertainty inherent in its estimation, ensuring that chosen policies meet a reporting guarantee, namely, that actual welfare is guaranteed not to fall below the reported estimate with a pre-specified confidence level. We produce the efficient decision frontier, describing policies that offer maximum estimated welfare for a given acceptable level of estimation risk. We apply this approach to a variety of settings, including the selection of policy rules that allocate individuals to treatments and the allocation of limited budgets among competing social programs.</description>

      <title>Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple Differences (DDD) designs are widely used in empirical work to relax parallel trends assumptions in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) settings. This paper highlights that common DDD implementations -- such as taking the difference between two DiDs or applying three-way fixed effects regressions -- are generally invalid when identification requires conditioning on covariates. In staggered adoption settings, the common DiD practice of pooling all not-yet-treated units as a comparison group can introduce additional bias, even when covariates are not required for identification. These insights challenge conventional empirical strategies and underscore the need for estimators tailored specifically to DDD structures. We develop regression adjustment, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators that remain valid under covariate-adjusted DDD parallel trends. For staggered designs, we demonstrate how to effectively utilize multiple comparison groups to obtain more informative inferences. Simulations and three empirical applications highlight bias reductions and precision gains relative to standard approaches, offering a new framework for DDD estimation in empirical research. A companion R package is available.</description>

      <title>It's Hard to Be Normal: The Impact of Noise on Structure-agnostic Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.</description>
