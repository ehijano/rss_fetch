      <description>arXiv:2501.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral data-enabled control approaches typically assume data-generating systems of linear dynamics. This may result in false generalization if the newly designed closed-loop system results in input-output distributional shifts beyond learning data. These shifts may compromise safety by activating harmful nonlinearities in the data-generating system not experienced previously in the data and/or not captured by the linearity assumption inherent in these approaches. This paper proposes an approach to slow down the distributional shifts and therefore enhance the safety of the data-enabled methods. This is achieved by introducing quadratic regularization terms to the data-enabled predictive control formulations. Slowing down the distributional shifts comes at the expense of slowing down the exploration, in a trade-off resembling the exploration vs exploitation balance in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Capacity Expansion Planning under Uncertainty subject to Expected Energy Not Served Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for solving a large-scale stochastic capacity expansion problem which explicitly considers reliability constraints, in particular constraints on expected energy not served. Our method tackles this problem by a Lagrange relaxation of the expected energy not served constraints. We solve the relaxed formulation in an iterative manner, using a subgradient-based method. Each iteration requires the solution of a stochastic capacity expansion problem, for which we implement a subgradient decomposition scheme in a high-performance computing infrastructure. We apply the proposed methodology on the Economic Viability Assessment model that is used by ENTSO-E in the annual European Resource Adequacy Assessment, extended to include explicit reliability constraints. The approach is able to solve this model achieving a 1.3% optimality gap. We compare our approach against accounting for reliability through penalizing load shedding at VOLL, and find that the former results in 1.6% savings in total cost. We are also able to quantify the cost savings from allowing some load curtailment in the capacity planning process, which ranges from 1.6 to 6% in the cases analyzed.</description>

      <title>A Sampling Complexity-aware Framework for Discrete-time Fractional-Order Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of complex biological, natural and man-made systems exhibit non-Markovian dynamics that can be modeled through fractional order differential equations, yet, we lack sample comlexity aware system identification strategies. Towards this end, we propose an affine discrete-time fractional order dynamical system (FoDS) identification algorithm and provide a detailed sample complexity analysis. The algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of FoDS identification in the presence of noisy data. The proposed algorithm consists of two key steps. Firstly, it avoids solving higher-order polynomial equations, which would otherwise result in multiple potential solutions for the fractional orders. Secondly, the identification problem is reformulated as a least squares estimation, allowing us to infer the system parameters. We derive the expectation and probabilistic bounds for the FoDS parameter estimation error, assuming prior knowledge of the functions \( f \) and \( g \) in the FoDS model. The error decays at a rate of \( N = O\left( \frac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \), where \( N \) is the number of samples, \( d \) is the dimension of the state variable, and \( \epsilon \) represents the desired estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that our theoretical bounds are tight, validating the accuracy and robustness of this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Accelerated DC loadflow solver for topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel solver that accelerates DC loadflow computations for power grid topology optimization tasks. Our approach leverages low-rank updates of the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) to represent substation splits, line outages, and reconfigurations without ever refactorizing the system. Furthermore, we implement the core routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), thereby exploiting their high-throughput architecture for linear algebra. A two-level decomposition separates changes in branch topology from changes in nodal injections, enabling additional speed-ups by an in-the-loop brute force search over injection variations at minimal additional cost. We demonstrate billion-loadflow-per-second performance on power grids of varying sizes in workload settings which are typical for gradient-free topology optimization such as Reinforcement Learning or Quality Diversity methods. While adopting the DC approximation sacrifices some accuracy and prohibits the computation of voltage magnitudes, we show that this sacrifice unlocks new scales of computational feasibility, offering a powerful tool for large-scale grid planning and operational topology optimization.</description>

      <title>Pole-Zero Identification: Unveiling the Critical Dynamics of Microwave Circuits Beyond Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pole-zero identification refers to the obtaining of the poles and zeros of a linear (or linearized) system described by its frequency response. This is usually done using optimization techniques (such as least squares, maximum likelihood estimation, or vector fitting) that fit a given frequency response of the linear system to a transfer function defined as the ratio of two polynomials. This kind of linear system identification in the frequency domain has numerous applications in a wide variety of engineering fields (such as mechanical systems, power systems and Electromagnetic Compatibility). In the microwave domain, rational approximation is increasingly used to obtain black-box models of complex passive structures for model order reduction and efficient transient simulation. In this paper we will focus on a different application of pole-zero identification. We will review the different ways in which pole-zero identification can be applied to nonlinear circuit design (for power amplifier stability analysis and beyond). We will give a comprehensive view on recent approaches through illustrative application examples. Other uses of rational approximation techniques are beyond the scope of this paper.</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of Stabilization Parameters in RF Power Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for the calculation of the stabilization parameters in RF power amplifiers operating in periodic large-signal regimes. Stabilization is achieved by applying the principles of linear control theory for Periodic Linear Time-Varying (PLTV) systems. A numerical method is proposed to obtain the Harmonic Transfer Function that represents the system linearized around the large-signal steady state. Then, a feedback analysis is performed to calculate the closed-loop poles of the PLTV system. The proposed approach is demonstrated with two examples. Firstly, a three-stage amplifier that exhibits a low-frequency oscillation for increasing values of input power is correctly stabilized. Next, the stabilization of an unstable design that exhibits an odd-mode parametric oscillation is presented. The results of the proposed technique are compared to those obtained with the conventional parametric stability simulation. These examples serve to illustrate the capability and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Coalitional model predictive control of an irrigation canal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical control scheme for large-scale systems whose components can exchange information through a data network. The main goal of the supervisory layer is to find the best compromise between control performance and communicational costs by actively modifying the network topology. The actions taken at the supervisory layer alter the control agents' knowledge of the complete system, and the set of agents with which they can communicate. Each group of linked subsystems, or coalition, is independently controlled based on a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme, managed at the bottom layer. Hard constraints on the inputs are imposed, while soft constraints on the states are considered to avoid feasibility issues. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated on a model of the Dez irrigation canal, implemented on the accurate simulator for water systems SOBEK. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained using a centralized MPC controller.</description>

      <title>Coalitional Control: Cooperative game theory and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of information and communication technologies has yielded the means of sharing measurements and other information in an efficient and flexible way, which has enabled the size and complexity of control applications to increase. At the same time, the improvements in the computational and communicational capabilities of control devices have fostered the development of noncentralized control architectures, already motivated by the inherent structural constraints of large-scale systems. Computer-based control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) are visible beneficiaries of these advances and have registered a significant growth regarding both theoretical and applied fields. Coalitional control focuses on the local interests that motivate the controllers to assemble, an aspect so far rarely contemplated in the distributed control literature. This article presents the main concepts and challenges in coalitional control, and the links with cooperative network game theory.</description>

      <title>Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Prosumer District Heating Networks: The Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an economic nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for district heating networks (DHNs). The proposed method features prosumers, multiple producers, and storage systems, which are essential components of 4th generation DHNs. These networks are characterized by their ability to optimize their operations, aiming to reduce supply temperatures, accommodate distributed heat sources, and leverage the flexibility provided by thermal inertia and storage, all crucial for achieving a fossil-fuel-free energy supply. Developing a smart energy management system to accomplish these goals requires detailed models of highly complex nonlinear systems and computational algorithms able to handle large-scale optimization problems. To address this, we introduce a graph-based optimization-oriented model that efficiently integrates distributed producers, prosumers, storage buffers, and bidirectional pipe flows, such that it can be implemented in a real-time MPC setting. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in closed-loop. Our findings demonstrate that the MPC methods achieved up to 9% cost improvement over traditional rule-based controllers while better maintaining system constraints.</description>

      <title>Coalitional control: a bottom-up approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent major developments in information technologies have opened interesting possibilities for the effective management of multi-agent systems. In many cases, the important role of central control nodes can now be undertaken by several controllers in a distributed topology that suits better the structure of the system. This opens as well the possibility to promote cooperation between control agents in competitive environments, establishing links between controllers in order to adapt the exchange of critical information to the degree of subsystems' interactions. In this paper a bottom-up approach to coalitional control is presented, where the structure of each agent's model predictive controller is adapted to the time-variant coupling conditions, promoting the formation of coalitions - clusters of control agents where communication is essential to ensure the cooperation - whenever it can bring benefit to the overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Power System Dynamics: Improving Simulation Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance and cost of time-domain simulations when studying power systems have exponentially increased in the last decades. With the growing share of renewable energy sources, the slow and predictable responses from large turbines are replaced by the fast and unpredictable dynamics from power electronics. The current existing simulation tools require new solutions designed for faster dynamics. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged in power systems to accelerate such simulations. By incorporating knowledge during the up-front training, PINNs provide more accurate results over larger time steps than traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces PINNs as an alternative approximation method that seamlessly integrates with the current simulation framework. We replace a synchronous machine for a trained PINN in the IEEE 9-, 14-, and 30-bus systems and simulate several network disturbances. Including PINNs systematically boosts the simulations' accuracy, providing more accurate results for both the PINN-modeled component and the whole multi-machine system states.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Control of Perturbed Density Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates dynamical systems for which the derivative of some positive-definite function along the solutions of this system depends on so-called density function. In turn, such dynamical systems are called density systems. The density function sets the density of the space, where the system is evolved, and affects the behaviour of the original system. For example, this function can define (un)stable regions and forbidden regions where there are no system solutions. The density function can be used in the design of new adaptive control laws with the formulation of appropriate new control goals, e.g., stabilization in given bounded or semi-bounded sets. To design a novel adaptive control law that ensures the system outputs in a given set, systems with known and unknown parameters under disturbances are considered. All theoretical results and conclusions are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using Normal Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of realizing rotary propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using forces purely normal to the stick is considered. This problem represents a nonprehensile manipulation task of an underactuated system. In contrast with previous approaches, the devil-stick is manipulated by controlling the normal force and its point of application. Virtual holonomic constraints are used to design the trajectory of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation angle, and conditions for stable propeller motion are derived. Intermittent large-amplitude forces are used to asymptotically stabilize a desired propeller motion. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in realizing stable propeller motion without loss of contact between the actuator and devil-stick.</description>

      <title>Recyclable Thin-Film Soft Electronics for Smart Packaging and E-Skins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in soft, sticker_like electronics, few efforts have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing an eco friendly conductive ink for thin_film circuitry composed of silver flakes and a water_based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical conductivity (1.6 x 105 S m_1), high resolution digital printability, robust adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability. Recycling is achieved with an ecologically friendly processing method to decompose the circuits into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only 2.4 per cent in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up to 200 per cent strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps. Finally, on_skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable foods are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Replacing the Gallium Oxide Shell with Conductive Ag: Toward a Printable and Recyclable Composite for Highly Stretchable Electronics, Electromagnetic Shielding, and Thermal Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid metal (LM)-based composites hold promise for soft electronics due to their high conductivity and fluidic nature. However, the presence of {\alpha}_Ga2O3 and GaOOH layers around LM droplets impairs conductivity and performance. We tackle this issue by replacing the oxide layer with conductive silver (Ag) using an ultrasonic_assisted galvanic replacement reaction. The Ag_coated nanoparticles form aggregated, porous microparticles that are mixed with styrene_isoprene_styrene (SIS) polymers, resulting in a digitally printable composite with superior electrical conductivity and electromechanical properties compared to conventional fillers. Adding more LM enhances these properties further. The composite achieves EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) exceeding 75 dB in the X_band frequency range, even at 200 per cent strain, meeting stringent military and medical standards. It is applicable in wireless communications and Bluetooth signal blocking and as a thermal interface material (TIM). Additionally, we highlight its recyclability using a biodegradable solvent, underscoring its eco_friendly potential. This composite represents a significant advancement in stretchable electronics and EMI shielding, with implications for wearable and bioelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Data-Driven Algorithm for Continuous-Time Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presented is an algorithm to synthesize an infinite-horizon LQR optimal feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics, but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of (possibly suboptimal) input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along an arbitrary trajectory. This paper presents the derivation as well as shows examples applied to both linear and nonlinear systems inspired by air vehicles.</description>

      <title>Remote State Estimation over a Wearing Channel: Information Freshness vs. Channel Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the remote estimation of a linear Gaussian system over a nonstationary channel that wears out over time and with every use. The sensor can either transmit a fresh measurement in the current time slot, restore the channel quality at the cost of downtime, or remain silent. More frequent transmissions yield accurate estimates but incur significant wear on the channel. Renewing the channel too often improves channel conditions but results in poor estimation quality. What is the optimal timing to transmit measurements and restore the channel? We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and show the monotonicity properties of an optimal policy. A structured policy iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal policy.</description>

      <title>SemML: Enhancing Automata-Theoretic LTL Synthesis with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing a reactive system from specifications given in linear temporal logic (LTL) is a classical problem, finding its applications in safety-critical systems design. We present our tool SemML, which won this year's LTL realizability tracks of SYNTCOMP, after years of domination by Strix. While both tools are based on the automata-theoretic approach, ours relies heavily on (i) Semantic labelling, additional information of logical nature, coming from recent LTL-to-automata translations and decorating the resulting parity game, and (ii) Machine Learning approaches turning this information into a guidance oracle for on-the-fly exploration of the parity game (whence the name SemML). Our tool fills the missing gaps of previous suggestions to use such an oracle and provides an efficeint implementation with additional algorithmic improvements. We evaluate SemML both on the entire set of SYNTCOMP as well as a synthetic data set, compare it to Strix, and analyze the advantages and limitations. As SemML solves more instances on SYNTCOMP and does so significantly faster on larger instances, this demonstrates for the first time that machine-learning-aided approaches can out-perform state-of-the-art tools in real LTL synthesis.</description>

      <title>Inferring Implicit Goals Across Differing Task Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the significant challenges to generating value-aligned behavior is to not only account for the specified user objectives but also any implicit or unspecified user requirements. The existence of such implicit requirements could be particularly common in settings where the user's understanding of the task model may differ from the agent's estimate of the model. Under this scenario, the user may incorrectly expect some agent behavior to be inevitable or guaranteed. This paper addresses such expectation mismatch in the presence of differing models by capturing the possibility of unspecified user subgoal in the context of a task captured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and querying for it as required. Our method identifies bottleneck states and uses them as candidates for potential implicit subgoals. We then introduce a querying strategy that will generate the minimal number of queries required to identify a policy guaranteed to achieve the underlying goal. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in inferring and achieving unstated goals across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the navigation of magnetic microrobots through cerebral bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local administration of thrombolytics in ischemic stroke could accelerate clot lysis and the ensuing reperfusion while minimizing the side effects of systemic administration. Medical microrobots could be injected into the bloodstream and magnetically navigated to the clot for administering the drugs directly to the target. The magnetic manipulation required to navigate medical microrobots will depend on various parameters such as the microrobots size, the blood velocity, and the imposed magnetic field gradients. Numerical simulation was used to study the motion of magnetically controlled microrobots flowing through representative cerebral bifurcations, for predicting the magnetic gradients required to navigate the microrobots from the injection point until the target location. Upon thorough validation of the model against several independent analytical and experimental results, the model was used to generate maps and a predictive equation providing quantitative information on the required magnetic gradients, for different scenarios. The developed maps and predictive equation are crucial to inform the design, operation and optimization of magnetic navigation systems for healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>SafePR: Unified Approach for Safe Parallel Robots by Contact Detection and Reaction with Redundancy Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and self-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.</description>

      <title>Solve the General Constrained Optimal Control Problem with Common Integration Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.02140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation of general state- and/or control-constrained Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) is difficult for various constraints, especially the intractable path constraint. For such problems, the theoretical convergence of numerical algorithms is usually not guaranteed, and the right solution may not be successfully obtained. With the recently proposed Variation Evolving Method (VEM), the evolution equations, which guarantee the convergence towards the optimal solution in theory even for the general constrained OCPs, are derived. In particular, the costate-free optimality conditions are established. Besides the analytic expressions of the costates and the Lagrange multipliers adjoining the terminal constraint, the integral equation that determines the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multiplier variable is also derived. Upon the work in this paper, the general constrained OCPs may be transformed to the Initial-value Problems (IVPs) to be solved, with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical integration methods.</description>

Abstract: A stochastic Model Predictive Control strategy for control systems with communication networks between the sensor node and the controller and between the controller and the actuator node is proposed. Data packets are subject to random delays and packet loss is possible; acknowledgments for received packets are not provided.
  The expected value of a quadratic cost is minimized subject to linear constraints; the set of all initial states for which the resulting optimization problem is guaranteed to be feasible is provided.

      <title>Leader-Follower Density Control of Spatial Dynamics in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a leaders' density feedback. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Deep Neural Network-Based Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety constraints of nonlinear control systems are commonly enforced through the use of control barrier functions (CBFs). Uncertainties in the dynamic model can disrupt forward invariance guarantees or cause the state to be restricted to an overly conservative subset of the safe set. In this paper, adaptive deep neural networks (DNNs) are combined with CBFs to produce a family of controllers that ensure safety while learning the system's dynamics in real-time without the requirement for pre-training. By basing the least squares adaptation law on a state derivative estimator-based identification error, the DNN parameter estimation error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The convergent bound on the parameter estimation error is then used to formulate CBF-constraints in an optimization-based controller to guarantee safety despite model uncertainty. Furthermore, the developed method is extended for use under intermittent loss of state-feedback. A switched systems analysis for CBFs is provided with a maximum dwell-time condition during which the feedback can be unavailable. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the ability of the developed method to ensure safety in an adaptive cruise control problem and when feedback is lost, unlike baseline methods. Results show improved performance compared to baseline methods and demonstrate the ability of the developed method to ensure safety in feedback-denied environments.</description>

      <title>A large synthetic dataset for machine learning applications in power transmission grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the ongoing energy transition, power grids are evolving fast. They operate more and more often close to their technical limit, under more and more volatile conditions. Fast, essentially real-time computational approaches to evaluate their operational safety, stability and reliability are therefore highly desirable. Machine Learning methods have been advocated to solve this challenge, however they are heavy consumers of training and testing data, while historical operational data for real-world power grids are hard if not impossible to access. This manuscript presents a large synthetic dataset of power injections in an electric transmission grid model of continental Europe, and describes the algorithm developed for its generation. The method allows one to generate arbitrarily large time series from the knowledge of the grid -- the admittance of its lines as well as the location, type and capacity of its power generators -- and aggregated power consumption data, such as the national load data given by ENTSO-E. The obtained datasets are statistically validated against real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and embedded devices in the past decade has introduced numerous challenges in terms of security and configuration management. Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.</description>

      <title>A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lead Time on Aggregate EV Flexibility for Congestion Management Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increased electrification of energy end-usage can lead to network congestion during periods of high consumption. Flexibility of loads, such as aggregate smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs), is increasingly leveraged to manage grid congestion through various market-based mechanisms. Under such an arrangement, this paper quantifies the effect of lead time on the aggregate flexibility of EV fleets. Simulations using real-world charging transactions spanning over different categories of charging stations are performed for two flexibility products (redispatch and capacity limitations) when offered along with different business-as-usual (BAU) schedules. Results show that the variation of tradable flexibility depends mainly on the BAU schedules, the duration of the requested flexibility, and its start time. Further, the implication of these flexibility products on the average energy costs and emissions is also studied for different cases. Simulations show that bidirectional (V2G) charging outperforms unidirectional smart charging in all cases.</description>

Abstract: Living organisms interact with their surroundings in a closed-loop fashion, where sensory inputs dictate the initiation and termination of behaviours. Even simple animals are able to develop and execute complex plans, which has not yet been replicated in robotics using pure closed-loop input control. We propose a solution to this problem by defining a set of discrete and temporary closed-loop controllers, called ``Tasks'', each representing a closed-loop behaviour. We further introduce a supervisory module which has an innate understanding of physics and causality, through which it can simulate the execution of Task sequences over time and store the results in a model of the environment. On the basis of this model, plans can be made by chaining temporary closed-loop controllers. Our proposed framework was implemented for a real robot and tested in two scenarios as proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>

Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified man-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>
