      <title>Low-Rank Structured Nonparametric Prediction of Instantaneous Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on It\^o semimartingale models, several studies have proposed methods for forecasting intraday volatility using high-frequency financial data. These approaches typically rely on restrictive parametric assumptions and are often vulnerable to model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce a novel nonparametric prediction method for the future intraday instantaneous volatility process during trading hours, which leverages both previous days' data and the current day's observed intraday data. Our approach imposes an interday-by-intraday matrix representation of the instantaneous volatility, which is decomposed into a low-rank conditional expectation component and a noise matrix. To predict the future conditional expected volatility vector, we exploit this low-rank structure and propose the Structural Intraday-volatility Prediction (SIP) procedure. We establish the asymptotic properties of the SIP estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through an out-of-sample prediction study using real high-frequency trading data.</description>

      <title>Testing for multiple change-points in macroeconometrics: an empirical guide and recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments in detecting and estimating multiple change-points in time series models with exogenous and endogenous regressors, panel data models, and factor models. This review differs from others in multiple ways: (1) it focuses on inference about the change-points in slope parameters, rather than in the mean of the dependent variable - the latter being common in the statistical literature; (2) it focuses on detecting - via sequential testing and other methods - multiple change-points, and only discusses one change-point when methods for multiple change-points are not available; (3) it is meant as a practitioner's guide for empirical macroeconomists first, and as a result, it focuses only on the methods derived under the most general assumptions relevant to macroeconomic applications.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction for Conditional Density Estimation with Applications to High-Dimensional Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and computationally efficient approach for nonparametric conditional density estimation in high-dimensional settings that achieves dimension reduction without imposing restrictive distributional or functional form assumptions. To uncover the underlying sparsity structure of the data, we develop an innovative conditional dependence measure and a modified cross-validation procedure that enables data-driven variable selection, thereby circumventing the need for subjective threshold selection. We demonstrate the practical utility of our dimension-reduced conditional density estimation by applying it to doubly robust estimators for average treatment effects. Notably, our proposed procedure is able to select relevant variables for nonparametric propensity score estimation and also inherently reduce the dimensionality of outcome regressions through a refined ignorability condition. We evaluate the finite-sample properties of our approach through comprehensive simulation studies and an empirical study on the effects of 401(k) eligibility on savings using SIPP data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many causal and structural parameters in economics can be identified and estimated by computing the value of an optimization program over all distributions consistent with the model and the data. Existing tools apply when the data is discrete, or when only disjoint marginals of the distribution are identified, which is restrictive in many applications. We develop a general framework that yields sharp bounds on a linear functional of the unknown true distribution under i) an arbitrary collection of identified joint subdistributions and ii) structural conditions, such as (conditional) independence. We encode the identification restrictions as a continuous collection of moments of characteristic kernels, and use duality and approximation theory to rewrite the infinite-dimensional program over Borel measures as a finite-dimensional program that is simple to compute. Our approach yields a consistent estimator that is $\sqrt{n}$-uniformly valid for the sharp bounds. In the special case of empirical optimal transport with Lipschitz cost, where the minimax rate is $n^{2/d}$, our method yields a uniformly consistent estimator with an asymmetric rate, converging at $\sqrt{n}$ uniformly from one side.</description>

      <title>Inference on Common Trends in a Cointegrated Nonlinear SVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of performing inference on the number of common stochastic trends when data is generated by a cointegrated CKSVAR (a two-regime, piecewise-linear SVAR; Mavroeidis, 2021), using a modified version of the Breitung (2002) multivariate variance ratio test that is robust to the presence of nonlinear cointegration (of a known form). To derive the asymptotics of our test statistic, we prove a fundamental LLN-type result for a class of stable but nonstationary autoregressive processes, using a novel dual linear process approximation. We show that our modified test yields correct inferences regarding the number of common trends in such a system, whereas the unmodified test tends to infer a higher number of common trends than are actually present, when cointegrating relations are nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Heterogeneous Distribution Regression Panel Models, with an Application to Labor Income Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic distribution regression panel data model with heterogeneous coefficients across units. The objects of primary interest are functionals of these coefficients, including predicted one-step-ahead and stationary cross-sectional distributions of the outcome variable. Coefficients and their functionals are estimated via fixed effect methods. We investigate how these functionals vary in response to counterfactual changes in initial conditions or covariate values. We also identify a uniformity problem related to the robustness of inference to the unknown degree of coefficient heterogeneity, and propose a cross-sectional bootstrap method for uniformly valid inference on function-valued objects. We showcase the utility of our approach through an empirical application to individual income dynamics. Employing the annual Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, we establish the presence of substantial coefficient heterogeneity. We then highlight some important empirical questions that our methodology can address. First, we quantify the impact of a negative labor income shock on the distribution of future labor income.</description>

      <title>Clustered Covariate Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High covariate dimensionality is increasingly occurrent in model estimation, and existing techniques to address this issue typically require sparsity or discrete heterogeneity of the \emph{unobservable} parameter vector. However, neither restriction may be supported by economic theory in some empirical contexts, leading to severe bias and misleading inference. The clustering-based grouped parameter estimator (GPE) introduced in this paper drops both restrictions and maintains the natural one that the parameter support be bounded. GPE exhibits robust large sample properties under standard conditions and accommodates both sparse and non-sparse parameters whose support can be bounded away from zero. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the excellent performance of GPE in terms of bias reduction and size control compared to competing estimators. An empirical application of GPE to estimating price and income elasticities of demand for gasoline highlights its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Potential Outcome Modeling and Estimation in DiD Designs with Staggered Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first potential outcome modeling of Difference-in-Differences designs with multiple time periods and variation in treatment timing. Importantly, the modeling respects the two key identifying assumptions: parallel trends and noanticipation. We then introduce a straightforward Bayesian approach for estimation and inference of the time-varying group specific Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT). To improve parsimony and guide prior elicitation, we reparametrize the model in a way that reduces the effective number of parameters. Prior information about the ATT's is incorporated through black-box training sample priors and, in small-sample settings, by thick-tailed t-priors that shrink ATT's of small magnitudes toward zero. We provide a computationally efficient Bayesian estimation procedure and establish a Bernstein-von Mises-type result that justifies posterior inference for the treatment effects. Simulation studies confirm that our method performs well in both large and small samples, offering credible uncertainty quantification even in settings that challenge standard estimators. We illustrate the practical value of the method through an empirical application that examines the effect of minimum wage increases on teen employment in the United States.</description>
